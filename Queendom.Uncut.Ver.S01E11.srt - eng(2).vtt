00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:35.080
I feel the same
having the chance to work with you.

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:36.280
Look,

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:38.520
if you need any help,

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:39.640
don't hesitate to tell me.

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:42.160
Of course.

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:48.960
Sir!

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:50.920
I'm here for a job interview.

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:53.600
There's no reason
to be nice when you're evil.

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:59.440
And we...will reunite again

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:02.720
on the Milky...

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:03.400
Cut!

00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:04.120
Wow.

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:06.520
She's amazing.

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:07.960
She really is.

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:09.520
I'll contact you later.

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:11.200
Thank you very much, Print.

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:13.000
Please go ahead that way.

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:18.240
Who the heck
called her for the audition?

00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:20.040
Isn't she the one
with that fresh scandal?

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:21.880
Do you want our project to be screwed?

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:23.160
Jeez.

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:53.960
Ahem!

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.760
We made a promise, didn't we?

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:00.600
I was just...

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:02.280
putting it on silent mode.

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:03.760
Well, do it.

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:07.960
Okay!

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:09.640
- Is it on silent?
- Mm...

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:10.680
Then,

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:13.080
I'll keep it safe for you.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.680
- Now, get back to teaching!
- Alright, baby.

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:32.880
Put your hand here.

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:43.200
You did an amazing job
in that scene, Rey.

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:45.400
I'm not surprised

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:47.840
that you've become
a top-tier actress at such a young age.

00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:51.640
All thanks to you,
Nicha, for your emotional delivery.

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:55.120
For a second there,
I thought you were my real mother.

00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:05.560
I'm getting pretty hungry.

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:07.120
What should we eat?

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:09.360
What do you want to have?

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:12.000
How about we make something at home?

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.560
There are seven days in a week,

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:17.760
and yet we dine in eight days a week.

00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:20.000
I'm bored of that.

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:22.000
It'd be nice to dine out
once in a while!

00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:24.720
Uh...

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:27.920
Then,

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:29.440
give me my phone.

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:32.080
I'll look up
something nice to eat around here.

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:40.920
Fine.

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:43.600
Only for searching for
restaurants, though.

00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:45.760
I'll go to the restroom real quick.
I'll be right back.

00:15:58.560 --> 00:15:59.760
"Send the file ASAP."

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:02.240
Why now?

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:16.600
- Oh...
- Argh!

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:17.640
Ouch!

00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:20.560
Mai, what in the world are you doing?

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:23.520
I lost my contact lens.

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:25.200
- Huh?
- Yeah...

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:29.240
How did you even lose it?

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:30.280
Wait...

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:33.320
I think we should head back
to the office.

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:35.360
Just to put
my contact lens back on, alright?

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:37.840
Alright, fine. Let's go.

00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:40.720
It stings.

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:43.880
- This way.
- This?

00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:45.560
- I said this way!
- Alright, alright.

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:51.200
Fon!

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:51.880
Just wait here.

00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:53.480
I'll just take a sec to put it back on.

00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:55.480
Be right back.

00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:26.400
Fon!

00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:30.360
If anyone ever asks...

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.520
what your girlfriend's name is,

00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:34.680
are you gonna say it's "Work"?

00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:41.120
It's...

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:44.280
an urgent matter, Fon.

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:01.200
Alright,

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:03.600
white flag.

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:06.360
I admit I broke our deal today.

00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:11.280
Mai,

00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:13.160
do you think that I asked you on a date

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:14.720
just because I wanna win?

00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:18.000
Do you think this is a competition?

00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:21.880
I'm not...

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:23.800
I don't wanna
defeat you like I did before!

00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:26.160
- I really want to spend time with you!
- No...

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:28.880
I understand now.

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:30.600
I'm sorry.

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:34.840
Do you think I'm that easy?

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:37.080
You think you'll win me over
with a simple apology?

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:45.000
Fon...

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:50.600
how can I make it up to you?

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:53.280
Hm?

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:54.800
How?

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:57.360
Don't be mad at me, please?

00:18:58.240 --> 00:18:59.480
Does this work?

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:02.920
I'm sorry.

00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:04.760
I'm very sorry.

00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:07.040
Please?

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:08.560
I'm sorry.

00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:10.240
I'm sorry.

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:12.360
I'm sorry.

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:16.560
Forgive me, pretty please?

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.960
Cut it. Stay still.

00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:28.560
A bad girl

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:34.760
must be punished.

00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:25.000
[I won't break another promise]

00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:26.480
Sign it.

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:37.040
You're home, Rey?

00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:50.920
Can we just stay like this for a while?

00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:55.360
My wishes didn't work, did they?

00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:01.280
Look at how negative my image is now.

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:04.000
No one's interested
in what I can offer anymore!

00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:05.960
If they're not interested in you here,

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:07.880
then...

00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:09.520
should we go somewhere else?

00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:12.520
Somewhere else?

00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:17.920
Nicha recommended me
a film by a Korean producer.

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:20.240
If you're interested,

00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:22.120
we gotta send them an audition video.

00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:25.880
But it's already midnight, Rey.

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:28.360
If I force it,

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:29.720
will it even turn out well?

00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:31.160
It depends on...

00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:34.440
if you want me
to be your personal director.

00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:37.560
If you're my personal director,

00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:39.160
there's no need to pay me a dime.

00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:41.600
All I ask for is a little support...

00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:50.360
Are you ready?

00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:57.280
Three, two, one...

00:23:57.760 --> 00:23:59.360
And, action!

00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:02.720
Without you by my side,

00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:04.720
how am I supposed to live?

00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:08.680
Without me by your side,

00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:11.520
your life might be easier.

00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:16.480
That's true.

00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:21.160
My life...

00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:25.040
would be just as before you came in

00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:28.800
Just me by mysef

00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:30.120
When everything was simplier

00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:34.080
I could do whatever I wanted

00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:36.200
whenever I wanted

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:38.800
More peaceful

00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:42.000
...and far less chaotic

00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:45.200
But...

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:48.680
I wouldn’t be as happy as I am now

00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:52.240
Thank you...

00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:55.240
for fulfilling my life

00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:57.320
with so much meaning.

00:24:58.200 --> 00:24:58.960
Okay!

00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:01.920
You...

00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:05.360
are the greatest blessing in my life.

00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:23.560
Is it bad?

00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:26.120
Print...

00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:31.760
that was an amazing performance!

00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:36.120
How come you slay so hard?!

00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:37.440
Girl!

00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:38.800
- Darn!
- Gosh,

00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:41.440
Fon, you're so extra.

00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:42.560
I'm not!

00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:44.360
Your acting was epic!

00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:46.440
Be more confident in yourself.

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:49.480
And when will you know the result?

00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:53.280
As far as I know, within this month.

00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:58.960
But I don't know
if it's gonna make the cut.

00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:00.960
Girlie,

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:03.240
stop overthinking it.

00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:04.800
I think you have a shot,

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.680
considering you're a front-runner
for the Best New Actor award.

00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:11.920
Alright,

00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:13.160
cheers!

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:14.360
Cheers!

00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:32.360
Rey!

00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:34.840
What are you doing out here?

00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:36.560
You'll get eaten alive
by the mosquitoes.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.880
If you won the award,

00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:49.280
what would be your acceptance speech?

00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:51.040
Hm...

00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:53.040
I guess that never crossed my mind.

00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:55.000
I'm not even sure I'll get it.

00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:00.440
Have you heard about manifestation?

00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:03.560
Word is...

00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:06.000
if you envision
something vividly in your head,

00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:09.880
it might come true one day.

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:26.720
This award

00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:30.680
is not only a declaration
of my position as the Best Actress,

00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:32.800
but it is also

00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:35.160
a testament to all my dedication

00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:37.560
and effort,

00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:40.000
as well as that
of the staff from The Doll Mansion.

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:43.280
I would like
to share this award with the crew,

00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:45.880
those who never leave my side,

00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:48.440
and those that I love.

00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:50.960
This award...

00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:52.960
also belongs to Print.

00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:56.840
Wait a sec.

00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:01.360
Are you really gonna go all out?

00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:03.680
No,

00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:04.560
it's just...

00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:06.800
I can't say all this on the stage,

00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:10.960
so I want to say it to you today, Print.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:14.680
Mm!

00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:23.080
Can I ask you something?

00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:26.160
Are you really
not gonna talk to your mother?

00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:34.200
I know that,

00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:35.880
in reality,

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:38.560
you also feel bad

00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:40.800
for leaving her like this.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:47.800
Are you not angry at her?

00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:50.320
I'm not.

00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:52.640
Think of it this way:

00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:54.240
what would you do

00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:57.560
if someone's the reason
your daughter gives up her future,

00:28:57.600 --> 00:28:59.160
refuses to work abroad,

00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:00.640
and abandons her dream entirely?

00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:02.840
If that were me,

00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:04.760
I'd also hate their guts.

00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:12.480
Hello?

00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:14.960
Mai, where are you?
I'm already here.

Did you see the news on Twitter?

00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:41.760
I did, Sis.
That was brutal!

00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:44.280
I feel so bad for Rey.

00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:46.640
Feel bad about what?

00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:53.600
Wanmai!

00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:56.280
What is this about?

00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:58.000
Does Mother...

00:29:58.040 --> 00:29:59.480
Does Mother know?

00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:17.280
Miss Duen
already knows about this, Rey.

00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:20.080
And why...

00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:22.600
The reason she puts up with it

00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:24.040
and hasn't filed for a divorce

00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:27.520
is that she's afraid
she couldn't take care of you.

00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:35.280
She's afraid...

00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:37.320
your father's side
of the family will cut you off,

00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:40.120
especially your grandfather,

00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:43.800
who never accepted
your mother to begin with.

00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:47.160
And the reason
she forces her dream on you

00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:50.200
is not only because of herself.

00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:51.440
Please?

00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:53.960
Of course.

00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:56.200
Rey, thank the teacher.

00:30:57.480 --> 00:31:01.200
But she wants them to accept you.

00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:04.720
She's always worried about you.

00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:08.480
She calls me
to check on you all the time.

00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:11.720
Rey!

00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:19.280
I want to see Mother...

00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:27.800
Please be on standby in 10 minutes.

00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:45.520

everyone's waiting for...

00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:57.880
The announcement
of the Best Actress of the Year.

00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:00.040
We will now find out

00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:03.480
which actress gives
the most touching performance

00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:05.240
this year.

00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:09.000
As for this moment,

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:12.640
I hereby welcome
Miss Asamapon Samakphan,

00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:15.280
last year's Best Actress

00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:18.160
to please honor us
by presenting the award.

00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:29.480
Alright...

00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:32.560
The 2025 Best Actress

00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:34.120
goes to...

00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:44.320
Miss Rey Radubdao

00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:47.120
from The Doll Mansion!

00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:49.280
Congratulations!

00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:02.240
Congratulations.

00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:03.520
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:30.680
As a child,

00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:32.440
I used to stand in front of a mirror

00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:35.280
with a bottle of water in my hand,

00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:38.200
practicing my award acceptance speech.

00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:41.240
But now that the day has arrived,

00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:46.040
all those fancy words
just disappear from my head.

00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:49.800
All that's left now

00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:52.560
is how thankful I am

00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:55.960
for Pong, the director,

00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:58.920
and the crew members
of The Doll Mansion.

00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:03.160
Thank you, everyone, for your support.

00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:06.480
Most importantly,

00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:11.520
I wanna thank the person
who has always supported me,

00:34:12.720 --> 00:34:14.680
taken the time to push me forward,

00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:19.240
and put up with everything for my sake.

00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:23.000
Without her,

00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:25.520
I wouldn't...

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:28.200
I wouldn't be here.

00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:33.680
Thank you, Mother,

00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:38.840
for everything you've done for me.

00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:44.400
Without you...

00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:50.320
I wouldn't be who I am today.

00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:53.360
For that reason,

00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:58.200
this award

00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:00.560
is not only mine,

00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:04.640
but my mother's, too.

00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:37.560
Right,

00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:40.600
how was your mother's hospital visit?

00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:42.000
Why?

00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:44.320
If you're worried,
why don't you ask me directly?

00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:45.640
- Uh...
- Hm?

00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:46.920
Sorry, Mother...

00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:49.520
I mean, Auntie.

00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:50.360
I...

00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:52.840
I didn't know you were coming along,

00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:54.320
- so I...
- So you what?

00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:56.360
You don't want me here?

00:35:56.680 --> 00:35:59.160
It's not like that! You can come...

00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:03.960
So...what brings you here, Auntie?

00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:08.880
I just want to pay a visit
to my daughter's girlfriend's home.

00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:11.400
"My daughter's girlfriend"?!

00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:14.560
Mother, please stop teasing her.

00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:16.440
She's all shaken up.

00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:20.400
I never knew
my daughter-in-law is easily scared.

00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:23.120
I thought you were the spicy kind.

00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:26.400
Auntie!

00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:27.760
"Mother."

00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:29.080
Pardon?

00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:31.800
"Mother."

00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:35.520
Whoever told you to call me Auntie?

00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:39.720
Take care of Rey for me.

00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:43.080
And I apologize
for everything in the past.

00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:46.320
Of course, Mother!

00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:48.240
Mother!

00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:52.960
Mother!

00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:54.440
- Are you getting used to it?
- I am!

00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:08.320
I think we should have
someone fix Print's hair.

00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:10.560
Toei, go take a look
at Print's hair, please?

00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:11.400
Got it.

00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:16.040
Excuse me.

00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:21.360
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:25.880
- How does it look now?
- Good.

00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:27.720
Thanks.

00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:31.320
Alright, we're gonna start now.

00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:32.200
Let's go.

00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:34.320
Five, four,

00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:36.200
three, two, one...

00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:40.000
Please welcome, Print and Rey!

00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:41.640
Hello.

00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:43.200
Hi, and welcome back.

00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:45.120
I'll just cut to the chase.

00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:47.560
Last time, you told us

00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:49.240
you were besties,

00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:50.920
but, from the look of it...

00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:54.000
I'm smelling something sus...

00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:56.240
Can you tell us loud and clear

00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:59.360
what your relationship is?

00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:02.080
Are you a shipped couple
or a real couple?

00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:10.200
We are...

00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:31.200
Traffic's at a dead stop, Print.

00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:34.400
I think there's another crash
by the next intersection.

00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:38.440
Fon, I think it's time for plan B.

00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:42.160
Alright!

00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:46.880
Sir!

00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:50.040
Could you please
give her a ride to this place?

00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:51.760
Just follow the navigation here.

00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:54.200
Alright, get on the back!

00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:56.160
Okay, go!

00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:01.280
See you there, Fon.

00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:02.680
Alright, sit tight!

00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:07.600
- Ready?
- Let's go, sir.
