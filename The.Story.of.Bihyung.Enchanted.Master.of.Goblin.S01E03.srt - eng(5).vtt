00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.190
A long, long time ago,

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.950
there was a small village
at a deep mountain entrance.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.600
That village had a divine stone
that had been passed down for years.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.550
It was a protection stone with fragments of
the Mountain God.

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.410
Later generations called it Gildal.

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:37.320
This divine stone
stubbornly stood at the village gate,

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.310
enduring the sun, rain, snow, and wind,

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:45.030
guarding the village silently
for hundreds of years.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.400
This divine stone
had divine consciousness.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:55.130
A righteous person could pass by easily.

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:59.230
But those who had evil intentions
and might cause trouble to the village

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.620
would never pass by safely.

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.200
The divine stone would suddenly transform

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.960
and become a strong male

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.560
and wrestle with people all the time.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.560
Facing this battle they couldn't win,

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.240
the villains would
eventually become exhausted and leave.

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.520
But one day,

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.330
when the balance of
heaven and earth was in chaos,

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.950
a noble in Silla Palace named Bihyung

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.330
looked for ghosts and goblins.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.509
The rumor of this divine stone
was spread to the court.

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.240
Bihyung found this stone and said,

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.170
"Since you have judged justice
for so many years,

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.710
would you like to wear human clothes

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.050
and protect this world with me?"

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:58.580
With that said,

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.950
a goblin with sparkly eyes rose.

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.730
This person is Gildal
who had transformed into a human.

Malnutrition.

That's why you fainted on the road.

Wait. What time is it?

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:33.960
You just found out?

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:36.350
I smelled flowers—something sweet—
on a human.

00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:37.660
How do I put this?

00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:39.410
It's like I'm bewitched by him.

00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:41.400
Who is he?

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:42.610
Why do you ask?

00:15:42.610 --> 00:15:44.790
So that they can give me numbers
to buy a lottery ticket.

00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:45.430
What?

00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:48.880
A shaman is most powerful
right after they've been possessed.

00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:52.190
If this person's scent is enough to
bewitch the demons,

00:15:52.190 --> 00:15:55.810
then the gate of hell must be... open.

00:15:57.220 --> 00:16:01.150
Why would a human with no divine power
suddenly open the gate of hell...

00:16:02.490 --> 00:16:04.020
Could it be...

00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:11.170
There's only one reason.

00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:15.960
It's because he got too intimate
with non-humans, so it opened.

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:18.610
Intimate?

00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:29.260
Did you think of anything?

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:33.210
Could it be...
I don't think it's you, though.

00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:37.560
Gildal?

00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:49.680
-Bihyung, is your stomach feeling better?
-Where is Keumpoop?

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:51.740
He said he went for his part-time job.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.910
That human's in trouble.

00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:01.660
Since the gate of hell is open,

00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:04.200
all ghosts will come to him.

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:06.470
Sorry!

00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:16.200
Interesting.

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:18.990
So sweet.

00:17:30.210 --> 00:17:32.330
Grandpa?

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:37.310
Come here.

00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:44.630
Grandpa!

00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:46.570
Move! There are cars!

00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:54.830
Grandpa, it's dangerous!

00:17:57.590 --> 00:17:58.210
Grandpa!

00:17:58.210 --> 00:17:59.730
Move! It's dangerous! There are cars!

00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:01.330
Car!

00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:07.140
Grandpa!

00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:08.850
Move! There's a car coming!

00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:10.050
Grandpa!

00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:12.500
Hey! Grandpa!

00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:14.520
Th-There's a car!

00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:17.060
Move!

00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:36.460
Don't move.

00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:37.920
You'll die if you go there now.

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:39.160
Let go of me!

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:42.040
Please, let me go!

00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:08.750
What was that?

00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:26.310
What are you looking at?

00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:29.840
Go on with your work.

00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:34.100
You should be carrying things like this
to work out.
