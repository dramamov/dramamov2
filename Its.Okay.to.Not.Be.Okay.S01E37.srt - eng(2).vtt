WEBVTT

00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:04.546
I killed her.
She has come back to kill me.

00:00:04.629 --> 00:00:07.382
Do you believe
Mia's mother is still alive?

00:00:07.465 --> 00:00:09.426
That it's possible, she could return?

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:12.137
I'm open to the possibility.
You'll need to protect her.

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:14.556
- Can you stay at Jason's?
- Why?

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.767
I've got something
to take care of in Montanesa.

00:00:17.851 --> 00:00:20.729
Patpat doesn't like anyone. Only Matmat.

00:00:21.271 --> 00:00:23.148
I'll make Patrick happy.

00:00:23.231 --> 00:00:26.443
The kind of happiness he'll never forget.

00:00:27.277 --> 00:00:28.486
- Three!
- Ahh!

00:00:33.616 --> 00:00:34.909
Yeah!

00:00:36.494 --> 00:00:37.412
Whoo!

00:01:34.511 --> 00:01:38.348
{\an8}Yeah, that's it, Matmat.
Patrick said you should be here for now.

00:01:38.431 --> 00:01:40.767
{\an8}You'll be alone in that mansion.

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.103
{\an8}M-My
session with Doc is canceled?

00:01:44.187 --> 00:01:46.564
{\an8}Yes, Matmat. That's why
you should stay here for now.

00:01:46.648 --> 00:01:48.233
{\an8}- Okay? Let's go.
But…

00:01:48.316 --> 00:01:51.194
{\an8}But Matmat doesn't like your room.

00:01:51.277 --> 00:01:53.696
{\an8}I'd rather stay in my and Patpat's room.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.241
{\an8}Oh, oh! Fine. I'll come with you.

00:01:56.324 --> 00:01:58.409
{\an8}You're not allowed--What the--

00:01:58.493 --> 00:02:00.203
{\an8}I think a Tikbalang is getting married.

00:02:00.286 --> 00:02:05.250
{\an8}

00:02:06.167 --> 00:02:08.211
{\an8}What's this? What's happening here?

00:02:09.671 --> 00:02:11.548
{\an8}- What's this?!
A nice little break.

00:02:12.423 --> 00:02:13.716
{\an8}I'm on vacation, right?

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.301
{\an8}To cool down.

00:02:15.385 --> 00:02:17.512
{\an8}

00:02:17.595 --> 00:02:21.141
{\an8}What's with the wind?
All people think about is a vacation.

00:02:22.892 --> 00:02:24.602
{\an8}Hi, Sir Vincent!

00:02:26.146 --> 00:02:27.897
{\an8}Hi, Matmat!

00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:30.608
{\an8}My newest illustrator.

00:02:32.193 --> 00:02:34.028
{\an8}You know what, not that you're asking--

00:02:34.112 --> 00:02:35.822
{\an8}- No one's asking.
Usually,

00:02:35.905 --> 00:02:38.908
{\an8}I'm in El Nido, Maldives…

00:02:38.992 --> 00:02:41.452
{\an8}Ah, go book a flight then.
Go! Don't come back--

00:02:41.536 --> 00:02:42.537
{\an8}No! Shhh!

00:02:43.371 --> 00:02:46.541
{\an8}You see this?
I need to compromise for now.

00:02:46.624 --> 00:02:49.627
{\an8}The company is suffering a setback.
It's not earning much.

00:02:49.711 --> 00:02:51.838
{\an8}But, Matmat!

00:02:52.881 --> 00:02:55.592
If you do your best
and work well with Mia,

00:02:56.426 --> 00:03:00.513
we'll earn a lot. That's why,
you should finish the book quickly.

00:03:00.597 --> 00:03:03.558
So we can get back the losses.
Okay? Please!

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.936
{\an8}You know what Vincent,
I don't understand…

00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:11.149
{\an8}how you put the effort
to fill this up and inflate the pool

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.109
when the ocean is right there!

00:03:13.568 --> 00:03:14.903
Aren't you getting goosebumps from--

00:03:20.783 --> 00:03:22.994
{\an8}Aren't you ashamed
that Gemma might see you like this?

00:03:23.786 --> 00:03:25.079
{\an8}Jason,

00:03:25.163 --> 00:03:28.333
{\an8}-
I think that's the point.

00:03:28.875 --> 00:03:32.503
{\an8}- Gemma shouldn't see this

00:03:32.587 --> 00:03:36.507
{\an8}because Sir Vincent is taking a bath.

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.886
{\an8}You're right, Matmat. Let's go.

00:03:40.345 --> 00:03:42.263
- Sir Vincent.
- Hmm?

00:03:42.347 --> 00:03:44.724
Cover yourself. So cocky!

00:03:44.807 --> 00:03:45.600
Come on, Matmat.

00:03:45.683 --> 00:03:48.478
I love it here.

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:50.521
That was so much fun.

00:03:51.064 --> 00:03:52.649
You didn't seem scared earlier.

00:03:52.732 --> 00:03:54.359
I wasn't scared at all.

00:03:57.153 --> 00:03:59.656
I love that this was spontaneous.

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:02.283
'Cause I get to see the fun side of you.

00:04:06.162 --> 00:04:08.164
- Now, let's take a picture.
- Mia.

00:04:08.248 --> 00:04:09.415
Come on.

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:12.335
Let's take pictures so
you have memories to keep.

00:04:12.418 --> 00:04:13.544
There.

00:04:13.628 --> 00:04:15.004
Ready?

00:04:15.088 --> 00:04:16.172
Smile.

00:04:18.758 --> 00:04:20.551
Can't you do a bigger smile?

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.096
Come on. Smile!

00:04:24.764 --> 00:04:26.182
Smile like you mean it.

00:04:28.601 --> 00:04:31.437
One, two, three!

00:04:31.521 --> 00:04:33.273
Yes!

00:04:33.356 --> 00:04:36.442
One more. One, two, three!

00:04:37.735 --> 00:04:39.487
Let's take a picture together.

00:04:40.488 --> 00:04:41.906
There.

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:43.408
Closer.

00:04:43.491 --> 00:04:45.076
There you go.

00:04:45.785 --> 00:04:48.121
One, two, three!

00:04:48.204 --> 00:04:51.165
One, two, three.

00:04:57.505 --> 00:05:00.967
You know what,
you're cute when you're smiling.

00:05:04.595 --> 00:05:05.805
That's enough.

00:05:05.888 --> 00:05:08.599
No, let's find another angle.
This one's good.

00:05:09.934 --> 00:05:11.811
One, two, three.

00:05:13.396 --> 00:05:15.023
Enough.

00:05:15.106 --> 00:05:16.899
Let me see.

00:05:19.527 --> 00:05:21.988
I have to get this.
It might be an emergency.

00:05:24.324 --> 00:05:25.950
Hello?

00:05:35.126 --> 00:05:36.919
Your eyes…

00:05:48.056 --> 00:05:50.016
I feel like I've seen them before.

00:05:53.102 --> 00:05:55.271
Do you remember me now?

00:05:58.649 --> 00:06:00.151
Samuel?

00:06:04.572 --> 00:06:06.032
It's you.

00:06:13.748 --> 00:06:15.625
I've missed you.

00:06:20.171 --> 00:06:22.215
I've missed you, Samuel.

00:06:23.299 --> 00:06:25.218
You died already!

00:06:25.301 --> 00:06:26.719
You died!

00:06:26.803 --> 00:06:29.639
- Samuel!
- You're supposed to be dead!

00:06:29.722 --> 00:06:30.807
It's me!

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:34.018
You're not supposed to be alive! You died!

00:06:38.064 --> 00:06:41.109
- Go. Do it, Samuel.
- Die! Die!

00:06:41.192 --> 00:06:43.778
That's what happens
to people who meddle.

00:06:48.366 --> 00:06:51.285
Sorry.

00:06:51.369 --> 00:06:53.788
Sorry.

00:06:53.871 --> 00:06:55.164
Sorry.

00:06:56.207 --> 00:06:58.835
- Sorry…
- I understand why you did that.

00:07:00.545 --> 00:07:01.712
It's okay.

00:07:04.423 --> 00:07:06.175
At least, Samuel,

00:07:07.593 --> 00:07:09.470
you remember me now.

00:07:14.142 --> 00:07:17.103
Sorry, sorry.

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:20.356
Samuel…

00:07:31.159 --> 00:07:33.453
- Where are they?
- They're over there, sir.

00:07:34.579 --> 00:07:36.622
- Over that deck. Okay.
- Thank you, ma'am.

00:07:44.505 --> 00:07:46.466
Who's there? It's Miss Mia!

00:07:47.091 --> 00:07:48.426
Why did you sneak out?

00:07:51.345 --> 00:07:52.513
Patrick.

00:07:52.889 --> 00:07:56.058
You know I didn't get the chance
to say goodbye to Bella, right?

00:07:56.142 --> 00:07:57.685
How did you escape?

00:08:06.903 --> 00:08:08.529
Come on, hurry.

00:08:11.407 --> 00:08:14.911
Dr. Anok never locks his van.
You can sneak out with this.

00:08:14.994 --> 00:08:16.704
See? Get in.

00:08:17.705 --> 00:08:19.874
Hurry, get inside.

00:08:19.957 --> 00:08:21.459
Here, take this.

00:08:21.542 --> 00:08:24.837
I got all the nurses' numbers
from reception and listed them there.

00:08:24.921 --> 00:08:27.298
If anything goes wrong, just call them.

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:30.134
Miss Cynthia and Mister Tommy,

00:08:30.218 --> 00:08:31.552
thank you.

00:08:31.886 --> 00:08:33.429
I promise I'll make it up to you.

00:08:33.513 --> 00:08:35.139
Just go ahead and hide.

00:09:02.291 --> 00:09:04.335
Doc didn't notice
you were hiding in the back?

00:09:05.211 --> 00:09:06.504
He didn't see me.

00:09:06.921 --> 00:09:09.882
When he pulled over at a bakery,
I made my move and slipped out.

00:09:11.133 --> 00:09:14.345
I just really want
to be with Kai, just for today.

00:09:14.887 --> 00:09:18.349
You know that my dad's going
to take me to New York?

00:09:18.891 --> 00:09:20.309
I don't know

00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:23.104
when we'll see each other again.

00:09:26.774 --> 00:09:27.858
Patrick,

00:09:28.234 --> 00:09:30.486
I promise to go back
to the hospital tomorrow.

00:09:31.988 --> 00:09:36.409
Also, can I borrow some
money to pay for our room?

00:09:36.492 --> 00:09:38.786
I won't tell anyone you helped me.

00:09:39.704 --> 00:09:40.663
No.

00:09:41.038 --> 00:09:43.457
You're going home and we're
going back to the hospital. Come on.

00:09:43.916 --> 00:09:46.085
Hey, Patrick, wait!

00:09:47.628 --> 00:09:50.172
Please, take pity on us.

00:09:50.256 --> 00:09:52.341
To be honest, this is your fault.

00:09:52.425 --> 00:09:53.551
How's it my fault?

00:09:53.634 --> 00:09:56.762
Patrick, if you didn't hit my ex, then,

00:09:57.138 --> 00:09:59.140
then there wouldn't be any trouble.

00:09:59.849 --> 00:10:02.435
Papa wouldn't have
dragged me out of the hospital.

00:10:03.728 --> 00:10:05.104
Uh, bro…

00:10:05.479 --> 00:10:07.148
When you punched Bella's ex,

00:10:07.857 --> 00:10:09.400
I said to myself,

00:10:09.483 --> 00:10:12.528
if Patrick who always watches his temper

00:10:12.612 --> 00:10:14.155
couldn't hold it anymore,

00:10:14.655 --> 00:10:18.284
maybe I should also not
hold back my feelings for Bella.

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:22.663
It's true.

00:10:22.747 --> 00:10:23.998
They're right.

00:10:24.498 --> 00:10:26.334
You are to blame for all of this.

00:10:27.418 --> 00:10:29.045
That's why

00:10:29.128 --> 00:10:30.671
I already paid for your rooms.

00:10:31.672 --> 00:10:33.007
And also our room.

00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:34.300
Really, Miss Mia?

00:10:34.383 --> 00:10:36.594
Thank you, Miss Mia!
Thank you! Thank you so much!

00:10:36.677 --> 00:10:38.262
- You're welcome.
- You're the best!

00:10:39.221 --> 00:10:40.765
I can't stay here overnight.

00:10:40.848 --> 00:10:42.350
You're going to leave them?

00:10:42.725 --> 00:10:45.061
If we go,
you're going to leave your patients.

00:10:45.144 --> 00:10:47.647
Technically, I'm suspended.
Why should I look after them?

00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:49.190
If you're suspended,

00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:52.360
why are you insisting on
getting Kai back to the hospital?

00:10:53.944 --> 00:10:55.988
Yeah, bro. Miss Mia is right.

00:10:59.367 --> 00:11:01.035
Come on, Patrick.

00:11:02.328 --> 00:11:05.706
You were the one
who inspired them to do all this.

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:07.541
Let's stay here for the night.

00:11:07.625 --> 00:11:11.003
Then first thing tomorrow,
we'll get Kai back to the hospital.

00:11:21.722 --> 00:11:23.391
- Dear!
- Hello, Ma!

00:11:23.474 --> 00:11:24.809
Come on.

00:11:25.935 --> 00:11:28.145
- Have a seat.
- Hello, Matmat.

00:11:28.521 --> 00:11:29.647
Where's Patrick?

00:11:30.356 --> 00:11:33.150
Uh, he's not here.
He has to go to Montanesa.

00:11:33.234 --> 00:11:34.610
That's why Matmat is staying here.

00:11:34.693 --> 00:11:36.821
H-He…

00:11:37.905 --> 00:11:40.116
Patpat has to go somewhere.

00:11:40.199 --> 00:11:41.784
He'll be home late.

00:11:42.451 --> 00:11:43.452
Ah!

00:11:44.203 --> 00:11:46.497
Matmat, how's your job working with Mia?

00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:47.957
Have you done a lot?

00:11:49.083 --> 00:11:51.710
W-We haven't done any.

00:11:52.461 --> 00:11:54.922
Because she hasn't had any ideas yet.

00:11:55.548 --> 00:11:57.842
But I gained a best friend.

00:11:57.925 --> 00:11:59.677
Really? You're best friends now?

00:12:00.761 --> 00:12:01.929
I-It's Mia.

00:12:02.596 --> 00:12:06.434
She said we're best friends.
She's my bestie now.

00:12:07.017 --> 00:12:11.730
If you guys are best friends,
you should invite her here.

00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:14.150
She's not here.

00:12:16.193 --> 00:12:19.113
Uh, What do you mean? Where's Mia?

00:12:20.489 --> 00:12:23.409
I-I don't know. She also went out.

00:12:23.492 --> 00:12:25.828
Huh? Both of them are gone?

00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:29.748
Maybe Patrick and Miss Mia are together?

00:12:36.005 --> 00:12:37.339
Oh, please, Madeth.

00:12:37.423 --> 00:12:41.343
Are you a writer too like Mia?
You're making such plot twists.

00:12:41.802 --> 00:12:44.096
No. Just maybe, right?

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:45.806
Patrick went out and Miss Mia too.

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:48.100
And wherever Patrick is,
Miss Mia's there too.

00:12:48.184 --> 00:12:51.270
- Who knows they might be--
- Say 'ahh'.

00:12:51.353 --> 00:12:54.231
Ah! Very good. There.

00:12:54.315 --> 00:12:56.567
- Oh, Madeth.
- Just maybe.

00:12:57.234 --> 00:12:58.736
Just maybe.

00:12:59.653 --> 00:13:02.781
Let's not speak about the
ones who aren't here. Eat up, eat up.

00:13:06.577 --> 00:13:07.745
Here. Eat up.

00:13:09.038 --> 00:13:11.415
- Dear, please eat.
- Yeah. Matmat, here.

00:13:11.499 --> 00:13:12.791
Do you want this?

00:13:43.072 --> 00:13:44.740
Patrick?

00:13:45.658 --> 00:13:47.076
Patrick, look.

00:13:47.159 --> 00:13:48.869
The owner gave it to us.

00:13:49.578 --> 00:13:51.163
It's flavored coconut liquor.

00:13:51.247 --> 00:13:52.748
Do you think it's safe to drink?

00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:56.669
Maybe it's a local product.

00:14:00.673 --> 00:14:02.633
If I die from drinking this,

00:14:02.716 --> 00:14:05.761
tell the funeral
parlor to do my makeup well

00:14:05.844 --> 00:14:08.389
or else my spirit won't be at peace.

00:14:10.975 --> 00:14:12.726
I just need to call someone.

00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:14.603
Okay. Then let's drink?

00:14:27.283 --> 00:14:28.367
Hello?

00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:30.828
Hello, Matmat…

00:14:31.912 --> 00:14:33.122
What are you doing?

00:14:33.998 --> 00:14:38.252
Matmat is just
drawing before going to sleep.

00:14:39.295 --> 00:14:40.963
Are you on your way home, Patpat?

00:14:41.964 --> 00:14:44.300
The thing is, uh…

00:14:46.343 --> 00:14:48.012
I might be home in the morning.

00:14:51.181 --> 00:14:54.101
Why? Are there no more buses?

00:14:56.312 --> 00:14:57.938
No, it's uh…

00:15:00.107 --> 00:15:02.860
I need to accompany someone.

00:15:03.694 --> 00:15:05.696
Uh, a patient.

00:15:06.864 --> 00:15:08.157
Have you eaten?

00:15:10.618 --> 00:15:13.370
Are you at M-Mama Li's?

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:15.748
No, but I'm okay, Matmat.

00:15:16.749 --> 00:15:18.250
O-Okay.

00:15:18.334 --> 00:15:22.671
Wake up early tomorrow
so you can commute faster.

00:15:24.298 --> 00:15:25.466
Okay, Matmat.

00:15:26.091 --> 00:15:29.720
Don't forget to brush your teeth
and your hair before bed. Okay?

00:15:29.803 --> 00:15:33.891
Matmat knows that.
I can take care of myself.

00:15:33.974 --> 00:15:37.227
Okay. Call me if you need me.

00:15:37.645 --> 00:15:38.562
Okay?

00:15:38.646 --> 00:15:40.814
Okay. You too.

00:15:41.899 --> 00:15:43.067
Good night, Matmat.

00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:46.362
Good night.

00:16:01.502 --> 00:16:03.170
So this is what it's like
to be someone's secret lover.

00:16:05.464 --> 00:16:06.590
What are you saying?

00:16:07.633 --> 00:16:10.552
I feel like a mistress
you're hiding from the legal wife

00:16:10.636 --> 00:16:14.515
because you haven't told
Matmat that you're here with me.

00:16:17.309 --> 00:16:19.520
When have the mistress
and the wife ever been besties?

00:16:22.564 --> 00:16:23.524
But thank you.

00:16:23.607 --> 00:16:25.442
For being your secret lover?

00:16:25.526 --> 00:16:27.569
For being Matmat's friend.

00:16:28.904 --> 00:16:30.739
That was Mama's dream for him.

00:16:32.241 --> 00:16:33.242
You made it come true

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:37.037
You're welcome.

00:16:38.998 --> 00:16:41.166
I think this calls for a celebration.

00:16:42.376 --> 00:16:43.419
Let's drink?

00:16:52.469 --> 00:16:57.099
Um, sissy Gemma, you seem a little quiet.

00:17:02.271 --> 00:17:04.648
What's wrong? Um…

00:17:04.732 --> 00:17:06.483
Is your body tired?

00:17:06.567 --> 00:17:10.237
Or did your heart get tired after hearing

00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:13.490
that Mia and Patrick might be together?

00:17:14.825 --> 00:17:16.368
You said it yourself, right?

00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:18.579
We're not meant for each other.

00:17:19.288 --> 00:17:22.041
It's a waste to love
someone who won't love you back.

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:37.806
I'm not saying I still have hope.

00:17:39.433 --> 00:17:41.226
But it's still hard to accept.

00:17:43.562 --> 00:17:45.564
For me, this is what I believe in.

00:17:45.647 --> 00:17:48.817
While you're still alive,
there's always hope.

00:17:49.902 --> 00:17:52.821
But I hope I don't lose hope
when it comes to being with you.

00:17:55.532 --> 00:17:58.077
There's no use. Madeth's in the bathroom.

00:17:59.286 --> 00:18:02.539
- Hurry, come over here.
- Miss Li, hey!

00:18:02.956 --> 00:18:06.668
Don't bother them. They might be
talking about something important.

00:18:07.169 --> 00:18:08.712
Mama Li, that's not fair.

00:18:08.796 --> 00:18:11.006
- Biases are for K-Pop fans.
- Shh!

00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:12.508
What are you trying to say?

00:18:13.509 --> 00:18:17.179
How come Vincent gets to
flirt with Gemma and I don't?

00:18:17.262 --> 00:18:19.681
Okay, okay. I understand.

00:18:19.765 --> 00:18:22.768
I'm all for whoever
my daughter wants, right?

00:18:22.851 --> 00:18:26.897
But for now, maybe sit this one out?

00:18:27.606 --> 00:18:29.149
Alright? Come on.

00:18:29.233 --> 00:18:31.902
Let's go get some fresh air.
You look like you need it.

00:18:31.985 --> 00:18:33.403
Come on, come on.

00:18:33.487 --> 00:18:34.905
I'll even come with you.

00:18:36.490 --> 00:18:38.492
Has anyone ever told
you how annoying you are?

00:18:39.743 --> 00:18:41.912
Of course. Many times.

00:18:42.871 --> 00:18:45.624
But I don't really see it as a bad thing.

00:18:46.291 --> 00:18:49.920
I see it as part of my
many endearing qualities.

00:18:51.463 --> 00:18:53.674
That's why you work for Mia.

00:18:53.757 --> 00:18:55.342
Hey! No.

00:18:56.552 --> 00:18:59.346
I'm the one who can
handle Mia's annoying side.

00:18:59.429 --> 00:19:00.931
Not the other way around.

00:19:02.057 --> 00:19:03.183
Look at me.

00:19:03.267 --> 00:19:05.394
I'm still here in Maravida.

00:19:05.769 --> 00:19:07.020
I didn't leave her alone.

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:09.273
And why is that?

00:19:10.566 --> 00:19:12.526
You can go out and
look for a different writer.

00:19:12.609 --> 00:19:14.528
But you keep
following Mia like a lost puppy.

00:19:17.239 --> 00:19:19.408
I don't know. I just can't leave her.

00:19:20.784 --> 00:19:22.828
You know, the thing about Mia.

00:19:23.871 --> 00:19:28.458
She won't admit it,
but she's a very sad person.

00:19:29.376 --> 00:19:30.460
Yes.

00:19:44.892 --> 00:19:46.435
Just like Patrick, I guess.

00:19:48.395 --> 00:19:49.813
He's good at hiding his feelings.

00:19:50.689 --> 00:19:52.191
He's good at avoiding his problems.

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:55.152
He's good at keeping secrets.

00:19:57.362 --> 00:19:59.323
Maybe that's why
he's a good match for Mia.

00:20:04.661 --> 00:20:05.787
One more.

00:20:05.871 --> 00:20:07.164
I don't want to drink anymore.

00:20:07.247 --> 00:20:08.874
- I've had enough.
- Oh, come on.

00:20:08.957 --> 00:20:09.958
Last drink.

00:20:10.334 --> 00:20:12.127
- Last drink.
- Oh, please.

00:20:14.296 --> 00:20:15.797
Straight.

00:20:26.308 --> 00:20:27.809
Why are you laughing?

00:20:32.272 --> 00:20:36.151
I'm just so happy with the people
I have in my life right now.

00:20:36.235 --> 00:20:37.569
Mm-hmm.

00:20:37.653 --> 00:20:42.324
I have a bestie
who I like to call Matmat.

00:20:44.034 --> 00:20:45.118
And…

00:20:45.702 --> 00:20:47.454
I have you.

00:20:52.376 --> 00:20:55.837
Hmm.

00:20:55.921 --> 00:20:57.464
Oh, you're blushing.

00:20:57.547 --> 00:21:00.342
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

00:21:00.425 --> 00:21:01.510
Hey.

00:21:02.010 --> 00:21:04.304
You've fallen for me already, huh?

00:21:04.388 --> 00:21:05.847
No, Mia.

00:21:05.931 --> 00:21:08.100
- Just admit it, Patrick.
- No.

00:21:08.183 --> 00:21:09.726
I'm going to bed now, Mia.

00:21:09.810 --> 00:21:11.353
Oh.

00:21:12.312 --> 00:21:13.480
Hmm?

00:21:13.939 --> 00:21:15.524
I told you you're drunk.

00:21:16.149 --> 00:21:17.818
But not drunk in love with me.

00:21:17.901 --> 00:21:19.820
Go get some rest.

00:21:29.913 --> 00:21:31.581
- Mia.
- Hmm?

00:21:32.958 --> 00:21:34.835
Go sleep at Kai's room.

00:21:35.544 --> 00:21:36.545
Huh?

00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:38.171
Why?

00:21:40.132 --> 00:21:42.718
Or stay with Bella. Wherever you want.

00:21:46.847 --> 00:21:47.931
Patrick.

00:21:48.432 --> 00:21:49.975
Oh, Patrick.

00:21:52.811 --> 00:21:54.521
- Tomorrow…
- Hmm?

00:21:55.022 --> 00:21:57.190
…Kai will go back to the hospital.

00:21:57.274 --> 00:22:00.027
That means it's
the lover's last night together.

00:22:00.986 --> 00:22:03.363
You should let them
have this night for themselves.

00:22:10.454 --> 00:22:11.663
Hey.

00:22:12.622 --> 00:22:14.583
Don't you turn your back on me.

00:22:16.668 --> 00:22:18.420
I want to see your face.

00:22:28.555 --> 00:22:30.974
You smile more now.

00:22:31.058 --> 00:22:33.935
Like earlier on the beach.

00:22:34.936 --> 00:22:36.313
And right now.

00:22:41.526 --> 00:22:43.528
I'm just happy I'm with you.

00:22:46.323 --> 00:22:47.657
You make me smile.

00:22:49.117 --> 00:22:50.535
I can't stop it.

00:22:53.872 --> 00:22:55.332
This isn't enough.

00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:57.751
What?

00:22:58.543 --> 00:23:00.378
This isn't enough for me.

00:23:00.754 --> 00:23:01.755
Hmm?

00:23:03.799 --> 00:23:04.716
Mia?

00:23:06.343 --> 00:23:08.970
Mia! Mia?!

00:23:11.181 --> 00:23:12.182
Mia?

00:23:12.557 --> 00:23:13.558
Mia?

00:23:14.351 --> 00:23:15.644
Mia, what are you going to do?

00:23:15.727 --> 00:23:17.312
Mia! Mia!

00:23:17.395 --> 00:23:19.397
Come here.

00:23:19.481 --> 00:23:21.233
- Mia, stop it.
- Patrick.

00:23:21.316 --> 00:23:22.526
Stop playing hard to get.

00:23:22.609 --> 00:23:23.777
Mia, cut it out.

00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:25.654
Patrick.

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:34.412
What do you think?

00:23:35.956 --> 00:23:39.042
Who loves more?

00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:43.213
The moon, or the stars?

00:23:44.131 --> 00:23:45.590
Hmm.

00:23:46.925 --> 00:23:48.218
Who do you think…

00:23:48.844 --> 00:23:51.096
has been there longer?

00:23:54.307 --> 00:23:55.600
I have no idea.

00:23:58.854 --> 00:24:00.605
I think,

00:24:00.689 --> 00:24:03.024
whoever's been up there longer,

00:24:04.067 --> 00:24:06.570
is more patient.

00:24:09.030 --> 00:24:11.491
And whoever is more patient,

00:24:12.242 --> 00:24:14.744
that's who loves more.

00:24:17.789 --> 00:24:18.790
Hmm.

00:24:19.332 --> 00:24:20.584
You think so?

00:24:22.127 --> 00:24:23.128
Yeah.

00:24:24.045 --> 00:24:25.380
That's how love is.

00:24:32.304 --> 00:24:34.181
If we'd gotten closer back then,

00:24:34.264 --> 00:24:35.932
I wonder how things would be now.

00:24:36.016 --> 00:24:36.933
Mama would still be alive.

00:24:37.017 --> 00:24:38.435
Do you blame me?

00:24:39.644 --> 00:24:41.354
Do you know where they are?

00:24:41.438 --> 00:24:43.773
Something might happen to them.

00:24:43.857 --> 00:24:46.151
Don't leave Matmat, Patpat.

00:24:46.234 --> 00:24:48.236
Patpat's still not here.

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:50.447
It's not because I'm enjoying
my time or because I feel relaxed.

00:24:50.530 --> 00:24:53.950
but because you told me
to not burden myself with regret.

00:24:54.034 --> 00:24:56.953
- They're beautiful.
- Beautiful, just like you.
