00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.750
A long, long time ago,

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.410
there was a being who was
neither human nor demon.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.410
It was a beautiful life
born of a human and a Gumiho.

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.100
The Gumihos looked down on him,

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:34.220
and humans were afraid of him, as he's
a fox that would eat human organs.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:40.390
He felt belonging to
neither of those two places.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.450
He had no choice but to live alone
over the boundary.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.200
He's honest and innocent.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.450
He tried not to hurt anyone.

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.280
Even if it's a little kindness,
he's sincere.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:01.760
But the world didn't know
his sincerity.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.810
Every word he speaks,

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:07.800
or his silence,
can sometimes be taken as lies.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.110
And a choice he made
was seen as a betrayal.

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.470
At the end of the day,
he's not a human nor a fox.

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.539
He was forced to have nowhere to go.

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:22.720
At the gate of Seorabeol,
[T/N: Seorabeol is the capital of Silla,
now Gyeongju, North Gyeongsang Province.]

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.530
the day Queen Seondeok arrived,

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.110
he looked up at the sky and prayed.

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.060
I dare not admire you;

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.539
I just want a place I belong to
in this world.

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:40.800
Be it with the humans or the Gumihos.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.100
I just hope for a name I can live in.

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.570
After saying that, he fell asleep.

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.390
The Queen pitied him,

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:58.470
passed by him,
and put a gold bracelet on his chest.

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.820
When he woke up,

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.000
the first thing that came to his heart
was not joy,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.740
but a strong feeling of missing
and unspeakable regret.

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.760
These thoughts burned throughout his body.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.180
He was swallowed by this blazing energy

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.260
and eventually became the symbol of fire:

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.670
the God of Fire.

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:27.490
Since that day,

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.750
his name Jigwi

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:35.120
became a metaphor for someone
who doesn't fit in anywhere.

00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:08.350
Before I came to Seoul,
my grandpa gave me this amulet.

00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:09.830
Why?

00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:13.880
It looks like something I've seen before.

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:16.900
Where did your grandpa pick this up?

00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:19.070
He said I picked it up when I was a kid.

00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:21.080
My grandpa kept it since then.

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:24.940
Since I picked it up,
I suddenly recovered.

00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:28.570
That's really your amulet.

00:12:31.170 --> 00:12:32.870
I threw mine away.

00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:35.240
Excuse me.

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:37.310
Can I hold onto you?

00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:38.520
It's night, after all.

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:41.290
Are you a kid? Why are you scared?

00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:43.920
You have my energy on you,
so you will be fine for a while.

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:45.760
Even so...

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:50.690
You're faster than me.
Since you have long legs.

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:12.620
Thank you for today.

00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:14.480
I know.

00:13:15.950 --> 00:13:17.530
I'm sorry.

00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:19.770
If you're sorry, buy me ice cream.

00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:23.180
You want a lot of things.

00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:24.820
You said you were sorry.

00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:25.970
I don't feel sorry anymore.

00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:27.330
How can you do that?

00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:28.610
Whatever. Shoo.

00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:30.840
Then I'll see ghosts again.

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:31.830
What ice cream do you want?

00:13:31.830 --> 00:13:34.080
Gosh. What a pain.

00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:48.510
You'll get a stomach upset.

00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:52.800
Where's the thing I asked you to find?

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:56.200
Why are you suddenly looking for books
on divine sicknesses?

00:13:57.530 --> 00:13:58.760
I have a sickness after all.

00:13:58.760 --> 00:13:59.890
I want to cure it.

00:13:59.890 --> 00:14:01.630
The one you talked about?

00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:03.200
But why are you curing it?

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:04.590
'Cause I caused it.

00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:06.520
What?

00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:09.340
Are you saying you
came into physical contact with a human?

00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:11.810
So intense that the gate of hell opened?

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:15.530
What happened?

00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:17.280
Do you have photos of them?

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:20.610
How pretty does this human have to be?

00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:23.420
Why didn't Gildal tell me?

00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:26.200
Oh. Are they a man or a woman?

00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:31.790
He's just like that guy.

00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:34.260
Could it be

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.950
the person who was your owner?

00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:41.090
Don't tell me you are expecting him

00:14:41.090 --> 00:14:44.860
to be a reborn of your master.

00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:50.080
You know that too.

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:53.420
If he were your master,
he would have recognized you.

00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:56.290
No matter how many times
they've been reborn.

00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:01.800
I don't have any expectations.

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:03.820
It's been a thousand years.

00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:07.920
If he wanted to find me,

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:10.610
he would have come to me.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.850
Where are you going?

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:21.320
Have some squid before leaving!

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:27.990
To look cold normally,
but when I smile, I'd look cute.

00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:29.360
My nose bridge should be about this tall.

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:31.280
Round and cute.

00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:33.140
Thick double eyelids would be nice.

00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:35.620
That'd give me sharp and charismatic eyes.

00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:39.510
Someone that everyone would think
is handsome; like a city guy.

00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:45.530
I want to praise you
for being so specific...

00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:51.870
Why don't you just bring me someone
who looks like this

00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:53.550
so I can just put their head on you.

00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:57.390
But doctor, that's not
plastic surgery anymore.

00:15:57.390 --> 00:16:00.540
I can assure you that
the side effect will be less by doing that.

00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:02.630
In other words...

00:16:02.630 --> 00:16:06.760
I'm afraid you can never be a "city guy"
in this lifetime.

00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:20.250
I didn't expect you to really come.

00:16:20.250 --> 00:16:21.870
What?

00:16:23.010 --> 00:16:26.540
You said you wanted to have a new image
for your audition, right?

00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:28.990
Do you want to get some fillers?

00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:30.700
I'll give you a discount.

00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:34.790
Actually, I don't have any money.

00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:36.320
Then why are you here?

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:37.080
Well, the Face Evaluation...

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:40.760
I mean, someone recommended this to me.

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:43.000
I thought I should
do something about it first.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.450
I'm... really desperate.

00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:48.000
You're really...

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.800
Reckless?

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:53.940
That's one thing.

00:16:56.590 --> 00:16:58.840
You're so naive.

00:17:13.119 --> 00:17:13.859
Come in.

00:17:13.859 --> 00:17:15.890
I'll give you a ride.

00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:30.590
I've taken care of everything.
What about you?

00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:33.440
I've eliminated
most of the things you mentioned.

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:35.380
Clear up whatever you see.

00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:40.010
Okay. But why are you suddenly doing this?

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:43.060
Can I hold onto you?

00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:45.010
It's night, after all.

00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:54.270
The kid said he's afraid
of walking at night.

00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:58.490
You don't have to send me home.

00:17:58.490 --> 00:18:00.640
I want to.

00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:07.190
Why?

00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:10.340
I just think
you're probably quite popular.

00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:12.890
This just feels like a foul.

00:18:12.890 --> 00:18:14.170
What do you mean?

00:18:14.170 --> 00:18:15.450
There are people like that.

00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:17.010
They don't have any interest,

00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:20.540
but would subconsciously make
other people's hearts flutter.

00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:23.590
Then what are you?

00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:25.580
Zero foul type?

00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:26.810
What?

00:18:27.790 --> 00:18:30.760
Or that you're the type so innocent that

00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:33.430
you'd make people feel guilty?

00:18:35.850 --> 00:18:37.590
Hold on.

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:41.450
[Gildal]

00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:44.330
Yes, hyung.

00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:46.420
Yes, I'm on my way back.

00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:47.700
You want to pick me up?

00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:49.800
It's fine, I'm not a kid.

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:50.510
Okay.

00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:52.020
See you at home.

00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:53.900
Okay.

00:18:57.760 --> 00:18:59.130
Your partner?

00:18:59.130 --> 00:19:00.880
What?

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:03.510
I guess you haven't started dating.

00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:04.880
Wasn't the person who called just now
your partner?

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:07.440
No! We are just roommates!

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:08.960
Roommates...

00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:13.250
Oh... Roommates that live together.

00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:14.850
Yes.

00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:06.460
You really live here?

00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:08.400
What?

00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:11.550
Nothing.

00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:14.610
I just think it's fate.

00:20:14.610 --> 00:20:16.640
Someone I know lives here too.

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:18.290
No way!

00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:22.340
Is it Gildal?

00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:23.480
Yes.

00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:24.580
Wow.

00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:28.100
Are you friends with him?

00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:28.980
That's amazing!

00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:32.630
Gildal was the one who invited me to
stay with him after all.

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:34.310
That's interesting.

00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:35.920
Right?

00:20:39.370 --> 00:20:42.570
He's someone who doesn't allow anyone
to get close to him.

00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:49.570
Thank you.

00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:51.870
I'm curious what secret you've used.

00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:13.700
Keumbok.

00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:14.850
See you again.

00:21:14.850 --> 00:21:16.280
Huh? When?

00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:19.100
Anytime. As long as you're free.

00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:21.390
I have a lot of time.

00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:23.370
But why?

00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:27.180
I just think I might want to see you.

00:21:27.970 --> 00:21:28.880
Sure!

00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:31.150
I've never made friends in Seoul.

00:21:31.150 --> 00:21:34.040
Not as a friend.

00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:35.960
What?

00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:41.210
I'm asking you out on a date.

00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:43.730
What?

00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:51.890
[CEO: Cheoyong]
