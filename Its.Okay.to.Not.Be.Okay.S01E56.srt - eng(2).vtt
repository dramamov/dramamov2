WEBVTT

00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:03.044
Let me do my job!

00:00:03.128 --> 00:00:04.504
I'm the nurse manager now,

00:00:04.587 --> 00:00:07.340
and I'm removing Samuel
from under your monitoring.

00:00:07.424 --> 00:00:08.925
- But--
- But what, Olivia?

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:11.010
Mia's part of my family now, Ma.

00:00:11.094 --> 00:00:13.680
She and Matmat are
the most important to me right now.

00:00:13.763 --> 00:00:16.766
Once I prove
that Ma'am Ingrid is still alive,

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.060
I want her to pay
for what she did to you.

00:00:19.144 --> 00:00:20.270
But if I go down that path,

00:00:20.353 --> 00:00:22.355
- Happy Day!
- it might affect Mia.

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.399
Am I one of those people you'll protect?

00:00:24.482 --> 00:00:26.526
Mia, you're part of our family now.

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.070
It's okay for Mia and Patpat to kiss

00:00:29.154 --> 00:00:33.908
as long as Mia and Patpat don't fight.

00:00:33.992 --> 00:00:35.452
We're not leaving Mia.

00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:37.537
We'll stick together.

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.137
Matmat,
I see you're painting again.

00:01:37.347 --> 00:01:38.598
Mister Tommy!

00:01:38.681 --> 00:01:39.974
{\an8}H-Happy Day!

00:01:40.058 --> 00:01:40.975
{\an8}

00:01:41.059 --> 00:01:42.560
{\an8}I'm sure this will make you happy.

00:01:42.644 --> 00:01:43.561
{\an8}- Here.

00:01:43.645 --> 00:01:47.482
{\an8}Thank you for all your help,

00:01:47.565 --> 00:01:51.194
{\an8}and for lending me that book.

00:01:51.277 --> 00:01:54.447
{\an8}D-Did Mister Tommy love the book?

00:01:54.531 --> 00:02:00.203
{\an8}Did he enjoy the story of
"The Kid Batibat Visited"?

00:02:00.286 --> 00:02:01.287
{\an8}Absolutely!

00:02:01.371 --> 00:02:03.206
{\an8}- I know it by heart now.

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:05.166
{\an8}By the way, Matmat…

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.294
{\an8}are you able to paint butterflies now?

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.213
{\an8}

00:02:10.296 --> 00:02:12.632
{\an8}Not yet.

00:02:12.715 --> 00:02:15.135
{\an8}Not yet, Mister Tommy.

00:02:15.218 --> 00:02:17.971
{\an8}Matmat still can't paint butterflies.

00:02:18.054 --> 00:02:20.765
{\an8}But Matmat will try.

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:22.392
{\an8}He will keep trying.

00:02:22.892 --> 00:02:24.519
{\an8}I'm curious.

00:02:24.602 --> 00:02:25.937
{\an8}

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.482
{\an8}Who do you think will
be the first between us?

00:02:30.108 --> 00:02:31.985
{\an8}First in what, Mister Tommy?

00:02:32.986 --> 00:02:34.404
{\an8}Is there a race?

00:02:34.487 --> 00:02:36.865
{\an8}I'm
not talking about a race.

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.993
{\an8}Who will be-- Who will be first?

00:02:40.785 --> 00:02:44.164
{\an8}You painting butterflies…

00:02:44.247 --> 00:02:45.832
{\an8}

00:02:45.915 --> 00:02:48.626
{\an8}…or me getting past my trauma?

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.546
{\an8}

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:58.303
{\an8}It… It depends on
who will find the door first.

00:02:59.012 --> 00:03:00.763
{\an8}Mister Tommy or Matmat?

00:03:00.847 --> 00:03:02.932
{\an8}You remember!

00:03:03.016 --> 00:03:04.225
{\an8}You're right!

00:03:05.101 --> 00:03:09.355
{\an8}May we find the door at the same time,

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:12.275
{\an8}so we can leave together.

00:03:12.358 --> 00:03:13.693
{\an8}

00:03:13.776 --> 00:03:16.821
{\an8}W-We will leave side by side.

00:03:16.905 --> 00:03:19.532
{\an8}

00:03:21.034 --> 00:03:22.368
{\an8}

00:03:30.627 --> 00:03:32.795
- Ma'am Eden.
- Patrick.

00:03:33.922 --> 00:03:35.798
I was hoping to talk to you.

00:03:37.133 --> 00:03:38.384
What about?

00:03:40.094 --> 00:03:42.222
I want you to give Mia a heads-up,

00:03:42.722 --> 00:03:45.934
since you're always together.

00:03:46.017 --> 00:03:47.143
Mia is aware that--

00:03:47.227 --> 00:03:48.645
Let me finish.

00:03:51.147 --> 00:03:52.482
All I'm saying is,

00:03:53.441 --> 00:03:55.652
if she needs to organize any documents

00:03:55.735 --> 00:03:58.196
or say anything to her father,

00:03:59.197 --> 00:04:00.281
now is the time.

00:04:03.368 --> 00:04:05.119
Alright, I'll tell her that.

00:04:06.037 --> 00:04:08.331
Make sure she understands, Patrick.

00:04:10.083 --> 00:04:12.293
So that on her next visit,

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.421
she can focus on her father.

00:04:53.209 --> 00:04:54.294
Nurse…

00:04:59.757 --> 00:05:00.800
Nurse?

00:05:03.636 --> 00:05:04.971
Are you a nurse?

00:05:06.514 --> 00:05:07.598
Samuel.

00:05:08.141 --> 00:05:09.350
It's me.

00:05:12.478 --> 00:05:14.689
Get me out of here.

00:05:21.404 --> 00:05:23.489
Please get me out of this place.

00:05:26.617 --> 00:05:28.453
I've had enough of this place.

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.087
I don't want to die here.

00:06:22.632 --> 00:06:23.716
Mia.

00:06:24.884 --> 00:06:26.761
Matmat. You're here.

00:06:27.303 --> 00:06:28.554
How long have you been here?

00:06:29.722 --> 00:06:34.519
Mmm. Matmat just
finished his work at OK Hospital.

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:37.188
Perfect.

00:06:37.271 --> 00:06:39.315
I have something to discuss with you.

00:06:47.198 --> 00:06:50.368
Is this the latest
draft of your illustrations?

00:06:51.285 --> 00:06:54.789
T-Those are Mister Box,

00:06:54.872 --> 00:06:56.374
Mask Boy,

00:06:56.457 --> 00:07:00.378
and Princess Without Feelings.

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.046
They don't have faces.

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:04.340
They're human characters.
They need faces.

00:07:04.924 --> 00:07:08.427
Mask Boy and Mister Box…

00:07:08.511 --> 00:07:11.556
T-They have their faces hidden.

00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:14.976
They don't need f-facial details.

00:07:17.061 --> 00:07:18.396
In all of my books,

00:07:18.479 --> 00:07:20.314
the characters have faces.

00:07:20.398 --> 00:07:22.775
They may not have proper nouns as names,

00:07:22.859 --> 00:07:24.861
but it's important
that they do have faces.

00:07:24.944 --> 00:07:26.863
It's hard. It's hard.

00:07:26.946 --> 00:07:30.950
M-Matmat just cannot draw faces.

00:07:31.033 --> 00:07:33.327
It's too hard. Too hard.

00:07:33.411 --> 00:07:34.912
Listen, Matmat.

00:07:34.996 --> 00:07:37.874
You have a poster of expressions, right?

00:07:37.957 --> 00:07:39.625
You can learn from it.

00:07:41.002 --> 00:07:43.796
Matmat looks at it.

00:07:44.547 --> 00:07:48.134
How about you start practicing?

00:07:48.676 --> 00:07:51.554
You want Matmat to practice?

00:07:51.637 --> 00:07:52.638
Yes.

00:07:52.722 --> 00:07:55.224
They say practice makes progress.

00:07:55.308 --> 00:07:58.644
Start by drawing expressions.

00:07:58.728 --> 00:08:01.606
As you go,
imagine what the characters look like.

00:08:01.689 --> 00:08:04.275
Once you can do that,
you'll be able to draw their faces.

00:08:04.901 --> 00:08:05.693
Mmm.

00:08:05.776 --> 00:08:06.903
Matmat.

00:08:08.196 --> 00:08:09.697
I know you can do it.

00:08:10.323 --> 00:08:12.742
You're talented, observant…

00:08:13.326 --> 00:08:14.744
But we have a deadline to work to.

00:08:15.119 --> 00:08:16.954
You must finish everything by next week.

00:08:18.539 --> 00:08:22.585
Next week? M-Mister Box
and friends need to have faces?

00:08:22.668 --> 00:08:24.504
Yes. You need to turn in the final draft.

00:08:26.422 --> 00:08:28.633
N-Next week.

00:08:28.716 --> 00:08:31.344
Deadline.

00:08:31.427 --> 00:08:32.553
Faces.

00:08:32.637 --> 00:08:35.640
Matmat can't draw them.

00:09:16.097 --> 00:09:17.098
Mister Samuel.

00:09:20.518 --> 00:09:22.895
You're the only one
who can tell me the truth.

00:09:25.731 --> 00:09:27.733
Is your wife still alive?

00:09:38.119 --> 00:09:39.287
Sir Samuel…

00:09:41.205 --> 00:09:43.374
This is for your daughter's sake.

00:09:45.126 --> 00:09:47.211
Is Ma'am Ingrid here in this hospital?

00:09:53.092 --> 00:09:54.343
Ingrid…?

00:09:57.471 --> 00:09:59.098
My wife?

00:09:59.181 --> 00:10:00.391
Yes.

00:10:02.685 --> 00:10:04.145
She's dead.

00:10:05.521 --> 00:10:06.939
My wife is dead.

00:10:07.023 --> 00:10:08.357
She can't…

00:10:08.858 --> 00:10:11.277
She can't. She can't.

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:13.279
She can't come back.

00:10:13.362 --> 00:10:15.072
She's dead--

00:10:15.156 --> 00:10:16.782
Sir Samuel! Sir Samuel!

00:10:19.994 --> 00:10:22.288
- What did you do?
- He suddenly…

00:10:23.664 --> 00:10:24.665
Come on.

00:10:26.083 --> 00:10:27.084
Samuel!

00:10:27.668 --> 00:10:29.879
Samuel, can you hear me?

00:10:29.962 --> 00:10:31.464
You're in the hospital.

00:10:31.547 --> 00:10:33.633
I can take care of him, Olivia.

00:10:55.905 --> 00:10:57.531
Patrick!

00:10:57.615 --> 00:10:58.699
How are you?

00:10:58.783 --> 00:11:00.701
I haven't seen you.

00:11:00.785 --> 00:11:01.786
I'm good.

00:11:02.536 --> 00:11:05.039
About the thing
you were asking me the other day.

00:11:05.623 --> 00:11:07.625
With Ma'am Ingrid and your mom.

00:11:09.001 --> 00:11:10.336
Is it okay now?

00:11:13.923 --> 00:11:15.341
Why do you ask?

00:11:17.593 --> 00:11:19.011
It's nothing.

00:11:19.095 --> 00:11:21.639
It's just that you looked worried.

00:11:24.016 --> 00:11:25.935
Don't worry. It's all good.

00:12:00.553 --> 00:12:02.763
Will those three find
what they're looking for?

00:12:02.847 --> 00:12:03.889
Hey!

00:12:04.306 --> 00:12:05.599
No reading.

00:12:05.683 --> 00:12:07.685
Neither of you won't
even share it with me.

00:12:07.768 --> 00:12:08.811
No.

00:12:08.894 --> 00:12:10.521
You have to wait until it's done.

00:12:10.604 --> 00:12:12.148
That’s too much of a suspense.

00:12:13.399 --> 00:12:15.901
Stay outside. I'm still writing.

00:12:16.902 --> 00:12:17.903
Go.

00:12:21.866 --> 00:12:24.910
You don't want to go?
Do you have anything to say?

00:12:24.994 --> 00:12:26.162
What is it?

00:12:26.662 --> 00:12:27.997
It's about,

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:29.290
Sir Samuel.

00:12:32.001 --> 00:12:33.544
He's in the isolation room again.

00:12:33.627 --> 00:12:35.087
His condition worsens, Mia.

00:12:35.171 --> 00:12:36.255
And so?

00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:37.756
Mia…

00:12:39.341 --> 00:12:41.886
Death can't undo what he did to me.

00:12:41.969 --> 00:12:43.471
- Mia--
- Go.

00:12:44.889 --> 00:12:47.141
I don't want you to have regrets.

00:12:48.893 --> 00:12:50.686
I said go, Patrick.

00:14:10.182 --> 00:14:11.642
Why are you still alive?!

00:14:11.725 --> 00:14:12.977
You should be dead!

00:14:13.686 --> 00:14:15.938
Sir Samuel! Sir Samuel, stop it!

00:14:18.274 --> 00:14:20.150
You are your mother's daughter.

00:14:20.693 --> 00:14:22.820
Her blood is your blood.

00:14:22.903 --> 00:14:25.447
Her character is your character.

00:14:25.531 --> 00:14:27.408
You can't run away from her.

00:14:28.742 --> 00:14:30.494
He's in
the isolation room again.

00:14:30.578 --> 00:14:32.454
His condition worsens, Mia.

00:14:32.538 --> 00:14:34.748
I don't want you to have regrets.

00:14:53.309 --> 00:14:54.560
Oh, Vincent.

00:14:54.643 --> 00:14:55.686
For you.

00:15:00.316 --> 00:15:03.569
Apologies. My friend just
returned from the farm in Benguet.

00:15:03.652 --> 00:15:05.070
That's why it took me a while.

00:15:07.239 --> 00:15:08.824
You shouldn't have bothered.

00:15:09.575 --> 00:15:11.785
You always tell me not to bother.

00:15:11.869 --> 00:15:14.204
But, I want to.

00:15:14.288 --> 00:15:15.831
I like doing things for you.

00:15:19.418 --> 00:15:23.005
I'm sorry I didn't
message you while I was in Manila.

00:15:24.715 --> 00:15:26.300
This is all Madeth's fault.

00:15:29.637 --> 00:15:30.804
Madeth?

00:15:31.221 --> 00:15:32.932
- Yeah.
- What did she do?

00:15:34.266 --> 00:15:37.061
I should not have
listened to her gut feeling.

00:15:37.144 --> 00:15:40.481
I should, listen to you alone.

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:44.777
Looks like you've contemplated
a lot while you were in Manila.

00:15:45.819 --> 00:15:48.113
All I did there was work.

00:15:48.197 --> 00:15:50.991
And my business dinner with Erica--

00:15:51.075 --> 00:15:52.368
We didn't even follow up on.

00:15:53.535 --> 00:15:54.912
And to be honest,

00:15:54.995 --> 00:15:58.123
I'm able to think more
sensibly here in Maravida.

00:15:58.624 --> 00:16:00.542
Hmm.

00:16:00.626 --> 00:16:04.254
I realized that,
I shouldn't be rushing into things.

00:16:05.172 --> 00:16:06.882
Patience is the key.

00:16:06.966 --> 00:16:08.884
Especially when it comes to the things

00:16:09.802 --> 00:16:10.970
I like.

00:16:18.018 --> 00:16:19.520
- I'll try this one.
- Yeah!

00:16:19.603 --> 00:16:21.605
- My mom might like coffee.
- Sure!

00:16:33.450 --> 00:16:34.451
Patrick.

00:16:35.744 --> 00:16:37.121
Ma'am Eden.

00:16:37.204 --> 00:16:38.831
Why did you lie?

00:16:39.581 --> 00:16:40.290
What?

00:16:40.374 --> 00:16:42.751
You said,
you didn't do anything to Samuel.

00:16:43.711 --> 00:16:46.588
But I saw on the CCTV
footage that you were talking to him.

00:16:46.922 --> 00:16:48.298
Ma'am--

00:16:48.382 --> 00:16:50.259
Do you want me
to report this to Dr. Anok?

00:16:50.342 --> 00:16:52.761
You've committed
countless offenses, Patrick.

00:16:53.178 --> 00:16:55.139
This is grounds for your termination.

00:16:55.222 --> 00:16:57.725
Ma'am, I didn't want
that to happen to Sir Samuel.

00:16:57.808 --> 00:16:59.143
What did you say to him anyway?

00:16:59.226 --> 00:17:00.811
For him to react that way?

00:17:03.897 --> 00:17:05.607
I asked him how he was doing.

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:08.277
I mentioned Mia's name.

00:17:09.528 --> 00:17:12.072
Is it bad to mention his daughter's name?

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:16.493
You shouldn't be doing things
that you're aren't ordered to do.

00:17:19.788 --> 00:17:23.250
You didn't even know that you were
ruining a patient's treatment.

00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:44.480
Hmm.

00:17:45.898 --> 00:17:47.858
Hmm.

00:17:51.612 --> 00:17:58.285
Matmat can't draw your face.

00:17:58.702 --> 00:18:00.704
Is that your sad face?

00:18:00.788 --> 00:18:02.831
Yes, Matmat. This is a sad face.

00:18:02.915 --> 00:18:04.792
Look at me. I was doing this.

00:18:05.375 --> 00:18:07.419
I'm sighing.

00:18:07.503 --> 00:18:10.130
And my eyes were
looking down. It was doing this.

00:18:10.214 --> 00:18:11.215
Right?

00:18:11.298 --> 00:18:13.884
Sad. That's sadness.

00:18:13.967 --> 00:18:17.638
That's hard.
Matmat is having a hard time.

00:18:17.721 --> 00:18:20.057
Alright, alright, Matmat.

00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:21.975
I'll give you another example of sadness.

00:18:22.059 --> 00:18:23.852
Let me give you one more. Um…

00:18:24.353 --> 00:18:26.313
Ahh…

00:18:26.396 --> 00:18:29.024
Okay, there's that sadness.

00:18:29.108 --> 00:18:31.819
This one is a different kind.
Here, hold on.

00:18:31.902 --> 00:18:33.821
Time to be an actor.

00:18:36.532 --> 00:18:40.035
Huh, huh…

00:18:40.119 --> 00:18:42.704
- Aww…
- Ugly, ugly!

00:18:42.788 --> 00:18:45.791
- That's now how to be sad.
- Wait, wait, Matmat!

00:18:45.874 --> 00:18:48.460
- It's a different kind!
- Hard. So hard.

00:18:48.544 --> 00:18:52.297
- No thanks, too hard!
- Hold on, hold on, Matmat!

00:18:52.381 --> 00:18:55.425
I have another kind of sadness.
It's a very different one.

00:18:55.509 --> 00:18:59.346
Let's pretend
that Gemma doesn't want to date me.

00:18:59.429 --> 00:19:03.100
- I'd be sad if she said no.
- Matmat? Matmat?

00:19:03.183 --> 00:19:05.853
Matmat, is that you? It is Matmat!

00:19:05.936 --> 00:19:08.105
I knew I heard you, Matmat.

00:19:09.439 --> 00:19:11.525
What's wrong Matmat?
Are you guys fighting?

00:19:11.942 --> 00:19:16.488
No, Matmat asked me
to help him with drawing expressions.

00:19:16.572 --> 00:19:18.365
He's practicing how to draw expressions.

00:19:18.448 --> 00:19:20.367
Drawing expressions? Matmat, that means

00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:22.452
- you guys need a model, right?
- Oh!

00:19:22.536 --> 00:19:24.204
I'm very expressive, Matmat.

00:19:24.288 --> 00:19:26.582
- I can be your model, Matmat.
- Oh, oh!

00:19:26.665 --> 00:19:29.209
- Look at me, Matmat!
- Wow!

00:19:29.293 --> 00:19:32.296
- Here's another pose, Matmat!
- Oh, wow!

00:19:32.379 --> 00:19:34.464
- Let me be your model, Matmat.
- Okay, okay.

00:19:34.548 --> 00:19:38.427
- M-Matmat will draw M-Madeth.
- Me? Really?

00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:40.387
Mm-hmm, that's me, Matmat.

00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:41.722
What do you need, Matmat?

00:19:43.557 --> 00:19:46.393
Happy. I need happy, Madeth.

00:19:46.476 --> 00:19:47.895
I can do that, Matmat!

00:19:47.978 --> 00:19:50.022
What kind of happy?
How happy do you want, Matmat?

00:19:50.105 --> 00:19:52.900
Happy like I just won the lottery?

00:19:54.568 --> 00:19:56.778
Or happy like
you just need an ID picture?

00:19:56.862 --> 00:19:58.405
One, two, three!

00:19:59.031 --> 00:20:00.574
- Ooh!
- Like that, Matmat?

00:20:00.657 --> 00:20:02.409
Or happy like my
crush finally noticed me?

00:20:21.303 --> 00:20:23.805
- I don't want to. Too hard.
- Oh.

00:20:23.889 --> 00:20:25.807
You don't want that, Matmat?
Hold on, Madeth.

00:20:25.891 --> 00:20:27.351
Didn't like hers? It was good!

00:20:27.434 --> 00:20:30.020
Like the one who won the lottery,
draw that one!

00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:35.150
Oh, oh no! Madeth, what was that?

00:20:35.234 --> 00:20:36.610
Why are you feeling this way.

00:20:36.693 --> 00:20:39.613
Why would you say that?
Noticed by your crush?

00:20:39.696 --> 00:20:42.866
What did my crush notice?
What is it, Madeth?

00:20:45.369 --> 00:20:47.704
So, I'm the one you want to drink with?

00:20:59.049 --> 00:21:00.842
Is this about your papa?

00:21:04.221 --> 00:21:05.555
Gemma.

00:21:06.223 --> 00:21:08.642
What if we were switched at birth?

00:21:11.687 --> 00:21:16.400
What if Miss Li was my mama,
and you had my papa?

00:21:19.987 --> 00:21:22.114
- Mia…
- What would happen?

00:21:24.157 --> 00:21:25.158
Come on.

00:21:26.159 --> 00:21:27.619
It's just a "what if."

00:21:30.539 --> 00:21:35.043
If it was like that,
and you were mama's daughter…

00:21:36.712 --> 00:21:39.381
She'd pinch your inner
thigh for talking like that.

00:21:41.008 --> 00:21:43.093
That's true.

00:21:45.554 --> 00:21:47.055
As for you…

00:21:49.099 --> 00:21:54.688
My parents would be so
happy having a nice daughter like you.

00:21:57.607 --> 00:21:59.693
Someone who would be afraid of them.

00:22:00.777 --> 00:22:02.112
Afraid?

00:22:03.113 --> 00:22:04.823
You're afraid of your papa?

00:22:06.867 --> 00:22:07.951
I'm afraid of my mama.

00:22:11.413 --> 00:22:14.958
That's why I tried to be
a good daughter growing up.

00:22:18.462 --> 00:22:19.963
Because I was afraid of her.

00:22:22.758 --> 00:22:24.384
Mama?

00:22:25.093 --> 00:22:27.429
Mama, I'm hungry.

00:22:27.512 --> 00:22:29.473
Aren't we going to eat dinner?

00:22:30.015 --> 00:22:31.308
You're disturbing me!

00:22:31.767 --> 00:22:35.979
Didn't I tell you to not
disturb me while I'm writing?

00:23:08.512 --> 00:23:10.680
I just didn't want her to hate me.

00:23:12.641 --> 00:23:16.103
I used to think she was
the only one that liked me.

00:23:20.941 --> 00:23:22.442
Until I met him.

00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:28.573
I wanted to go with him…

00:23:29.699 --> 00:23:32.452
so that I didn't
need to live life in fear.

00:23:33.745 --> 00:23:35.205
But those plans…

00:23:36.581 --> 00:23:38.750
were thwarted by her.

00:23:44.214 --> 00:23:48.051
You're so luck to have
a supportive mother like Miss Li.

00:23:56.351 --> 00:23:58.687
As for my papa,

00:23:59.896 --> 00:24:01.606
I'm not afraid of him.

00:24:03.775 --> 00:24:04.860
I just…

00:24:06.027 --> 00:24:09.072
never felt his presence. Never.

00:24:10.282 --> 00:24:11.783
He was just there.

00:24:14.369 --> 00:24:16.496
He didn't do anything for you?

00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:18.331
Like what?

00:24:19.624 --> 00:24:22.961
Try to protect me
from the cruel ways of my mother?

00:24:24.462 --> 00:24:26.006
He didn't do anything.

00:24:29.676 --> 00:24:30.927
Wait…

00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:33.722
There was one thing.

00:24:36.016 --> 00:24:37.809
He read me a fairytale.

00:24:39.895 --> 00:24:41.188
That's it?

00:24:42.772 --> 00:24:45.734
Yeah, just once.

00:24:47.194 --> 00:24:48.445
Nothing more.

00:25:45.627 --> 00:25:47.545
Do you want a drink of water?

00:25:50.173 --> 00:25:51.633
I want to…

00:25:53.843 --> 00:25:56.388
I want to tell the truth.

00:26:02.143 --> 00:26:03.478
What's the truth?

00:26:04.813 --> 00:26:06.398
I did…

00:26:08.441 --> 00:26:10.402
…something bad.

00:26:14.739 --> 00:26:16.700
Don't think too hard, Samuel.

00:26:18.952 --> 00:26:20.495
I killed her.

00:26:22.163 --> 00:26:23.873
I killed my wife.

00:26:38.471 --> 00:26:41.266
You two are mine and mine alone.

00:26:41.349 --> 00:26:42.892
I killed her.

00:26:42.976 --> 00:26:46.229
There are only two people
in this hospital that could be Ingrid.

00:26:46.313 --> 00:26:49.232
They're the two people
who are connected to Mia's papa.

00:26:49.316 --> 00:26:52.819
Mia saw how I killed my wife!

00:26:52.902 --> 00:26:54.362
Is that why you strangled Mia?

00:26:54.446 --> 00:26:57.949
No matter what I discover,
I'll get you out, Mia.

00:26:58.033 --> 00:27:00.910
Do you know where Mia is?
Mister Samuel is missing.
