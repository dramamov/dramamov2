WEBVTT

00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:13.000
Enlightening the masses,

00:00:13.083 --> 00:00:14.375
unhindered in his deeds

00:00:14.458 --> 00:00:16.541
Homage to the holy sages

00:00:16.625 --> 00:00:20.166
Homage to the
Western Pure Land of Ultimate Bliss

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.583
This represents
the immeasurable virtues of the Pure Land

00:00:25.666 --> 00:00:31.041
Homage to Amitabha Buddha,
whose very name embodies his being

00:00:33.416 --> 00:00:34.666
I'm sorry.

00:00:36.875 --> 00:00:38.291
Amitabha Buddha.

00:00:42.125 --> 00:00:43.833
Come in and have a seat.

00:00:43.916 --> 00:00:44.750
No, thanks.

00:00:45.666 --> 00:00:47.000
I can't really stay.

00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:54.083
FUNERAL OFFERING

00:00:54.166 --> 00:00:55.166
My condolences.

00:00:56.458 --> 00:00:57.291
It must be hard.

00:00:58.708 --> 00:00:59.666
Where's An Chi?

00:01:00.375 --> 00:01:03.041
Something came up at school.
She couldn't make it.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.916
She won't even see Hsin-yi off?

00:01:07.416 --> 00:01:09.291
I'm here on her behalf, right?

00:01:12.083 --> 00:01:13.833
Sorry. I have a prenatal check-up.

00:01:13.916 --> 00:01:15.000
I have to go.

00:01:59.333 --> 00:02:00.541
What are you doing here?

00:02:01.416 --> 00:02:03.541
This is the document
you asked me to sign.

00:02:05.166 --> 00:02:07.666
You could've sent it.
No need to come yourself.

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:08.708
Thank you.

00:02:09.375 --> 00:02:10.958
Won't you invite me up?

00:02:11.625 --> 00:02:13.541
I just came back to grab something.

00:02:13.625 --> 00:02:15.166
Is An Chi home?

00:02:17.916 --> 00:02:19.583
Is that why you came here?

00:02:19.666 --> 00:02:22.458
I really don't understand
what you want with her.

00:02:22.541 --> 00:02:25.208
She told the police everything.
You saw that.

00:02:25.291 --> 00:02:29.250
But her statement didn't explain
why Hsin-yi was tortured to death

00:02:29.333 --> 00:02:31.416
or why Jin Jin is in a coma.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:32.916
Because she doesn't know.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.416
They lived in the same complex
for half a year.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.125
Surely she knows something?

00:02:37.208 --> 00:02:40.375
Any detail
could be related to Hsin-yi's death.

00:02:40.458 --> 00:02:42.291
Actually, An Chi's gone to the US.

00:02:43.083 --> 00:02:44.833
She's had a hard time emotionally.

00:02:44.916 --> 00:02:46.083
I sent her to get help.

00:02:46.166 --> 00:02:47.625
Her dad's gone with her.

00:02:47.708 --> 00:02:48.791
When was this?

00:02:49.791 --> 00:02:51.000
Last week.

00:02:52.875 --> 00:02:53.875
Huang I-chen.

00:02:55.125 --> 00:02:56.583
What are you hiding from me?

00:02:57.458 --> 00:02:59.000
What have I got to hide?

00:03:00.625 --> 00:03:02.208
I honestly don't understand.

00:03:02.291 --> 00:03:04.083
Can't you just leave An Chi alone?

00:03:04.166 --> 00:03:06.458
Let her be.
She was a victim just like Hsin-yi.

00:03:06.541 --> 00:03:08.041
Leave her alone.

00:04:12.208 --> 00:04:14.041
05 INVESTIGATION NIGHT

00:04:14.125 --> 00:04:15.791
This is a real-life case.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.250
An assailant indiscriminately attacked

00:04:19.333 --> 00:04:21.208
passengers on the MRT.

00:04:21.291 --> 00:04:24.708
The assailant was a young man
weighing less than 60 kg.

00:04:24.791 --> 00:04:28.666
And there were over 70 passengers
in the two carriages at the time.

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.916
But not one of them tried to stop him.

00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:34.833
This is a photo of the crime scene.

00:04:35.708 --> 00:04:37.333
I'd like to pose a question.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.958
Imagine this.

00:04:39.041 --> 00:04:41.458
If you were in this carriage that day,

00:04:42.541 --> 00:04:44.833
would you have tried
to subdue the assailant?

00:04:44.916 --> 00:04:46.500
Or, at a time like that,

00:04:46.583 --> 00:04:49.041
would it be wiser to keep your distance

00:04:49.125 --> 00:04:50.791
and protect yourself?

00:04:51.708 --> 00:04:54.708
Either way,
if that was me before I turned 17,

00:04:54.791 --> 00:04:56.625
I would have chosen the latter.

00:05:03.583 --> 00:05:05.333
But when I was 17,

00:05:06.625 --> 00:05:07.916
my life

00:05:08.708 --> 00:05:10.166
took a drastic turn.

00:05:11.416 --> 00:05:12.625
I was kidnapped.

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:21.375
As a victim and survivor
of a major telecom scam in Southeast Asia,

00:05:21.458 --> 00:05:23.125
I realized one thing.

00:05:23.208 --> 00:05:26.458
Silence and obedience
only encourage evil.

00:05:28.583 --> 00:05:30.041
So we started resisting,

00:05:30.125 --> 00:05:30.958
trying to escape

00:05:31.541 --> 00:05:33.083
and contact the outside world.

00:05:33.875 --> 00:05:37.000
Even though we kept failing,
and were repeatedly punished

00:05:37.083 --> 00:05:39.166
and beaten after we were caughtâ€¦

00:05:39.916 --> 00:05:41.125
Even though in the end,

00:05:41.833 --> 00:05:43.125
my best friend

00:05:44.666 --> 00:05:46.291
lost her life...

00:05:56.458 --> 00:05:59.291
...this seemingly unwise choice

00:05:59.375 --> 00:06:02.250
actually formed an invisible force.

00:06:02.333 --> 00:06:04.916
It was this force
that kept me motivated,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.291
giving me the opportunities and courage

00:06:07.375 --> 00:06:10.041
to seek help during a visit to the bank.

00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:13.583
Although it was a small move,

00:06:13.666 --> 00:06:16.541
it gave the police a clue
and an opportunity

00:06:16.625 --> 00:06:19.000
that led
to the destruction of the notorious

00:06:19.083 --> 00:06:20.875
Southeast Asian crime syndicate.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.083
Because of that,
I am able to stand here

00:06:24.166 --> 00:06:25.958
and talk about my topic today,

00:06:26.416 --> 00:06:28.791
"Be Brave or Be Wise".

00:06:28.875 --> 00:06:30.458
Being wise isn't wrong.

00:06:30.541 --> 00:06:33.000
It's just that this world
needs more brave people.

00:06:33.916 --> 00:06:34.916
Thank you.

00:06:55.875 --> 00:06:57.666
CONGRATULATIONS ON THE PROMOTION

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:00.666
WELL DONE AN CHI
FOR GETTING INTO YALE LAW SCHOOL

00:07:06.875 --> 00:07:07.916
Congratulations.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.666
You finally won the case.
He got the death penalty.

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:12.333
Hardly something to celebrate.

00:07:21.208 --> 00:07:22.500
Where's Ms Huang?

00:07:22.583 --> 00:07:24.333
She got promoted and moved offices.

00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:35.916
An Chi's such a talent.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.708
- Thanks.
- I mean, Yale Law School.

00:07:37.791 --> 00:07:38.875
I know.

00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:41.458
- Apologies. Sorry I'm late.
- It's okay.

00:07:41.541 --> 00:07:43.416
- Where's I-chen?
- She changed offices.

00:07:44.166 --> 00:07:45.916
Your clients are here.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.416
- I'd better get to work. Thank you.
- Okay.

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:51.708
This way, please.

00:07:55.458 --> 00:07:56.458
In my office.

00:07:58.791 --> 00:08:00.166
THREE MOTHERS' BATTLE

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:01.958
We won the case, right?

00:08:02.041 --> 00:08:04.291
They want to publish our autobiographies.

00:08:04.375 --> 00:08:06.625
Don't worry, they'll find ghostwriters.

00:08:08.291 --> 00:08:09.958
Write what, exactly?

00:08:10.041 --> 00:08:12.750
Write what happened,
your experiences and the like.

00:08:12.833 --> 00:08:15.833
Wasn't that already covered in the news?

00:08:15.916 --> 00:08:16.958
Yes.

00:08:17.041 --> 00:08:19.500
But there are lots of details
people don't know.

00:08:19.583 --> 00:08:20.500
Like what?

00:08:22.041 --> 00:08:23.125
For example,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.583
how An Chi alerted the police.

00:08:25.666 --> 00:08:26.500
And Jin Jin.

00:08:26.583 --> 00:08:29.833
The syndicate
was using her travel vlog as a tool.

00:08:29.916 --> 00:08:32.625
And how Hsin-yi brought up her late dad

00:08:32.708 --> 00:08:36.208
to alert you.
I think these details are important.

00:08:36.291 --> 00:08:37.791
That's all private, no?

00:08:39.541 --> 00:08:40.666
Sure it is.

00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:43.375
But without these exclusive details,

00:08:43.458 --> 00:08:45.000
no one would buy the book.

00:08:45.083 --> 00:08:47.291
Sounds like exploiting our own children.

00:08:47.875 --> 00:08:49.791
My daughter was a victim too.

00:08:50.208 --> 00:08:51.750
If I saw it as exploitation,

00:08:51.833 --> 00:08:53.083
would I have agreed?

00:08:53.541 --> 00:08:55.791
Hui-chun. You know me.

00:08:55.875 --> 00:08:58.333
You livestream daily
to raise money for Jin Jin.

00:08:58.416 --> 00:08:59.958
Is that exploiting her?

00:09:00.041 --> 00:09:01.750
That's different, okay?

00:09:03.666 --> 00:09:06.791
Look, I'm not doing this for myself.

00:09:07.375 --> 00:09:09.125
If we can publish this book,

00:09:09.208 --> 00:09:10.833
it will be of value to society

00:09:10.916 --> 00:09:13.791
and the royalties
will help ease your financial burdens.

00:09:13.875 --> 00:09:15.666
I promise I'll vet the content.

00:09:16.625 --> 00:09:18.458
Just give me an hour-long interview.

00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:22.666
Can I have an hour with An Chi?

00:09:23.375 --> 00:09:24.875
She's going to Yale.

00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:26.708
How bad can her mental state be?

00:09:26.791 --> 00:09:30.291
I remember she used to be into music.

00:09:30.375 --> 00:09:31.791
When did law become a thing?

00:09:31.875 --> 00:09:33.500
What are you two implying?

00:09:33.583 --> 00:09:35.750
After such a terrifying experience,

00:09:35.833 --> 00:09:37.708
it's normal that she would change.

00:09:37.791 --> 00:09:40.083
Was it her choice, or did you force her?

00:09:40.166 --> 00:09:41.375
Aren't you happy for her?

00:09:41.458 --> 00:09:44.125
She suffered so much
and still managed to alert the police.

00:09:44.208 --> 00:09:46.875
Can you imagine
how much pressure she was under?

00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:49.083
Of course.
So why are you pressuring her--

00:09:49.166 --> 00:09:50.875
How am I pressuring her?

00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:54.583
Come on. We're all happy
she got into college, okay?

00:09:54.666 --> 00:09:56.708
But we'll need time to think about

00:09:57.208 --> 00:09:58.333
publishing this book.

00:09:58.416 --> 00:09:59.416
Forget it.

00:10:00.458 --> 00:10:01.583
Take your time.

00:10:02.583 --> 00:10:04.333
It's not me that needs the money.

00:10:07.208 --> 00:10:08.541
I want the best for you.

00:10:15.875 --> 00:10:17.500
If that's really what you want,

00:10:17.583 --> 00:10:20.000
then spend more time on the civil damages

00:10:20.083 --> 00:10:21.666
rather than this nonsense.

00:10:43.333 --> 00:10:46.125
She kept An Chi
hidden away from everything before,

00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:50.833
saying she didn't want
her daughter to have to relive it all.

00:10:51.416 --> 00:10:52.625
Now the case is over,

00:10:52.708 --> 00:10:55.583
she lets her go on TV every day
and play the victim.

00:10:55.666 --> 00:10:57.583
Why isn't she worried about her now?

00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:06.541
Today's the last day of
the Youth Elite Forum.

00:11:06.625 --> 00:11:09.000
Another round of applause
for everyone on stage.

00:11:32.125 --> 00:11:33.916
Hello, could we interview you?

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.125
I'm sorry.

00:11:37.791 --> 00:11:38.791
Congratulations.

00:11:38.875 --> 00:11:39.916
Ms. Wang.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.291
Thank you.

00:11:41.375 --> 00:11:42.916
Can I treat you to dinner?

00:11:43.375 --> 00:11:45.166
Ms. Wang, I have work to do.

00:11:45.625 --> 00:11:46.958
Let's have a chat then.

00:11:47.791 --> 00:11:49.458
Over there. Come on.

00:11:50.041 --> 00:11:51.958
I haven't seen you for a long time.

00:11:57.666 --> 00:11:59.500
You got into such a good college.

00:11:59.583 --> 00:12:01.541
You must have studied really hard.

00:12:02.833 --> 00:12:03.750
It wasn't so bad.

00:12:04.333 --> 00:12:06.000
Nowadays, famous US schools

00:12:06.083 --> 00:12:08.416
want unique and versatile students.

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:10.833
Like getting into law school,

00:12:10.916 --> 00:12:13.541
I just had to show
what sets me apart from others.

00:12:14.625 --> 00:12:15.875
And what sets you apart?

00:12:19.625 --> 00:12:21.041
That's not what I meant.

00:12:21.125 --> 00:12:23.250
I've always thought you were exceptional.

00:12:23.833 --> 00:12:26.125
Jin Jin always spoke highly of you.

00:12:27.833 --> 00:12:29.750
I found this.

00:12:30.291 --> 00:12:32.250
Since you're going to the US,

00:12:32.833 --> 00:12:34.208
think of it as a memento.

00:12:43.791 --> 00:12:47.375
Actually, I came today
to congratulate you on Jin Jin's behalf.

00:12:48.166 --> 00:12:50.791
She always said you were her best friend.

00:12:55.875 --> 00:12:57.250
One day, she bought

00:12:57.333 --> 00:12:58.916
a bunch of sunflowers home.

00:12:59.833 --> 00:13:01.583
I thought they were for me.

00:13:02.083 --> 00:13:03.250
But she said, "No.

00:13:03.333 --> 00:13:06.000
Tomorrow is An Chi's birthday,
they're for her."

00:13:06.083 --> 00:13:07.833
I was a little disappointed.

00:13:18.708 --> 00:13:20.708
You got into such a good school.

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:24.125
You're going to have a brilliant future.

00:13:25.666 --> 00:13:27.625
Both Jin Jin and Hsin-yi

00:13:28.458 --> 00:13:30.500
would be so happy for you.

00:13:33.625 --> 00:13:35.583
If Jin Jin and Hsin-yi were still alive,

00:13:36.666 --> 00:13:39.166
I know they'd be
pursuing their own dreams too.

00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:40.791
Jin Jin is still alive.

00:13:43.625 --> 00:13:46.041
Or do you think she's as good as dead?

00:13:48.708 --> 00:13:50.250
Ms. Wang, I didn't mean that.

00:13:52.125 --> 00:13:53.541
I know you didn't mean that.

00:13:56.708 --> 00:13:58.791
Ms. Wang, the lights are out. Let's go.

00:14:00.291 --> 00:14:02.125
I keep forgetting to say

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.208
thank you.

00:14:04.791 --> 00:14:06.541
Jin Jin only made it back alive,

00:14:06.625 --> 00:14:08.958
because of your bravery in
alerting the police.

00:14:13.791 --> 00:14:14.625
An Chi.

00:14:20.208 --> 00:14:21.250
You forgot this.

00:14:22.875 --> 00:14:24.541
Ms. Wang, thanks for the flowers,

00:14:24.625 --> 00:14:26.875
but you should keep Jin Jin's things.

00:14:50.166 --> 00:14:53.375
ONE MOTHER'S BATTLE

00:15:07.375 --> 00:15:08.208
Eat.

00:15:09.083 --> 00:15:11.041
If you don't eat, you'll starve.

00:15:14.583 --> 00:15:16.875
Do you want me to get out of this alive?

00:15:20.708 --> 00:15:22.625
Die and you'll never see your daughter.

00:15:27.541 --> 00:15:28.958
You didn't know?

00:15:36.666 --> 00:15:37.541
Hello?

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.083
Are you here now?

00:15:39.708 --> 00:15:40.541
We're here.

00:15:41.125 --> 00:15:43.416
Can you tell me
what exactly you are up to?

00:15:44.541 --> 00:15:45.708
Put An Chi on.

00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:48.041
You can say it to me.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.083
I repeat.

00:15:50.708 --> 00:15:52.125
Put An Chi on.

00:15:54.875 --> 00:15:56.041
Hello, Ms. Chao?

00:15:56.625 --> 00:15:57.666
An Chi.

00:15:58.708 --> 00:16:01.666
Okay. Just making sure you're here.

00:16:02.083 --> 00:16:03.125
See you soon.

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:20.333
Give me some.

00:16:52.208 --> 00:16:53.041
Eason.

00:16:55.333 --> 00:16:56.333
What do you think?

00:16:57.291 --> 00:16:58.291
Beautiful.

00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:12.166
Do you like it?

00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:13.333
Yes.

00:17:14.708 --> 00:17:17.166
But that's okay.
I've got lots of similar outfits.

00:17:18.125 --> 00:17:19.125
It's on me.

00:17:21.833 --> 00:17:23.916
No need, it's not like I can't afford it.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.416
I've already paid.

00:17:27.708 --> 00:17:29.750
These shoes match your dress.

00:17:30.625 --> 00:17:31.833
Your card, thank you.

00:17:31.916 --> 00:17:33.416
- I want these too.
- Okay, yes.

00:17:40.708 --> 00:17:43.416
You don't have to do this.
It's embarrassing.

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:44.791
It's fine.

00:17:44.875 --> 00:17:45.708
By the way,

00:17:46.666 --> 00:17:48.166
I'd like to ask a favor.

00:17:48.625 --> 00:17:49.750
Go somewhere with me?

00:17:49.833 --> 00:17:51.250
You'll need to dress up.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.000
Have a look.

00:17:57.583 --> 00:18:00.000
It's the info we compiled
on the association.

00:18:00.083 --> 00:18:02.083
I had my suspicions before.

00:18:02.166 --> 00:18:04.750
But their accounts were so clean.

00:18:04.833 --> 00:18:06.500
Completely airtight.

00:18:06.583 --> 00:18:10.000
Now that we know they're
using cryptocurrency to launder money,

00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:12.125
we should change tactics.

00:18:12.208 --> 00:18:15.750
I've asked my colleagues
to look for evidence.

00:18:15.833 --> 00:18:19.166
I've even hired a cryptocurrency expert

00:18:19.250 --> 00:18:20.458
as our consultant.

00:18:20.541 --> 00:18:21.416
Don't worry.

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:23.458
I've called in every favor this time.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.416
I'll do my best
to present evidence to the court

00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:27.791
and sue for civil damages.

00:18:28.666 --> 00:18:29.916
- Okay?
- Okay.

00:18:30.666 --> 00:18:33.541
So you mean
you weren't doing your best before?

00:18:37.458 --> 00:18:40.125
What I mean is, as your lawyer,

00:18:41.333 --> 00:18:43.000
I hope that from now on,

00:18:43.625 --> 00:18:45.958
we won't hide anything from each other.

00:18:46.041 --> 00:18:47.291
Okay?

00:18:47.375 --> 00:18:50.166
We never hid anything from you.

00:18:52.708 --> 00:18:53.833
Alright.

00:18:53.916 --> 00:18:55.500
So we can trust each other.

00:18:57.208 --> 00:18:58.500
Then can you tell me

00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:01.083
why Chang Shih-kai is alive?

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.375
What did you do to him?

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.041
We found a village in the countryside here

00:19:15.125 --> 00:19:17.041
where villagers worship a goddess.

00:19:17.625 --> 00:19:20.833
This goddess uses witchcraft
to resurrect people.

00:19:20.916 --> 00:19:24.375
So we paid the cops
to get us Chang Shih-kai's corpse,

00:19:24.458 --> 00:19:27.458
then got the goddess to breathe on him.

00:19:31.041 --> 00:19:32.375
And he came back to life.

00:19:35.666 --> 00:19:36.791
It's true.

00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:46.750
Forget it.

00:19:48.041 --> 00:19:49.500
You still don't trust me.

00:19:50.416 --> 00:19:51.416
Never mind.

00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:53.041
But I must remind you.

00:19:53.125 --> 00:19:54.916
Chang Shih-kai was on death row.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.041
I don't care
if you bought off the guards or whatever,

00:19:58.125 --> 00:20:00.041
do you know how serious a crime it is

00:20:01.583 --> 00:20:03.375
sneaking him out of prison?

00:20:03.458 --> 00:20:04.625
Don't worry.

00:20:04.708 --> 00:20:06.791
We'll handle Chang Shih-kai.

00:20:06.875 --> 00:20:09.166
We won't drag you
or An Chi down with us.

00:20:13.791 --> 00:20:14.916
Then why did you

00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:17.583
take photos of my daughter?

00:20:19.083 --> 00:20:20.500
Sure she's your daughter?

00:20:30.583 --> 00:20:31.583
I confess.

00:20:34.166 --> 00:20:35.625
She's An Chi's daughter.

00:20:38.791 --> 00:20:40.375
Why didn't you tell us?

00:20:40.458 --> 00:20:42.000
Because she's Chang Shih-kai's.

00:20:42.625 --> 00:20:44.333
He raped An Chi.

00:20:44.916 --> 00:20:47.500
I didn't tell you
because I wanted to protect her.

00:20:48.083 --> 00:20:49.250
Was that wrong?

00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:57.791
We asked you here

00:20:57.875 --> 00:21:01.833
to help us find evidence
that Sanching Tai Chi is laundering money.

00:21:01.916 --> 00:21:03.500
You didn't have to threaten me.

00:21:03.583 --> 00:21:06.250
Would you have come if we didn't?

00:21:06.833 --> 00:21:08.833
You said to go our separate ways

00:21:08.916 --> 00:21:10.291
and not contact you again.

00:21:10.875 --> 00:21:12.250
Have you forgotten?

00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:15.375
I felt cornered.

00:21:17.666 --> 00:21:19.208
Okay, I promise.

00:21:19.791 --> 00:21:22.500
- I will do my best to help you.
- I believe in you.

00:21:22.583 --> 00:21:24.541
But before we get to the bottom of it,

00:21:24.625 --> 00:21:26.708
you and An Chi must stay here.

00:21:28.791 --> 00:21:30.333
Why must An Chi stay here?

00:21:30.416 --> 00:21:32.666
She's going to the US and has to do--

00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:34.458
So hurry up.

00:21:34.541 --> 00:21:35.833
No, I can stay here.

00:21:35.916 --> 00:21:37.666
My entire team can come here.

00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:38.750
But An Chi must go.

00:21:38.833 --> 00:21:40.208
- She's got to go to--
- Mom.

00:21:41.416 --> 00:21:43.375
Can I talk with them in private?

00:21:43.916 --> 00:21:45.458
Why wouldn't you want me here?

00:21:48.083 --> 00:21:49.791
I thought we trusted each other.

00:21:50.416 --> 00:21:51.791
What are you afraid of?

00:22:01.041 --> 00:22:02.250
I'll wait outside.

00:22:12.875 --> 00:22:14.625
Can I see Chang Shih-kai?

00:22:14.708 --> 00:22:15.708
What?

00:22:17.333 --> 00:22:19.416
Wouldn't seeing him bring back--

00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:21.750
I want to know if he's really alive.

00:22:24.458 --> 00:22:26.291
Why did you keep the child?

00:22:30.625 --> 00:22:32.375
I've thought about it a lot.

00:22:35.166 --> 00:22:36.875
Of course I know who the dad is.

00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:41.416
But for some reason,

00:22:42.916 --> 00:22:44.958
I just felt I had to keep the baby.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:48.750
After all, the baby is innocent.

00:22:49.958 --> 00:22:52.083
Can't have been easy persuading your mom.

00:22:58.541 --> 00:22:59.541
I forced her.

00:23:00.666 --> 00:23:03.458
But I have to tell other people
she's my sister.

00:23:04.416 --> 00:23:06.125
She doesn't want my future ruined.

00:23:25.458 --> 00:23:26.916
Do you want a book?

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.000
Want a book?

00:23:28.666 --> 00:23:29.625
Thank you.

00:23:29.708 --> 00:23:31.333
Have a great day.

00:23:31.416 --> 00:23:32.416
Christina.

00:23:44.291 --> 00:23:46.500
Why didn't you visit Nana
when you got back?

00:23:46.583 --> 00:23:47.875
Why did you come here?

00:23:50.166 --> 00:23:51.875
Hello, I'm Christina.

00:23:55.291 --> 00:23:59.125
I came here
to pick a gift for your fiancÃ©e.

00:23:59.208 --> 00:24:00.833
Mom, let me introduce you.

00:24:00.916 --> 00:24:02.708
This is Christina. She's my--

00:24:02.791 --> 00:24:03.791
Hey.

00:24:03.875 --> 00:24:06.000
What do you think
of this pair of bangles?

00:24:06.083 --> 00:24:08.208
Wouldn't they suit Lisa perfectly?

00:24:08.291 --> 00:24:10.041
I plan on buying them,

00:24:10.125 --> 00:24:11.750
one for me and one for her.

00:24:11.833 --> 00:24:13.208
I'm sorry.

00:24:13.291 --> 00:24:14.125
It's fine.

00:24:14.208 --> 00:24:15.875
Mom, let me introduce you again.

00:24:15.958 --> 00:24:17.000
This is Christina.

00:24:17.083 --> 00:24:18.333
She's my girlfriend.

00:24:19.208 --> 00:24:21.416
I brought her to meet you today.

00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:23.125
I'm not in love with Lisa.

00:24:28.375 --> 00:24:30.083
Don't worry.

00:24:30.166 --> 00:24:31.791
Lisa doesn't love you either.

00:24:31.875 --> 00:24:34.500
Love and marriage are separate matters.

00:24:34.583 --> 00:24:37.000
You know very well
why you must marry her.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:39.083
Mom, listen to me.

00:24:40.125 --> 00:24:43.250
I want to marry the one I truly love.

00:24:43.333 --> 00:24:44.708
That will make me happy.

00:24:50.375 --> 00:24:52.083
You'll be happy, but I won't.

00:24:54.375 --> 00:24:56.458
Family influence and wealth are the only--

00:24:56.541 --> 00:24:57.875
I'm sorry.

00:24:57.958 --> 00:24:59.208
Mom, wait for me.

00:24:59.291 --> 00:25:02.750
She looks so poor.
Lord knows where you met her.

00:25:02.833 --> 00:25:04.041
Mom, lower your voice.

00:25:04.958 --> 00:25:08.541
All right, ladies and gentlemen.
Then, at 950,000 US dollars,

00:25:08.625 --> 00:25:09.791
going onceâ€¦

00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:11.333
Are you okay?

00:25:11.416 --> 00:25:13.000
Going twiceâ€¦

00:25:14.333 --> 00:25:17.791
And the bid is sold to the gentleman
at 950,000 US dollars.

00:25:17.875 --> 00:25:19.041
Congratulations.

00:25:21.958 --> 00:25:25.958
And the next item,
we have a pair of sun green jade bangles.

00:25:26.041 --> 00:25:27.875
This is a very rare variety

00:25:27.958 --> 00:25:30.458
with a green ribbon-like strap inside.

00:25:30.541 --> 00:25:33.833
It has abundant water content
and excellent transparency.

00:25:33.916 --> 00:25:36.375
The overall appearance
of these bracelets--

00:25:36.458 --> 00:25:38.041
This is the one.

00:25:38.125 --> 00:25:39.541
Let's bid.

00:25:39.625 --> 00:25:43.541

Thank you, madam.
We have 600,000 US dollars.

Thank you, madam.
We have 650. Let's try for 700.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.208
Anyone in this room?

00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:37.541
All right. Then, at 650,000 US dollars,

00:26:38.708 --> 00:26:39.750
going onceâ€¦

00:26:47.166 --> 00:26:48.416
...going twiceâ€¦

00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:56.166
Thank you very much.

at 700,000 US dollars. Congratulations.

00:27:19.125 --> 00:27:20.291
Hello, ma'am.

00:27:20.375 --> 00:27:22.500
Those bangles are my gift to you.

00:27:22.583 --> 00:27:25.250
Christina Chang.
My father does business in Fujian.

00:27:25.833 --> 00:27:26.916
Nice to meet you.

00:27:36.291 --> 00:27:37.125
Eason.

00:27:37.208 --> 00:27:38.958
Arrange a dinner engagement.

00:27:39.041 --> 00:27:40.708
I'd like to get to know her.

00:27:42.166 --> 00:27:43.000
Okay.

00:28:00.333 --> 00:28:01.333
I'll pay.

00:28:01.416 --> 00:28:03.208
You shouldn't have to pay for them.

00:28:06.625 --> 00:28:09.166
But my mom said she's really pleased.

00:28:10.416 --> 00:28:12.375
She never likes anyone this much.

00:28:14.625 --> 00:28:16.291
It's okay, it's not that much.

00:28:16.375 --> 00:28:19.416
And I'm happy to help you
stand up to her.

00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:20.875
I hate overbearing mothers.

00:28:21.958 --> 00:28:24.958
Even if I'm not your real girlfriend.

00:28:26.375 --> 00:28:28.125
I wish that all of this was real

00:28:29.166 --> 00:28:30.500
and you were my girlfriend.

00:28:35.333 --> 00:28:37.208
I've got to find my mom.

00:28:37.291 --> 00:28:39.166
I'm taking her to visit Grandma.

00:28:39.250 --> 00:28:41.458
I'll contact you later.

00:28:41.541 --> 00:28:42.958
Sure, it's okay, go.

00:28:59.708 --> 00:29:00.916
I'll see you later.

00:29:06.041 --> 00:29:07.541
Excuse me, madam.

00:29:09.125 --> 00:29:10.625
Sorry, excuse me, madam.

00:29:10.708 --> 00:29:12.125
You can check again, please.

00:29:13.708 --> 00:29:15.166
Here is your document, madam.

00:29:16.375 --> 00:29:18.166
Please transfer the remaining money

00:29:18.250 --> 00:29:20.625
into the designated account
within seven days.

00:29:20.708 --> 00:29:23.833
Otherwise, this item
will be considered out of auction.

00:29:23.916 --> 00:29:27.791
And please be reminded
your deposit will not be returned.

00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:45.625
How did I do?
Was my acting believable?

00:29:53.541 --> 00:29:54.375
No.

00:30:00.666 --> 00:30:02.166
You're too young.

00:30:02.250 --> 00:30:04.041
You look nothing like my mom.

00:30:26.250 --> 00:30:29.333
You promised to spend next month with me.

00:30:30.791 --> 00:30:31.625
Sure.

00:31:22.166 --> 00:31:23.333
It's been a while.

00:31:24.791 --> 00:31:27.250
GPS TRACKING FAILED

00:31:54.875 --> 00:31:56.291
Does the child look like me?

00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:03.208
She's not your child.

00:32:04.416 --> 00:32:05.708
She's not my child?

00:32:06.541 --> 00:32:08.000
Oh, right.

00:32:08.083 --> 00:32:10.750
I forgot, we all fucked you.
Anyone could be the dad.

00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:17.583
Hey.

00:32:18.541 --> 00:32:19.583
Let go.

00:32:22.291 --> 00:32:24.500
What's up?
Don't you love me anymore?

00:32:24.583 --> 00:32:25.750
I never loved you!

00:32:26.333 --> 00:32:27.666
You murderer!

00:32:29.458 --> 00:32:30.541
You're a killer too.

00:32:52.541 --> 00:32:53.541
Who exactly

00:32:54.708 --> 00:32:55.541
did she kill?

00:32:57.791 --> 00:32:58.916
No.

00:33:00.208 --> 00:33:01.583
I never killed anyone.

00:33:02.958 --> 00:33:04.125
If I tell you,

00:33:04.708 --> 00:33:05.666
will you let me go?

00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:07.041
I never killed anyone!

00:33:18.625 --> 00:33:21.125
Answer me. Who exactly did she kill?

00:33:21.208 --> 00:33:22.625
I didn't.

00:33:23.375 --> 00:33:24.375
I didn't.

00:33:25.458 --> 00:33:27.333
No, I didn't.

00:33:28.291 --> 00:33:29.708
She killed many people.

00:33:29.791 --> 00:33:31.125
No, he's lying!

00:33:31.208 --> 00:33:33.708
Which scammer never got anyone killed?

00:33:33.791 --> 00:33:35.166
People's lives get ruined.

00:33:35.250 --> 00:33:36.750
- They commit suicide.
- Liar.

00:33:37.333 --> 00:33:38.791
Think your daughter didn't?

00:33:40.708 --> 00:33:41.625
Chao Ching.

00:33:42.750 --> 00:33:43.583
Chao Ching.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.250
MONEY GRUBBER

00:33:58.500 --> 00:34:00.041
Peace be upon you.

00:34:00.125 --> 00:34:01.375
Police!

00:34:01.458 --> 00:34:02.458
Open up.

00:34:09.916 --> 00:34:10.958
How can I help you?

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.000
Miss.

00:34:16.083 --> 00:34:17.458
We received a reportâ€¦

00:34:17.541 --> 00:34:18.541
What?

00:34:18.625 --> 00:34:20.791
â€¦about weird sounds
coming from your store.

00:34:20.875 --> 00:34:24.208
We suspect illegal activities,
so we need to check.

00:34:24.291 --> 00:34:26.458
What? I don't understand.

00:34:27.166 --> 00:34:29.708
Wait. There's something at the back.

00:34:29.791 --> 00:34:31.041
- What's inside?
- I'll go.

00:34:31.125 --> 00:34:33.708
- Hey, you can'tâ€¦
- Miss.

00:34:33.791 --> 00:34:35.375
You stay here, okay?

00:35:12.041 --> 00:35:13.291
What are you looking for?

00:35:15.541 --> 00:35:16.958
Found anything strange?

00:35:17.041 --> 00:35:19.375
Nothing so far. Did you find anything?

00:35:19.875 --> 00:35:20.875
No.

00:35:21.875 --> 00:35:23.416
If we can't find anything,

00:35:24.541 --> 00:35:26.208
let's go back.

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:27.833
Let's go.

00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:30.416
Let's go.

00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:31.625
Let's go have supper.

00:35:52.875 --> 00:35:54.500
Why'd you turn your phone off?

00:36:03.916 --> 00:36:05.750
An Chi came over for a chat.

00:36:05.833 --> 00:36:06.875
It got late,

00:36:06.958 --> 00:36:09.708
so I gave her a ride back.

00:36:09.791 --> 00:36:11.958
Thanks. Let's talk tomorrow.

00:36:16.916 --> 00:36:18.083
Here's her phone.

00:36:20.833 --> 00:36:23.166
- Why'd you take her phone?
- You can turn it on.

00:36:23.708 --> 00:36:25.375
Your daughter's a grown-up.

00:36:25.458 --> 00:36:28.625
Give her some space
and stop tracking her location.

00:36:46.416 --> 00:36:47.500
Did you see him?

00:36:49.083 --> 00:36:50.416
I know he'll tell them.

00:36:59.458 --> 00:37:00.458
Don't worry.

00:37:01.916 --> 00:37:03.250
I'll protect you.

00:37:49.333 --> 00:37:50.708
What's going on?

00:37:50.791 --> 00:37:52.583
There was a haunting last night.

00:37:52.666 --> 00:37:55.041
A lot of bugs
crawled out of your brother's urn.

00:37:55.125 --> 00:37:56.125
So horrible.

00:37:57.750 --> 00:37:59.208
What utter BS.

00:38:02.041 --> 00:38:03.041
Don't make a scene.

00:38:17.208 --> 00:38:18.708
Mom, I need to talk.

00:38:19.958 --> 00:38:21.875
We'll talk later, I'm busy.

00:38:31.083 --> 00:38:32.125
Tell everyone to go.

00:38:37.666 --> 00:38:39.000
Let's all take a break.

00:38:42.166 --> 00:38:44.416
Mom, I need some money.

00:38:45.625 --> 00:38:46.625
After money again?

00:38:47.291 --> 00:38:48.166
How much?

00:38:48.250 --> 00:38:49.666
One million US dollars.

00:38:51.250 --> 00:38:52.500
Are you insane?

00:38:54.416 --> 00:38:55.708
Mom.

00:38:55.791 --> 00:38:57.583
You don't seem too good lately.

00:38:58.541 --> 00:39:00.791
Did you make a promise
that you didn't keep?

00:39:01.375 --> 00:39:03.166
So someone came back to get even?

00:39:03.250 --> 00:39:04.708
What are you talking about?

00:39:04.791 --> 00:39:06.500
About what happened last night.

00:39:06.583 --> 00:39:09.916
Why else would a load of bugs
crawl out of his urn?

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:13.041
- That was your doing?
- You're the one with a guilty conscience.

00:39:13.958 --> 00:39:17.208
You promised Kai to give me some money,
but kept putting it off.

00:39:17.291 --> 00:39:19.041
No wonder he came back for revenge.

00:39:19.125 --> 00:39:21.333
Nonsense. There's no such thing as ghosts.

00:39:22.041 --> 00:39:24.458
No such thing?
Then what's this ritual for?

00:39:25.416 --> 00:39:28.083
One last time.
One million US dollars, yes or no?

00:39:29.250 --> 00:39:30.458
I can't give it to you.

00:39:31.041 --> 00:39:33.750
I've given all the money
to the Sanching Association.

00:39:33.833 --> 00:39:35.375
I don't have access to it.

00:39:35.458 --> 00:39:36.625
Ask me again later.

00:39:40.458 --> 00:39:41.916
Need I remind you?

00:39:44.791 --> 00:39:45.916
Don't forget

00:39:47.375 --> 00:39:49.083
what you did to Kai before he died.

00:39:50.833 --> 00:39:51.958
He might not know,

00:39:53.083 --> 00:39:53.916
but I,

00:39:56.583 --> 00:39:58.083
I know all too well.

00:40:08.625 --> 00:40:10.958
Transfer me the money tomorrow morning.

00:40:12.125 --> 00:40:14.041
Or it won't just be ghosts after you,

00:40:14.708 --> 00:40:16.000
it'll be the police too.

00:40:35.250 --> 00:40:37.250
All clear, let's go.

00:40:46.458 --> 00:40:48.250
Can't you be more careful?

00:40:48.791 --> 00:40:50.541
You better not mess up

00:40:50.625 --> 00:40:51.833
and drag me into it.

00:40:52.625 --> 00:40:54.500
Sorry, understood.

00:40:54.583 --> 00:40:56.041
Thanks for warning us.

00:40:56.125 --> 00:40:57.958
Or we'd have been screwed.

00:41:00.625 --> 00:41:01.958
I'll keep my eyes open.

00:41:02.833 --> 00:41:04.333
- I'd better go.
- Thank you.

00:41:37.458 --> 00:41:40.375
Stop making a noise.
No one's coming to save you.

00:42:03.791 --> 00:42:05.125
Surprise!

00:42:05.208 --> 00:42:07.083
I told you. Just a few days.

00:42:09.916 --> 00:42:11.000
So soon.

00:42:12.541 --> 00:42:13.375
Wellâ€¦

00:42:14.416 --> 00:42:15.250
Iâ€¦

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:20.583
Long time no see.

00:43:42.458 --> 00:43:44.666
He said some friends inside
took care of him.

00:43:44.750 --> 00:43:46.083
Did he get any leads?

00:43:50.125 --> 00:43:53.125
He said weâ€™re not the only ones
who want Chang Shih-kai dead.

00:43:53.791 --> 00:43:55.166
Others want him dead too?
