(The court)

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.480

(and new trends emerge
among the commoners.)

to embrace the new,)

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.640

dining habits.)

(The best delicacies in the world
are in Yong'an,)

(or focus on elegance.)

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.600

in Juxian Alley.)

(with our ancestor...)

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.510

Do you even know I am your brother?

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:32.620
How disrespectful!

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:33.820
You scared me to death.

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:35.460
Then act like a brother.

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:36.540
The stuff has all arrived.

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:37.480

Jicai,

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:40.660
is your video

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:42.420
going to take us back to ancient times

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:44.140
and cook for our ancestors?

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:45.540
Can this really work?

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:47.120
Absolutely.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.060
I've put in all the savings
I made from writing

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:50.700
for that internet celebrity company.

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.100
But it's only enough for five episodes.

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:54.700
So, we can only succeed,

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:55.540
not fail.

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.500
We must make our diner a hit.

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:00.060
Get into costume.

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.440
Auntie, where are we going
to shoot the video?

I'm Shen Jianshe.

our children Shaojie

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:27.300

with better business

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.620
and bring it back to life.

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:41.980
Grandma,

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:43.100
what kind of person

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:44.420
was our ancestor?

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:45.860
You should ask your father

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:47.900
and your aunt about that.

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:50.020
Your great-grandpa only told them.

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:52.500
Well.

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:55.900
You must remember

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.380
the story of our ancestor.

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:02.500
Over a thousand years ago,

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:05.500
Lin Yan,
Vice Prefect of Capital Prefecture,

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:07.420
came to the Capital to take office

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:09.900
and moved into Yunshui Manor.

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:11.980
Vice Prefect Lin

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:14.380
married into our family.

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:16.260
What happened next?

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:17.300
I'll tell you later.

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:18.140
Let's hurry up,

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:19.080
or we'll lose the light.

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:20.780
Exactly. Hurry up.

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:23.060
Jicai, don't we still need someone

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:24.580
to play our ancestor Lin Yan?

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:26.940
Wait here. I'll grab someone.

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:29.580
(We've been disconnected
for so many generations.)

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:31.380
(Who knows what happened in between?)

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:33.180
(Grabbing someone)

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:34.900
(shouldn't be offensive, right?)

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:35.820
What?

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:36.940
I'm at the Yunshui Manor.

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:38.220
I'll go find you later.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:41.140
Alright, got it.

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:50.960
Is this okay?

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:53.170
Try another one. Change the pose.

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:54.100
Okay.

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:55.620
Hi, friend.

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:58.220
I'm not a bad person.

00:06:58.220 --> 00:06:59.460
I just need a favor.

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:00.460
You...

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:07.780
Friend.

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:20.180
Friend?

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:31.100
Where did he go?

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:35.500
Hi?

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:36.900
Is anyone there?

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:40.940
Hello?

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:50.220
(Ancestral Temple, Kitchen)

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:51.820
Hi.

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:53.340
Handsome guy?

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:05.100
He left through the back door?

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:36.420
Everyone, watch closely.

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:40.290
Okay.

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:42.340
Eat.

00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:46.060
Huamo is ready.

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:55.580
Isn't there a mountain
outside the back door?

00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:57.220
What's going on here?

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:04.420
It smells so good.

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:29.860
Something's not right.

00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:42.780
Is anyone here?

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:44.300
Anyone here?

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:46.420
Is anyone here?

00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:18.300
Jicai!

00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:20.420
- Jicai!
- Auntie!

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:21.860
- Over here.
- Jicai.

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:22.700
Auntie.

00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:24.780
- Auntie.
- Jicai.

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:27.200
You scared me to death.

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:28.500
- Auntie.
- What's wrong?

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:29.780
- What's wrong?
- What happened?

00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:30.860
Yunshui Manor is gone.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:32.100
It's gone.

00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:33.660
Yunshui Manor is gone?

00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:35.220
How did you guys get here?

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:36.820
We were just looking for you.

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:39.060
There was a sudden fog.

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:39.770
Yes.

00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:41.140
We were walking and ended up here.

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:42.060
There was the fog.

00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:42.400
Auntie,

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:44.140
is this a new project
for the scenic spot?

00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:45.620
Let me tell you, Jicai.

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:46.820
Don't worry.

00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:48.860
This must be an event here.

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:50.940
We got in for free.

00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:53.580
- Let's go.
- A flower cart parade.

00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:54.740
It's really lively.

00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:55.580
Let's check it out.

00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:57.940
- So beautiful.
- This place.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:10:59.500
Everyone is in ancient costumes.

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:01.380
Look, your clothes are still here.

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:02.220
Jicai.

00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:05.700
This is so unique.

00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:07.660
What kind of dance are they performing?

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:09.180
If I'm not mistaken,

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:10.540
this must be a large-scale

00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:12.220
live-action role-playing game.

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:13.340
What's a role-playing game?

00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:15.260
You don't know role-playing games?

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:16.300
Have you ever played one?

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:17.660
I haven't.

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:20.820
Let's go.

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:23.260
Look at all the money
they must've spent.

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:25.220
Quite a spectacle.

00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:28.540
(Jinwu Guards Wanted Notice)
Look.

00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:29.660
There's a wanted notice.

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:30.660
They drew a fat man.

00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:33.260
This is so much fun.

00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:34.580
- Look.
- How vivid.

00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:36.340
(Jinwu Guards Wanted Notice)
These details.

00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:37.900
- Jinwu...
- Really.

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:39.100
How to pronounce this?

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:39.940
Jicai.

00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:40.980
Guard.

00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:51.900
Isn't that the actor?

00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:53.040
He looks so much like him.

00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:53.740
Yes, he does.

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:55.300
- You don't get it.
- Just like him.

00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:57.300
In a role-playing game,
they aren't called actors.

00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:58.460
They're called NPC.

00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:02.580
The Jinwu Guards are working.

00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:03.980
Make way.

00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:06.940
The game has started.

00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:07.780
It has started.

00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:45.700
- Good.
- Good.

00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:48.000
The acting is so good.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.140
- It feels real.
- Yes, Dad.

00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:50.540
It does feel very real.

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:52.820
Look at their performance.

00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:55.580
Dad, Mom,

00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:57.300
something feels off to me.

00:12:57.420 --> 00:12:59.180
You guys have never played this game.

00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:00.390
- Too sensitive.
- Amazing.

00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:01.180
- Wow.
- So good.

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:02.100
It must be fake.

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:02.740
The blood is

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:03.860
- just ketchup.
- Gongcai...

00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:05.130
Time to get off work.

00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:12.140
- Gongcai, what's wrong?
- Dad.

00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:13.260
- Dad.
- He's dead.

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:14.580
Dad, I'm scared.

00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:15.610
Dead?

00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:16.660
Make way, make way.

00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:19.280
Yangyang, hurry.

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:20.980
- Don't obstruct official duties.
- Dad.

00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:21.920
- Yangyang.
- Yangyang.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.300
- Drag him back.
- Come here.

00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:24.440
- Yes.
- What are you doing?

00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:28.700
How could this be real death?

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:31.640
Run!

00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:33.480
To the police station.

00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:34.540
To the police station!

00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:35.940
Hey,

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:37.860
where is the police station?

00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:38.800
There's a dead person.

00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:39.940
We need to report it.

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:41.300
Sir, what are you saying?

00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:42.360
You must be too scared.

00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:43.580
They are arresting a thief.

00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:44.520
They have to kill him.

00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:45.700
You guys should leave.

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:46.520
Once it gets dark,

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:47.460
there will be a curfew.

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:48.740
I'm leaving first.

00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:50.420
Isn't this a role-playing game?

00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:52.140
Isn't this supposed to be a game?

00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:53.900
What's going on?

00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:57.580
Ouch.

00:13:57.940 --> 00:13:58.780
What are you doing?

00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:00.300
This isn't a dream.

00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:03.400
- It's not a dream.
- What's happening?

00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:04.300
We...

00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:05.500
Could it be

00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:07.620
we've time-traveled?

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:09.100
Time-traveled?

00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:11.940
If I'm not mistaken,

00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:13.820
this is

00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:18.300
Yong'an.

00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:22.220
(Minfu Inn)

00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:27.780
(Minfu Inn)

00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:29.420
This really is Yong'an.

00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:31.780
Heavenly blessings.

00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:33.220
What are you talking about?

00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:35.540
We've time-traveled.

00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:38.820
We need a standard room.

00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:39.940
We...

00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:43.900
We'll squeeze into one.

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:45.380
What do you mean?

00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:46.500
A room.

00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:47.420
A small one will do.

00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:48.420
Yes, yes.

00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:50.380
Mom.

00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:51.420
Well.

00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:55.780
Can we use this to pay for the room?

00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:01.140
It's pure 24-karat gold.

00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:03.300
Yes, no problem.

00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:04.860
That's great.

00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:07.900
(Earth Room 1)

00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:16.300
The challenge we faced today

00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:18.300
is the most severe one

00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:20.460
our family has ever encountered.

00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:22.980
So, today's family meeting

00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:24.420
is to discuss

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:26.140
what we should do next.

00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:39.420
Shen Jianshe,

00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:41.580
you start with some constructive advice.

00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:43.780
I'll just say a few things briefly.

00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:47.140
The challenge we faced today

00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:48.940
is the most severe one

00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:50.300
our family has ever encountered.

00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:52.140
We need to look at this issue

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:53.980
comprehensively and objectively.

00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:55.620
As for what

00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:57.260
we should do next,

00:15:57.660 --> 00:16:00.500
I think we should go back first.

00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:01.780
That's it?

00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:02.820
That's it.

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:04.020
All nonsense.

00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:07.300
I knew I couldn't count on you.

00:16:08.390 --> 00:16:09.780
Hey, Shen Gongcai.

00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:10.780
Give your opinion.

00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:15.300
How to go back

00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:16.820
is especially important.

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:19.460
We need to analyze it carefully,

00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:21.500
but I really can't come up
with anything.

00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:23.820
Fortunately, Jicai came with us.

00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:25.080
She's good at history.

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:26.740
She knows
how to exchange gold for money.

00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:29.220
Otherwise, we might all be in jail now.

00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:30.580
All nonsense.

00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:32.660
I knew I couldn't count on you.

00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:35.740
Dear, let me discipline him for you.

00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:37.820
If you don't speak,
no one will think you're mute.

00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:41.540
Jicai,

00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:42.940
you tell us.

00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:45.260
Based on the map we saw

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:46.460
at Yunshui Manor,

00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:48.580
the manor is in that direction.

00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:50.900
Since we came through Yunshui Manor,

00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:52.920
we need to go there
to figure something out.

00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:55.060
Yunshui Manor...

00:16:57.660 --> 00:16:59.290
(Yunshui Manor)

00:16:59.290 --> 00:17:00.620
Round 1.

00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:02.140
Can this get us in?

00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:04.260
We have to try.

00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:06.140
Stop!

00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:09.980
This is the private residence
of the Vice Prefect.

00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:10.900
You can't enter.

00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:16.340
Sir,

00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:17.740
please let us in.

00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:19.780
This is pure 24-karat gold.

00:17:19.860 --> 00:17:20.700
Go!

00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:23.100
Why would you risk bribery

00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:25.180
just to break into the mansion

00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:26.020
of the Vice Prefect?

00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:27.300
Don't get excited.

00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:28.980
My mother has hysteria.

00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:30.380
I'm taking her home right away.

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:32.940
You're about to have an episode.

00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:34.580
Let's go home.

00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:38.660
(Day 3)

00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:42.380
- Here.
- Thank you.

00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:43.220
Take it.

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:46.460
Round 2.

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:51.740
Did you see anything?

00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:52.660
What are you doing?

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:54.940
It's none of my business.

00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:56.460
- Stop!
- None of my business.

00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:57.300
Stop!

00:17:58.100 --> 00:17:59.220
Gongcai!

00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:04.060
(Day 5)

00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:04.900
Here.

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:16.570
Round 3.

00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:24.140
It seems no one's around.

00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:25.660
If no one's here, move aside.

00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:26.500
Let me do it.

00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:35.620
Hurry, hurry.

00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:38.220
(Day...)

00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:39.700
We don't have much money left.

00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:41.380
Let's save

00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:42.900
half of this pancake for tomorrow.

00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:45.460
Eating pancakes every day.

00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:46.900
I'm about to go crazy.

00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:48.820
I really can't eat another bite.

00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:49.740
You won't eat it?

00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:51.060
Then let me have it.

00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:52.780
Having pancakes is not bad at all.

00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:53.860
Besides,

00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:55.020
right now, our whole family

00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:56.580
is relying on your mom's

00:18:56.580 --> 00:18:57.940
gold jewelry.

00:18:58.380 --> 00:18:59.220
We have to save.

00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:01.060
Isn't that right, Fengxia?

00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:02.740
That makes sense.

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:08.140
Everyone, I've found out
from the shopkeeper

00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:09.320
that our ancestor Lin Yan

00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:10.300
is about to take office

00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:11.580
and will soon enter the Capital.

00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:12.420
Really?

00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:14.220
That's great!

00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:15.660
He should be responsible for us.

00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:17.860
He can't just bring us into this world
and ignore us.

00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:18.700
Everyone,

00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:20.180
hope is coming.

00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:22.490
Let's have a meeting.

00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:23.700
A meeting.

00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:25.500
Jicai.

00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:27.340
Come and sit here.

00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:29.010
- Jicai.
- I'm fine where.

00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:31.060
- We need to talk.
- Dad.

00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:32.060
- What for?
- The usual.

00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:33.250
It's nothing.

00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:34.420
Auntie, come here.

00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:40.140
- Listen to me.
- Okay.

00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:41.860
Before, the master wasn't home,

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:42.740
so the guards

00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:43.980
didn't dare let us in.

00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:45.660
If Lin Yan arrives,

00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:47.460
and we get close to him,

00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:49.380
then we might have a chance to go home.

00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:51.340
That's what I mean.

00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:55.740
Now, there's a more serious problem.

00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:57.220
What problem?

00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:00.340
Gold

00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:01.940
will eventually run out.

00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:03.620
We'll soon have no money left.

00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:06.820
We need to find a way
to make some money.

00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:07.940
Shen Jianshe,

00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:10.660
I hope you can give

00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:12.780
some constructive ideas
on how to make money.

00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:13.980
Me?

00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:15.540
Well.

00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:17.500
Why is it always me?

00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:19.180
Well, I think

00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:20.540
making money

00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:21.860
is out of the question.

00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:23.780
We just have to save money.

00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:26.020
To save money, you have to eat less.

00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:27.980
If you eat less, you move less.

00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:29.000
Best not to move at all.

00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:30.580
If you don't move, you won't be hungry.

00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:32.340
If you're not hungry,
you won't spend money.

00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:33.380
Listen

00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:34.620
to what you're saying.

00:20:34.790 --> 00:20:35.660
Do you realize now

00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:36.900
how you managed

00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:38.420
to ruin our diner?

00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:39.540
Is that thing on your neck

00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:40.740
just for show?

00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:42.420
What kind of silly idea is that?

00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:43.860
Mom, no, no.

00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:45.260
Don't get worked up.

00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:47.100
What Dad is trying to say

00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:48.140
is about cutting expenses

00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:49.580
and increasing income.

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:50.580
Well.

00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:52.420
Dad is just not very articulate.

00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:54.340
Dad, that's not right.

00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:55.940
Get up.

00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:57.760
What are you saying?
Mom has explained it,

00:20:57.760 --> 00:20:59.020
and you still don't understand?

00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:00.140
At such a critical moment,

00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:01.260
how can you say that?

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:02.140
As usual.

00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:03.340
I just spoke up for you again.

00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:04.460
Give me another 20.

00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:05.700
I don't have any money.

00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:06.820
Will you give it to me?

00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:08.100
I really don't have any.

00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:09.860
Mom, what Dad actually meant...

00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:10.700
Gongcai.

00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:13.140
You just made

00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:14.500
a point.

00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:21.300
What Dad actually meant

00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:23.100
was that he should've brought

00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:25.540
some gold or silver

00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:27.080
to ease our worries, right?

00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:28.220
- Yes.
- He meant that.

00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:29.460
Could he have thought of that?

00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:30.860
- I was just thinking.
- Gold?

00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:32.460
I have gold, too.

00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:36.460
Great-grandpa gave it to me.

00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:41.260
Before our ancestor takes office,

00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:43.140
we need to find a way to survive.

00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:44.020
How about

00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:45.380
going back to the old business?

00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:46.220
Why don't we

00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:47.940
set up a small stall

00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:49.220
and sell some snacks?

00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:50.500
I can do that.

00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:52.260
Can we make Jianbing Guozi?

00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:54.140
I love Jianbing Guozi the most.

00:21:57.180 --> 00:21:58.940
That's a good idea.

00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:01.500
Let's split up.

00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:03.960
Yangyang and I will try
to get close to our ancestor

00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:05.360
and find a way into Yunshui Manor.

00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:07.340
You guys set up the stall
and make money.

00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:08.860
I've got an idea

00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:10.760
that's sure
to make Jianbing Guozi a hit.

00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:19.660
(Xuanzheng Hall)

00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:24.780
I've heard that the newly appointed
Vice Prefect Lin Yan

00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:26.660
is not from a prestigious family,

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:28.580
nor did he study
under any famous mentors.

00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:29.700
He's made his way up

00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:31.420
entirely on his own merits

00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:32.660
without any patronage.

00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:35.220
His Majesty has promoted him
by exception

00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:38.060
and even granted him
a jade belt and a gold fish token,

00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:39.500
making him like a Rank III official.

00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:41.200
I've also heard

00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:43.900
that His Majesty
even decided his salary,

00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:45.860
equivalent to a Rank II official.

00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:49.820
(Lin Yan, Vice Prefect
of Capital Prefecture)

00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:53.380
Mr. Lin is extremely talented
and handsome.

00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:55.980
(Mr. Meng, Left Supervisor)
Your granddaughter

00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:57.500
is of marriageable age.

00:22:57.980 --> 00:23:01.420
Why don't you ask him?

00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:02.960
There will be so many suitors

00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:05.500
that his doorstep will be worn down.

00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:06.700
I'm afraid

00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:09.340
I can't match up.

00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:11.540
You must be joking.

00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:15.220
- Vice Prefect Lin.
- Vice Prefect Lin.

00:23:18.570 --> 00:23:20.300
You flatter me.

00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:21.540
We're outside the hall.

00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:22.380
I'm the junior here.

00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:24.500
I should greet you all first.

00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:26.340
It's fine.

00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:36.900
His Majesty is not feeling well today,

00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:39.900
so please go back.

00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:42.900
His Majesty won't listen
to reports today.

00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:45.420
Vice Prefect Lin, wait a moment.

00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:48.580
His Majesty has asked you to see him.

00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:03.940
(Emperor Yuanfeng)

00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:11.500
Your Majesty.

00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:24.060
Since you're unwell,

00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:25.180
you should rest.

00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:27.420
Why call me to play Chupu?

00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:29.820
Eunuch Qin, please take it away.

00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:31.180
Don't.

00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:33.820
Alright, alright.

00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:35.860
I won't cheat.

00:24:36.330 --> 00:24:38.300
Just finish this game.

00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:40.140
I'm already in the Capital.

00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:42.020
I'm ready to play anytime.

00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:43.460
But right now,

00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:45.720
there's something more important
I need to report.

00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:49.380
You're using official business
to block me.

00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:52.740
Go ahead.

00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:55.740
You asked me to handle
the embezzlement case

00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:57.500
of disaster relief funds
in Huaiyuan County.

00:24:57.740 --> 00:24:59.980
The ringleader is the local magistrate.

00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:02.300
He wanted to redeem his crime with gold,

00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:03.340
but I rejected it.

00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:05.380
He was beheaded two days ago.

00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:07.660
You've done a good job.

00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:10.020
But the surname of this magistrate

00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:11.500
is Dou,

00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:14.940
and he is a relative
of Noble Consort Dou.

00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:17.660
Lin Yan,

00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:19.300
how dare you!

00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:29.020
Please let me explain.

00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:31.800
The amount of pepper stored
in Magistrate Dou's residence

00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:32.460
is enormous,

00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:35.220
enough to supply
the East and West Areas for four years.

00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:36.380
The price of pepper per jin

00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:37.640
is far more valuable than gold.

00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:40.020
At that time,
the displaced people suffered greatly.

00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:41.300
The commoners couldn't get food,

00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:42.860
and even exchanged children for food.

00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:45.500
If such a huge embezzler
could be spared from death,

00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:46.500
I really don't know

00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:48.660
how to convince the people.

00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:54.380
This case has been investigated
for years without results.

00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:57.500
How did you get the evidence?

00:25:58.460 --> 00:25:59.540
Under Magistrate Dou,

00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:01.220
there was a Yun,

00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:02.980
who was a love-struck fool.

00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:06.500
How dare you torture me?

00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:07.820
When I get out of here,

00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:09.260
I'll kill you first.

00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:19.780
Mr. Yun,

00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:22.860
how could I torture you?

00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:25.900
It's just that there is something

00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:28.060
that is not convenient
to show in public,

00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:29.620
so I invited you

00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:31.260
for a private talk.

00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:35.580
Familiar?

00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:37.900
How did this letter end up with you?

00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:39.220
Give it to me.

00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:40.540
Give it to me!

00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:42.860
(Dear, ever since I saw you,
my mind has been restless.)

00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:45.580
You've been following Magistrate Dou
for such a long time

00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:49.820
that you've fallen in love
with his concubine.

00:26:50.740 --> 00:26:51.580
Guess.

00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:53.420
How would he treat you?

00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:01.220
Why not

00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:03.580
hand over the evidence

00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:05.300
and send him on his way?

00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:06.580
Then,

00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:09.540
you can be together

00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:11.860
with your beloved.

00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:14.820
What a disappointment.

00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:16.540
Well.

00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:20.100
It's only right to execute
the ringleader

00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:22.220
of the embezzlement case.

00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:25.980
Just now, you mentioned
the East and West Areas.

00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:28.820
It seems you know

00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:30.620
the annual expenses there.

00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:33.700
You must've done some homework
before taking office.

00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:36.860
Han people
and other ethnic groups trade there.

00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:37.800
Everyone can be there.

00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:40.320
Officials and eunuchs engage

00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:42.200
in business there
for profit under a pretense.

00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:43.440
The situation is complicated.

00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:45.060
To do things in the Capital,

00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:46.340
it is crucial

00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:47.620
to control those areas.

00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:51.460
The previous Prefects
of Capital Prefecture

00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:53.860
have all resigned.

00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:56.340
They were worried

00:27:56.860 --> 00:27:59.140
that they couldn't get through
the key points.

00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:03.060
If you were in charge,

00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:05.700
what would you do?

00:28:05.780 --> 00:28:07.280
Food matters the most to the people.

00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:08.900
I want to start with Juxian Alley,

00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:10.420
which is famous for its food,

00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:11.740
starting with the small things.

00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:16.980
Quite a few people in the court

00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:18.500
see you as a thorn in their side,

00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:19.460
but I

00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:21.660
have high hopes for you.

00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:23.940
You must control the Areas,

00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:26.420
but do not rush.

00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:29.500
For now, mainly conduct inspections.

00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:33.060
Once you have secured your position,

00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:34.900
you can take action.

00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:37.300
I am willing to serve you.

00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:46.180
(Liu Chang, Lin Yan's attendant)

00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:47.780
Young Master,

00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:49.220
Juxian Alley is just ahead.

00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:50.980
Shall we go down and inspect?

00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:57.100
(Juxian Alley)

00:28:57.100 --> 00:28:58.460
Come on, passers-by,

00:28:58.460 --> 00:28:59.780
(Jianbing Guozi)
don't miss out.

00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:01.820
Take a look, have a look.

00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:05.060
The one-of-a-kind pancake of Yong'an,

00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:07.580
Jianbing Guozi.

00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:08.860
Take a look.

00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:09.980
Come on, everyone.

00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:11.620
Take a look, have a look.

00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:12.980
Today,

00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:15.620
the Shen Jianbing Guozi Auction

00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:17.340
officially begins.

00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:19.420
Starting bid at five qian

00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:20.500
for one Jianbing Guozi.

00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:21.780
Limited quantity.

00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:23.060
First come, first served.

00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:25.500
What do you mean by bidding?

00:29:25.660 --> 00:29:26.820
What's a starting bid?

00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:28.460
That means the initial price

00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:29.300
of this

00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:32.340
is five qian.

00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:34.540
What if other customers also want it?

00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:36.860
You can openly bid higher.

00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:38.980
The highest bidder wins.

00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:40.580
Highest bidder wins?

00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:42.240
This is just taking advantage of us.

00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:44.100
Five qian is already a lot,
and you want more?

00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:45.020
Let's go.

00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:46.460
Wait, wait, everyone.

00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:48.180
Calm down.

00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:49.580
Do you know

00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:52.140
who my dad...

00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:53.620
Father.

00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:55.140
My father.

00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:57.420
Do you know who he is?

00:29:58.740 --> 00:29:59.700
Let me tell you.

00:30:00.020 --> 00:30:00.860
He is the master

00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:03.100
of cuisine across time,

00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:04.620
the only one of his kind in the world,

00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:05.820
and the undisputed ruler

00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:07.940
of the pancake realm.

00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:09.420
Is that true?

00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:10.580
That's amazing.

00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:11.980
Of course, it's that amazing.

00:30:12.660 --> 00:30:13.580
And look at this dish.

00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:16.100
It's called Jianbing Guozi.

00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:18.340
Have you ever heard of it before?

00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:20.260
I haven't.

00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:21.200
That's because my father

00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:22.900
once traveled the world

00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:24.340
and visited

00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:27.060
a legendary place

00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:28.020
called

00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:29.060
Tianjin.

00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:30.500
Where is that?

00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:31.940
It is

00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:33.980
an extremely prosperous port.

00:30:34.100 --> 00:30:35.420
What's Tianjin?

00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:36.460
Never heard of it.

00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:37.330
Going to Tianjin

00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:39.980
is like facing 81 tribulations.

00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:41.260
Back in the day,

00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:42.820
my father, with my mother,

00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:44.060
my sister, and my daughter,

00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:45.060
went through a lot.

00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:49.820
♪You carry the load♪

00:30:50.540 --> 00:30:54.260
♪I lead the horse♪

00:30:54.260 --> 00:30:55.140
That's interesting.

00:30:55.140 --> 00:30:58.740
♪We welcome the sunrise♪

00:30:59.060 --> 00:31:03.100
♪We bid farewell to Fengxia♪

00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:05.500
Farewell to the evening glow.

00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:06.590
After all the difficulties,

00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:08.280
they arrived in Tianjin.

00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:09.540
On a whim,

00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:11.900
they combined pancakes

00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:13.460
with the locals' favorite fruit.

00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:16.460
What's this?

00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:20.460
It's crispy and delicious.

00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:22.820
And thus, they combined together.

00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:24.100
The greatest

00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:26.300
culinary creation in history,

00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:28.820
Jianbing Guozi, was born.

00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:31.740
That's amazing.

00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:32.700
Great, great.

00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:34.180
- This is good.
- Good.

00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:36.220
Jianbing Guozi is

00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:37.860
really something new.

00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:39.060
It smells so good.

00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:40.740
I'll bid five qian

00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:42.100
to give it a try.

00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:43.980
Excuse me, sir.

00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:45.620
Didn't we just agree?

00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:47.100
Our pancake

00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:48.580
is for auction.

00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:50.140
- Auction?
- Starting at five qian.

00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:52.380
And our Chef Shen

00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:54.660
can only make five pancakes a day.

00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:57.140
At most one every two hours.

00:31:57.660 --> 00:31:58.620
So, if both of you

00:31:58.620 --> 00:32:00.140
want to try this pancake,

00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:01.580
you'll have to bid higher.

00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:02.740
Bid higher.

00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:03.900
He doesn't want it; I do.

00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:04.740
No, no.

00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:06.540
I didn't say I don't want it.

00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:07.540
- I bid
- Queue up.

00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:08.570
- six qian.
- Okay.

00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:09.780
Six qian.

00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:11.420
It's already six qian.

00:32:11.420 --> 00:32:12.300
I'll bid eight.

00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:13.080
Eight qian.

00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:14.780
- Is that the final bid?
- I'll bid ten.

00:32:14.780 --> 00:32:16.300
Ten qian, ten qian.

00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:17.940
- Any more bids?
- 11 qian.

00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:19.340
This stall here

00:32:20.060 --> 00:32:21.580
is using some tricks.

00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:23.780
It's just taking advantage
of these commoners

00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:24.940
who don't know

00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:26.760
that there's no such port
called Tianjin.

00:32:28.660 --> 00:32:29.940
- 11 qian.
- I'll bid 12.

00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:30.940
12 qian.

00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:31.780
I'll bid 12 qian.

00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:35.260
(Divine Pancake)
(The ancestor returns home today.)

00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:37.420
(I'll definitely run into him here.)

00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:42.500
Auntie,

00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:43.660
are we setting up this stall

00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:44.980
to wait for our ancestor?

00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:46.140
Yes.

00:32:46.420 --> 00:32:48.460
We're making delicious food
right at his doorstep

00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:50.020
to catch his attention,

00:32:50.020 --> 00:32:51.300
do business with him,

00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:52.500
befriend him,

00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:54.500
and then get invited to his home.

00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:56.420
But Auntie,

00:32:56.420 --> 00:32:57.580
have you thought

00:32:57.740 --> 00:32:58.940
that what if our ancestor

00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:00.780
doesn't like Jianbing Guozi?

00:33:00.780 --> 00:33:02.260
Our family has loved Jianbing Guozi

00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:03.580
for three generations.

00:33:03.580 --> 00:33:05.220
It's in our genes.

00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:06.820
The ancestor

00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:08.920
(Yunshui Manor)
will surely like it.

00:33:10.300 --> 00:33:11.140
You...

00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:12.220
- What?
- Young Master.

00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:13.140
Sir,

00:33:13.540 --> 00:33:15.260
I have a few questions for you.

00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:17.460
- This?
- You...

00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:18.780
The batter is made from flour.

00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:20.100
You can buy a peck for 20 qian.

00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:21.620
Scallions cost two qian a bunch.

00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:23.540
Sesame and salt are more expensive,

00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:24.700
but it doesn't cost much.

00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:26.060
Why does this pancake

00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:28.180
have to be 12 qian each?

00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:29.580
What's wrong with you?

00:33:29.580 --> 00:33:31.500
Are you just causing trouble?

00:33:34.100 --> 00:33:35.180
Inflating the market price.

00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:37.200
If this is reported
to the Market Office,

00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:39.740
it won't be a small matter.

00:33:41.260 --> 00:33:42.580
Threatening me?

00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:44.160
Do you think I was raised to be scared?

00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:45.580
What Market Office?

00:33:54.420 --> 00:33:56.300
- Fengxia.
- Why grab me?

00:33:56.380 --> 00:33:57.700
- This...
- Ancestor...

00:33:57.700 --> 00:33:58.940
- What ancestor?
- Ancestor...

00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:01.140
The portrait in the ancestral hall.

00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:01.980
The ancestral hall?

00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:03.240
- The portrait?
- The portrait.

00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:04.260
- In that case,
- Look.

00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:05.620
I'll go report it.

00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:06.940
So much money.

00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:07.780
Exactly.

00:34:08.180 --> 00:34:09.500
Unscrupulous merchants.

00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:10.830
Exactly.

00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:11.780
Calm down, calm down.

00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:13.100
- I...
- Be normal.

00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:14.780
My ancestor.

00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:15.940
Vice Prefect Lin.

00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:17.260
Vice Prefect Lin, please wait.

00:34:17.540 --> 00:34:18.380
Vice Prefect Lin.

00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:25.180
I'm sorry.

00:34:25.180 --> 00:34:26.020
Vice Prefect Lin.

00:34:26.140 --> 00:34:28.140
We didn't mean it.

00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:29.820
We're just running a small business,

00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:31.820
trying to make a bit more money.

00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:32.820
Could you

00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:34.340
give us another chance?

00:34:34.740 --> 00:34:36.780
My name is Shen Jianshe.

00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:37.740
Today,

00:34:37.740 --> 00:34:40.620
I'm truly honored to meet you.

00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:44.940
Be normal.

00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:46.140
Calm down.

00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:49.140
Ma'am,

00:34:49.740 --> 00:34:50.900
you know me?

00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:53.260
I didn't recognize you at first,

00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:55.580
but after a second look,

00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:57.470
you're a person of extraordinary talent.

00:34:57.470 --> 00:34:58.280
You impressed me.

00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:00.020
How could I not recognize you?

00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:02.140
A person of extraordinary talent.

00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:03.660
Talented indeed.

00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:06.260
Alive...

00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:10.100
Vice Prefect, a misunderstanding.

00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:11.260
I was wrong.

00:35:11.260 --> 00:35:12.420
At least you know that.

00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:15.020
I'll give you another chance.

00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:16.340
Restore the normal market price,

00:35:16.340 --> 00:35:17.190
and never do it again.

00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:18.060
Otherwise,

00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:19.700
I'll go to the Market Office

00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:20.900
and convict you.

00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:21.940
- Okay.
- Vice Prefect.

00:35:21.940 --> 00:35:22.780
You decide.

00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:26.640
They were

00:35:26.650 --> 00:35:28.500
just joking with you.

00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:29.860
These pancakes

00:35:30.580 --> 00:35:31.940
are all one qian each.

00:35:31.940 --> 00:35:32.780
- One?
- Okay.

00:35:32.780 --> 00:35:34.220
- One qian?
- That's right.

00:35:34.380 --> 00:35:35.220
That's right.

00:35:35.380 --> 00:35:36.220
Go, go, go.

00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:37.620
Ancestor.

00:35:37.650 --> 00:35:38.500
Am I dreaming?

00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:39.900
We saw our ancestor here.

00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:40.990
I'll take one, please.

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:42.460
My goodness.

00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:43.820
Ancestor.

00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:45.920
No pushing.

00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:47.540
No need to rush; everyone will get some.

00:35:47.540 --> 00:35:48.380
My shoe fell off.

00:35:58.940 --> 00:36:01.060
Don't worry; everyone will get some.

00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:05.020
Auntie.

00:36:27.220 --> 00:36:28.060
Please make way.

00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:29.220
Excuse me.

00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:31.820
I haven't bought yet.

00:36:31.970 --> 00:36:33.090
- Auntie.
- Don't leave.

00:36:33.090 --> 00:36:34.340
I still want to buy.

00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:37.110
- Vice Prefect, wait.
- Don't leave.

00:36:39.890 --> 00:36:40.940
Be careful!

00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:13.860

to five colors.)
