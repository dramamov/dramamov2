00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:27.810
Good morning.

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:38.220
This smell is...

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.630
(Ham and eggs, natto, white rice,
and seaweed and tofu miso soup)

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.060
Yes! A perfect score again today.

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:07.110
Time to eat.

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.790
- Let's eat.
- Let's eat.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.160
Hey, bro.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:11.740
Hm?

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:12.630
Um...

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.550
this breakfast guessing game...

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.550
How long are you gonna keep this up?

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.090
As long as breakfast is on the table,
the game goes on.

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.570
Are you for real?

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.160
Still, that's pretty amazing.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.330
Guessing all that just from the smell.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.040
- Pretty impressive, huh?
- That wasn't a compliment.

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:28.590
That reminds me, though.

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.120
With a nose like a dog's...

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.110
can't you put it to good use somehow?

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:35.390
Oh.

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:37.420
How about becoming a police dog?

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:38.430
A police dog?

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:39.730
Hey, not a bad idea.

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:41.070
That's a pretty good idea.

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.420
It's decided then, bro.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.020
Ah, and dessert is apples.

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:52.430
You got it.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.340
Bro, you really are incredible.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.510
You could be a super-elite K-9 unit.

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:58.220
For sure.

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:02.550
Elite, huh...

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:04.680
Well...

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.690
Whether or not I become a police dog in the future...

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.360
let's put that aside for now.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.830
This scent...

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.340
It's the daily special from the student cafeteria.

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:25.490
Beef and potato stew.

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.470
Scent...

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.130
has the power to evoke associated
memories and emotions.

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.080
In this BL world,

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.100
scent can trigger all sorts of things.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
(Beef and Potato Stew Set)

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.200
"A Man Who Defies the World of BL 2024"
(Episode 2)

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:03.570
VS.

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.850
The Scent Chapter

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.990
For example...

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:25.710
Caught a cold?

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:27.840
Um... no...

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:29.250
I just feel a little chilly.

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:34.000
By the way, that shirt...

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:35.400
isn't it a little thin for this weather?

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.430
Wearing something so thin...

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:42.830
Here, put this on, Satoshi.

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.900
I can't.

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.540
But then you'll catch a cold, Atsushi.

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.260
I'm not that weak.

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:49.260
Alright, I'm off to my club activity.

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:56.950
Atsushi.

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:02.570
And just like that...

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.480
a flag was raised.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.160
This is bad.

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:13.810
It's so soft.

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:26.630
It has his scent.

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:30.030
So this is where you were.

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.170
My club activity just finished.

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.930
- Here, you should take this back.
- It's fine.

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:37.420
You can keep it on.

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:45.060
- Atsushi.
- Yeah...

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:48.670
Your scent, Atsushi...

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:51.560
How do I put this...

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:53.840
It's so comforting.

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:55.590
Is it?

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:10.800
And you, Satoshi...

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:14.150
Somehow...

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:17.440
you have a scent that tugs at my heartstrings.

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:21.430
Atsushi...

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:34.700
Sorry.

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:37.570
I might give you my cold.

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:39.520
I already told you...

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:41.970
I'm not that weak.

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:50.530
And so,

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:53.670
with "scent" as the catalyst...

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:55.810
a couple was born.

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:10.050
Hm?

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:14.060
Somebody's got chikuwa in their bento.

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:27.060
Good afternoon~

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:29.590
Chikuwa is the best!

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:31.750
I'm shook!

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:33.860
My jaw is on the floor!

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:37.440
To heck with everything else, outta my way!

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:40.420
Even Prince Shotoku says you gotta eat chikuwa!

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:43.190
Stop it, stop it...

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:44.790
No, I got nothing.

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:46.070
Good afternoon, chikuwa.

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:48.440
And sometimes,

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:49.490
scent...

00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:52.160
in ways you wouldn't expect,

00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:54.330
can reveal certain information.

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:55.820
This scent...

00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:58.590
- Morning.
- Mornin'.

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:02.360
- Morning.
- Mornin'.

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:09.840
They're using the same shampoo.

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:14.310
That's right.

00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:17.110
This is a couple's subtle hint.

00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:18.550
Ooh~

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:20.890
So those two are dating.

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:23.490
We're in college, so...

00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:27.410
it's pretty common to borrow a friend's shower.

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:29.580
But this...

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:32.130
is a BL world, after all.

00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:35.920
Giving off the same shampoo scent
first thing in the morning...

00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:37.210
in other words...

00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:38.780
Which means...

00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:40.990
It tickles...

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:42.950
Don't move.

00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:44.850
I told you.

00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:46.130
I said don't move.

00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:48.410
Okay.

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:52.860
But...

00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:56.290
the fact that you're sensitive even here...

00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:58.920
is also very cute.

00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:09.920
So that's what's going on.

00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:16.210
So cheerful this early in the morning.

00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:18.010
Sigh...

00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:21.000
Since I've picked up on this "hint"...

00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:24.780
I'll perform the most classic NPC move.

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:31.790
Huh?

00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:34.050
Hey you two, are you using the same shampoo?

00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:35.010
Huh?

00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:37.060
Um...

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:38.130
Oh... uh...!

00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:40.090
We were drinking at my place yesterday,

00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:41.640
and he missed the last train.

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:45.310
Yeah, so I ended up crashing at his place for the night.

00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:48.890
Oh, but we slept in separate beds, of course.

00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:50.650
Right, right, don't get the wrong idea.

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:55.230
As if I would.

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:01.190
Bringing up the sleeping arrangements unprompted...

00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:02.360
They're totally flustered.

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:03.660
Yep, that confirms it.

00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:10.860
By the way,

00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:13.470
that shampoo smells really nice.

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:22.350
As a result,

00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:25.740
because I just had to go
and make that unnecessary NPC move,

00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:27.070
one day,

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:29.960
divine punishment came for me.

00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:33.750
Those two went public with their relationship.

00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:41.830
Huh?

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:44.280
Your shampoo scent...

00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:45.760
I feel like I've smelled it somewhere before.

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:46.550
Huh?

00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:48.100
Oh, you're right.

00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:51.720
Oh.

00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:53.210
So that's where it's coming from.

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:54.340
Huh?

00:10:55.510 --> 00:10:57.050
Ah... um...

00:10:57.660 --> 00:10:58.660
That is...

00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:00.590
Lavender...

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:01.900
Bergamot...

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:03.500
Chamomile...

00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:05.450
And ylang-ylang.

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:15.230
You two smell the same.

00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:16.010
Huh?

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:17.600
Don't tell me...

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:19.350
Did you spend the night together?

00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:22.280
And that's why you're using the same shampoo?

00:11:22.690 --> 00:11:23.890
Ah, no no no no...

00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:25.490
Uh... No way!

00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:27.720
I use a common shampoo you can find anywhere.

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:28.480
That's not it.

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:31.470
My shampoo is a limited edition from a boutique.

00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:32.200
Huh?

00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:35.270
Why...

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:38.930
Why am I using the same limited-edition product as this guy?

00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:41.570
Aah!

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:47.330
Oh?

00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:48.530
I won!

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:51.880
Whoa, so refreshing.

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:53.880
Oh?

00:11:55.850 --> 00:11:57.050
What's that smell?

00:11:57.230 --> 00:11:58.430
Oh, this?

00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:02.240
It's the shampoo Tojo gave me. Smells great, right?

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:04.630
You are absolutely forbidden from using it, bro.

00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:07.370
- I'm cherishing this stuff.
- As if I'd use it.

00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:11.610
Or so I said...

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:14.020
but like a total cliché, I went and used it secretly anyway.

00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:16.460
So is this my karma?

00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:19.370
To think that...

00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:22.240
someone else is using the exact same shampoo.

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:26.140
Maybe this is some kind of fate.

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:26.890
Huh...

00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:28.710
Why don't you just start dating?

00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:31.740
- Yeah, just get together already!
- Stop trying to pair us up!

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:38.640
Even though our shampoo is the same...

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:41.220
our scents are a little different.

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:42.100
Huh?

00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:44.070
The shampoo,

00:12:44.290 --> 00:12:46.320
mixed with your own scent,

00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:48.610
has created an even better fragrance.

00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:53.240
Uh... um... well...

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:54.640
What do I do?

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:56.120
What do I do?

00:12:56.390 --> 00:12:57.390
What am I supposed to do?

00:12:58.010 --> 00:12:59.010
I know!

00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:01.520
Ah... Achoo!

00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:02.590
What's wrong?

00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:04.100
Are you catching a cold? Want to borrow my jacket?

00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:05.360
Oh, it's not a cold.

00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:07.510
Oh!

00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:09.580
It's this, this scent!

00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:11.800
I think whenever I smell this scent...

00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:13.560
I start sneezing.

00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:14.990
It's probably some kind of allergy.

00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:16.420
I guess we're just not a good match.

00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:17.540
So, that's that.

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:18.540
See you around.

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:24.760
Excellent.

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:26.810
Beautifully dismantled that flag.

00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:28.270
That's me, all right.

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:29.800
The one and only...

00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:31.080
King of the NPCs.

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:34.980
Hey, bro.

00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:37.350
Have you been using my shampoo?

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:38.790
Pay me back for it.

00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:39.910
No.

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:40.920
I didn't use it.

00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:45.040
Yes, you did.

00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:47.270
No, I didn't.

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:49.760
Is it expensive?

00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:52.090
It's a limited edition. They don't sell it in stores anymore.

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:54.030
It costs 20,000 online.

00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:55.350
What? 20,000!

00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:58.920
- Please, I'm begging you.
- I only used my bottle once.

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:02.450
Oh, give me a break.
Hey, you can have this one!

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.370
I don't want it.

00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:08.020
- Please, Master Ayato~
- Cut it out, hey!

00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:09.130
Let go of me.

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:10.820
- Master Ayato~ Ah!
- I don't need it!

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:14.600
Anyway, "scent."

00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:17.500
So many flags.

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:20.950
That said, using a family member's things without asking...

00:14:20.950 --> 00:14:22.190
is a definite no-go.

00:14:24.210 --> 00:14:30.520
"A Man Who Defies the World of BL 2024"

00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:46.270
In this world of BL manga,

00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:47.820
the age-gap romance

00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:50.760
is a timeless and frequently depicted theme.

00:14:53.010 --> 00:14:54.010
VS

00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:57.930
The Age-Gap Romance Arc

00:14:58.470 --> 00:15:00.560
- Thank you.
- A large bowl of rice, please.

00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:02.210
Not the regular size?

00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:03.060
This is fine, isn't it?

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:06.140
It's super delicious just like this.

00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:08.940
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:11.960
- Rice, large bowl.
- Okay, one large.

00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:20.720
Here you go.

00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:26.370
Just like that,

00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:27.990
if you let your guard down for a second,

00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:31.090
you'll suddenly run into a hot older guy.

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:38.630
Finally finished my paper.

00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:41.680
I'm so tired.

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:42.730
In any case,

00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:47.110
I made it through another day without
getting into an age-gap romance with a hot older guy.

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:49.290
I was heading home safely, but then...

00:15:54.830 --> 00:15:55.580
What's this?

00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:58.480
A middle school girl is crying.

00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:01.670
No, wait.

00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:05.730
In this world, with such well-defined features...

00:16:05.730 --> 00:16:07.210
that means...

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:11.260
he's a middle school boy.

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:16.470
Mister...

00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:22.570
So there's this version of the age-gap romance, too.

00:16:25.170 --> 00:16:26.480
Mister...

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:30.610
What on earth happened to this kid?

00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:34.790
- He may be a middle schooler, but he's still just a kid.
- Mister...

00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:37.020
I can't just leave him here.

00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:39.090
But...

00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:43.160
I just pulled an all-nighter to finish my paper.

00:16:43.530 --> 00:16:45.760
And now I run into a sobbing middle schooler.

00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:48.330
My brain is completely fried.

00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:50.640
I can't think of a good solution.

00:16:52.050 --> 00:16:52.800
In a situation like this...

00:16:53.810 --> 00:16:55.070
Mister...

00:16:55.650 --> 00:16:57.930
Should I use a communication style
that won't raise any flags

00:16:57.930 --> 00:16:59.820
and take him to a police box?

00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:01.130
Ah, no, but...

00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:03.450
that would just make me look even more suspicious.

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:08.270
Oh, right.

00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:18.450
Mister...

00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:35.340
Little lady.

00:17:38.170 --> 00:17:38.930
Huh?

00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:46.630
Sorry.

00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:48.280
My mistake, young man.

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:51.090
What's wrong?

00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:53.100
Did something happen?

00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:56.890
My friend and I...

00:17:57.260 --> 00:17:58.410
got into a fight.

00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:01.440
He said...

00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:03.920
he never wants to see me again.

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:12.920
It's all right.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.460
Mister...

00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:25.280
To put it simply,

00:18:25.670 --> 00:18:28.030
I'm passing this hot potato to
an upperclassman from his school.

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:32.180
I'm sure you two can make up.

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:36.280
I'll go with you to apologize.

00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:41.270
Thank you.

00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:43.480
Mister...

00:18:45.670 --> 00:18:46.830
Calling it "passing the hot potato"

00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:48.950
might sound harsh,

00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:52.360
but I ask you all to take a look at me right now.

00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:55.380
My hair is a mess.

00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:56.830
I have dark circles under my eyes.

00:18:57.220 --> 00:18:58.820
My complexion is terrible.

00:18:59.170 --> 00:19:01.050
I'm in sandals and sweats.

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:04.680
A listless, weird-looking guy like me,

00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:07.850
talking to a kid who at first glance
looks like a beautiful girl...

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.060
what do you think would happen?

00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:12.130
Right, this would happen.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.200
(Report of unwanted advances.
Beware of suspicious individuals.)

00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:17.280
To avoid any unnecessary misunderstandings,

00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:21.010
passing the baton to a clean-cut,
handsome guy like him

00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:23.120
is the best choice.

00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:24.930
Let's go.

00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:27.240
Okay.

00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:42.420
These two...

00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:44.530
had no idea at the time

00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:50.000
that a 25-year-old grad student
and a 13-year-old middle schooler

00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:53.650
would one day overcome their 12-year age gap

00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:55.950
and become lovers.

00:19:57.470 --> 00:19:58.840
I wish you happiness,

00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:01.460
you future lovebirds.

00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:06.720
Um...

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:10.750
What are you muttering to yourself about?

00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:14.180
Oh, it's nothing.

00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:17.780
That was close.

00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:19.280
I almost ended up looking like a creep.

00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:21.020
But this time,

00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:23.030
I managed to dodge another flag beautifully.

00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:24.780
However,

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:26.380
at that moment,

00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:27.840
I had yet to realize

00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:30.920
the fateful

00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:32.120
age-gap romance

00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:34.140
that was about to befall me.

00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:37.080
Could it be possible...

00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:39.170
that person is...

00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:44.230
Paper's done.

00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:46.790
Time to hurry home and play some games.

00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:49.380
Can't wait.

00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:54.810
Well, well, I, the NPC,

00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:56.940
have once again magnificently dodged a flag.

00:20:58.220 --> 00:20:59.420
Who?

00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:02.130
Why are you staring at me like that?

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:03.640
Huh?

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:05.820
As for the reason, find out next time.

00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:11.700
"A Man Who Defies the World of BL 2024"

00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:42.950
(Next Episode)
I like you.

00:22:43.550 --> 00:22:44.770
I... I like you.

00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:46.860
(vs. The Confession Arc)
It's basically a confession.

00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:49.230
This is the most classic flag of them all.

00:22:49.690 --> 00:22:51.530
You're the only one I like.

00:22:52.010 --> 00:22:53.330
(vs. The Cupid Arc)
As for this confession,

00:22:53.410 --> 00:22:56.320
I have to figure out how to dodge it.

00:22:56.660 --> 00:22:57.440
You two

00:22:57.440 --> 00:23:00.180
just haven't realized your own feelings yet.

00:23:00.610 --> 00:23:02.420
Hateno, go get a haircut.

00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:04.100
Long hair isn't your style, is it?

00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:07.410
There's something I need to talk to you about alone.

00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:09.280
What am I gonna do now?

00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:11.240
What should I do?
