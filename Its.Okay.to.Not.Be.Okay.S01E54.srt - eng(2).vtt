WEBVTT

00:00:01.543 --> 00:00:02.419
Why don't we stop running?

00:00:02.502 --> 00:00:04.212
I'll fight the butterflies for you.

00:00:04.295 --> 00:00:05.588
She's alive, Patrick.

00:00:05.672 --> 00:00:07.632
She's here inside the hospital.

00:00:07.716 --> 00:00:08.883
Your brother saved the day.

00:00:08.967 --> 00:00:12.470
Good thing he was with
Tommy when he had an episode.

00:00:12.554 --> 00:00:15.181
Are you ready to tell us what you saw?

00:00:15.265 --> 00:00:19.185
Mama! Mama!

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:22.981
T-There was a butterfly
pinned on her dress!

00:00:23.064 --> 00:00:26.651
It was like a mommy
butterfly and her baby butterfly!

00:01:39.182 --> 00:01:40.683
Destiny finds us.

00:01:43.812 --> 00:01:46.189
Destiny brings us together.

00:01:46.272 --> 00:01:48.358
When you look at that scar,

00:01:48.441 --> 00:01:51.528
does it not remind
you to stay away from Mia?

00:01:51.611 --> 00:01:55.490
No matter how I try to avoid it,
no matter how much I run…

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.911
Are you saying that this is our destiny?

00:02:00.954 --> 00:02:03.039
That we're not meant to be together?

00:02:05.542 --> 00:02:07.335
Destiny
brought us together again…

00:02:08.962 --> 00:02:11.673
to enlighten us with
the truth that we'd only get hurt.

00:02:15.385 --> 00:02:17.387
M-Matmat
remembers seeing two butterflies.

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.598
O-One big butterfly.

00:02:20.682 --> 00:02:22.225
And one small butterfly.

00:02:23.143 --> 00:02:24.561
They were on top of each other!

00:02:26.437 --> 00:02:27.730
It can't be her.

00:02:30.775 --> 00:02:34.404
Mia's mother can't be
the reason why my life was ruined.

00:02:35.655 --> 00:02:40.076
{\an8}

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.036
{\an8}Am I going to die?

00:02:47.792 --> 00:02:49.043
Mister Samuel…

00:02:49.878 --> 00:02:52.046
{\an8}Is my punishment over?

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.007
{\an8}

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.176
{\an8}The punishment the world gave me.

00:03:06.686 --> 00:03:10.773
{\an8}

00:03:10.857 --> 00:03:11.900
{\an8}Mister Dipong…

00:03:13.818 --> 00:03:15.653
{\an8}You worked with our mother here, right?

00:03:16.738 --> 00:03:18.364
{\an8}What do you know about her?

00:03:18.448 --> 00:03:19.782
{\an8}Was she okay here?

00:03:19.866 --> 00:03:22.285
{\an8}P-Patrick, what do you mean?

00:03:22.368 --> 00:03:25.663
{\an8}Did my mother ever
have a fight with Ma'am Ingrid?

00:03:26.372 --> 00:03:27.665
{\an8}Did you notice anything?

00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:30.043
{\an8}That was a long time ago,
so I can't really remember.

00:03:30.126 --> 00:03:33.546
{\an8}Is that so? Then just tell me,
What was Ma'am Ingrid like as a boss?

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.381
{\an8}Uh…

00:03:36.216 --> 00:03:37.634
{\an8}Did my mother share anything with you?

00:03:37.717 --> 00:03:40.929
{\an8}Most of the time,
I just worked with Sir Samuel.

00:03:41.888 --> 00:03:43.431
{\an8}Tessie was often inside the house,

00:03:43.514 --> 00:03:46.142
{\an8}so I don't really
remember much about her.

00:03:46.226 --> 00:03:47.644
{\an8}Mister Dipong, please have mercy on me.

00:03:47.727 --> 00:03:50.605
{\an8}I just want to find out what
you know about Ma'am Ingrid.

00:03:50.688 --> 00:03:54.943
{\an8}Patrick, I've already
told you everything I know.

00:03:55.568 --> 00:03:56.653
{\an8}I'm sorry.

00:03:57.445 --> 00:04:01.866
{\an8}

00:04:09.207 --> 00:04:11.584
Only this house knows the whole truth.

00:04:19.968 --> 00:04:26.933
{\an8}

00:04:36.567 --> 00:04:37.568
Papa?

00:04:39.904 --> 00:04:41.281
Oh, Mia.

00:04:44.492 --> 00:04:46.077
Where have you been, Papa?

00:04:47.161 --> 00:04:48.329
Well, uh…

00:04:48.413 --> 00:04:52.041
I just took a walk outside.

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:58.506
Were you with Mama?

00:05:01.551 --> 00:05:02.552
No.

00:05:06.973 --> 00:05:09.392
I'm the one who created you.

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.021
I'm the only one who can love you

00:05:13.104 --> 00:05:14.647
and destroy you.

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.775
Do you understand, Mia?

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.069
Yes, Mama.

00:05:20.153 --> 00:05:21.446
No!

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:23.406
- This can't be!
- Papa…

00:05:23.489 --> 00:05:25.283
- I won't allow it!
- Papa, please.

00:05:25.366 --> 00:05:26.576
No!

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:28.286
No! You should die now!

00:05:31.748 --> 00:05:33.958
Mia, just die, please.

00:05:34.042 --> 00:05:35.043
This can't be!

00:05:35.126 --> 00:05:36.544
Just die! No!

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.645
Are you here to take your father out?

00:05:57.607 --> 00:06:00.234
Wouldn't I have gone straight there
if that's what I wanted to do.

00:06:01.652 --> 00:06:02.612
Mia.

00:06:02.695 --> 00:06:04.155
How much time does he have left?

00:06:08.284 --> 00:06:09.285
To tell you the truth…

00:06:10.244 --> 00:06:12.497
he could be gone anytime now.

00:06:16.876 --> 00:06:18.669
I've heard that so many times.

00:06:19.837 --> 00:06:23.049
Yet here we are, after so many years…

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:25.676
and he's still alive.

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:28.513
Mia, this is for real.

00:06:29.097 --> 00:06:30.640
He can no longer undergo surgery.

00:06:34.268 --> 00:06:35.645
It's just sad that…

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:39.440
Mister Samuel is just
waiting for his time to come.

00:06:42.944 --> 00:06:45.238
Is that why you want
me to change my mind?

00:06:45.947 --> 00:06:48.658
Because he doesn't
have much time left on earth?

00:06:49.075 --> 00:06:50.660
Mia, you're family.

00:06:50.743 --> 00:06:53.454
That's nothing but
obligation and blood ties.

00:06:53.538 --> 00:06:57.166
Not once have I ever
felt that we were truly family.

00:06:58.501 --> 00:06:59.627
So, now…

00:07:00.378 --> 00:07:03.422
I'm choosing who I want as my family.

00:07:05.466 --> 00:07:06.968
Mia, just this once…

00:07:08.636 --> 00:07:10.054
be with him.

00:07:10.138 --> 00:07:11.764
You two can sit here in the garden.

00:07:13.307 --> 00:07:14.767
I hope you understand.

00:07:20.231 --> 00:07:21.315
No, Gemma.

00:07:22.608 --> 00:07:23.609
I don't want to.

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:28.114
I hope you understand.

00:07:39.709 --> 00:07:41.085
I know what you're thinking.

00:07:41.836 --> 00:07:44.172
You want to rub it in
my face that I was wrong.

00:07:44.255 --> 00:07:46.924
That Mia is going
to spend time with her father.

00:07:51.095 --> 00:07:52.805
I don't have to rub it in your face.

00:07:54.348 --> 00:07:58.978
Because from the very start I knew,
your idea was a mistake.

00:07:59.061 --> 00:08:01.355
As long as Samuel is alive,

00:08:02.482 --> 00:08:03.483
I know…

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.402
their family will be complete again.

00:08:08.237 --> 00:08:09.530
So, you're saying…

00:08:10.448 --> 00:08:12.033
Mia's mother will return?

00:08:12.783 --> 00:08:14.243
All these years,

00:08:14.327 --> 00:08:17.121
they never found Ingrid's body.

00:08:19.207 --> 00:08:20.208
Is that all?

00:08:22.126 --> 00:08:26.047
You just really love
finding faults in me, don't you?

00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:28.090
- You shouldn't be--
- Getting involved?

00:08:29.717 --> 00:08:32.470
Olivia, this is a patient concern.

00:08:33.095 --> 00:08:35.556
And I'm not overstepping any authority.

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:37.850
But that also doesn't mean
I'm letting this go

00:08:37.934 --> 00:08:40.144
because you are just power-tripping!

00:08:40.228 --> 00:08:41.312
Power-tripping?

00:08:41.395 --> 00:08:44.398
What power-tripping are you talking about?
I'm not even your manager yet.

00:08:44.482 --> 00:08:47.026
I'm not going to wait
for you to be my superior

00:08:47.109 --> 00:08:49.403
because even now,
you don't deserve the respect!

00:08:49.487 --> 00:08:51.864
- Respect?
- Yes, respect!

00:08:51.948 --> 00:08:53.783
Eden! Olivia!

00:08:59.997 --> 00:09:02.792
Did the kid and Tommy
experience the same thing?

00:09:04.043 --> 00:09:06.629
M-Mister Tommy said

00:09:06.712 --> 00:09:09.840
he's stuck in the past,

00:09:09.924 --> 00:09:12.426
just like the kid in the book.

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:14.595
So, Matmat thought

00:09:14.679 --> 00:09:17.640
Mister Tommy should read the book, too.

00:09:18.516 --> 00:09:22.520
Good job, Matmat! I'm so proud of you!

00:09:23.145 --> 00:09:24.647
You're proud of me, Mama Li?

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:26.857
T-Thank you, Mama Li.

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:28.442
Me too, Matmat.

00:09:29.235 --> 00:09:30.278
I'm also proud of you.

00:09:31.153 --> 00:09:32.905
I heard about what you did.

00:09:34.407 --> 00:09:37.535
M-Mia, greet Mama Li.

00:09:38.452 --> 00:09:39.453
Why?

00:09:40.913 --> 00:09:42.123
Did she help you?

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:47.670
We should respect
people who are older than us.

00:09:50.756 --> 00:09:51.841
Hello.

00:09:53.009 --> 00:09:54.093
Say "ma'am."

00:09:55.761 --> 00:09:56.679
Hello, ma'am.

00:09:57.013 --> 00:09:58.264
Hello, Mia.

00:09:59.765 --> 00:10:00.850
Matmat.

00:10:01.559 --> 00:10:03.269
We should celebrate.

00:10:03.352 --> 00:10:05.354
Come on, let's go out.

00:10:06.522 --> 00:10:09.692
I-It's not yet Matmat's birthday.

00:10:09.775 --> 00:10:11.861
My birthday is on May 16.

00:10:12.903 --> 00:10:15.531
Birthdays are not the only
occasions we should celebrate.

00:10:15.615 --> 00:10:17.199
You did a good job.

00:10:17.283 --> 00:10:19.118
So, we should celebrate.

00:10:19.201 --> 00:10:20.786
It's just a waste of money.

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:24.540
L-Let's just celebrate at home, Mia.

00:10:24.624 --> 00:10:28.753
But I want a change of environment,
Matmat. So come on, let's eat out.

00:10:30.838 --> 00:10:35.551
Matmat said we should
respect people who are older than us.

00:10:35.635 --> 00:10:37.970
You're not listening
to your older brother.

00:10:38.054 --> 00:10:41.974
You two act like real siblings.

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:43.434
No, Mama Li.

00:10:43.517 --> 00:10:46.896
Matmat and Patpat's surname is…

00:10:48.189 --> 00:10:49.190
Gonzales.

00:10:49.273 --> 00:10:52.943
Mia has a different surname.
She's Mia Hernandez.

00:10:53.027 --> 00:10:55.237
We're not related by blood.

00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:58.532
Matmat, you can choose your family.

00:10:59.742 --> 00:11:03.704
And that's why I choose
you and Patrick to be my family.

00:11:04.372 --> 00:11:06.791
Y-You can choose your family?

00:11:06.874 --> 00:11:07.750
Yes.

00:11:07.833 --> 00:11:09.460
What other proof do you need?

00:11:10.795 --> 00:11:12.046
I have an idea.

00:11:12.838 --> 00:11:14.465
Let's take a family picture.

00:11:15.716 --> 00:11:19.303
I-If we take a picture together,
we can be a family?

00:11:19.387 --> 00:11:22.139
I'm so excited.

00:11:22.223 --> 00:11:23.933
I'll pick our outfits.

00:11:24.016 --> 00:11:26.268
M-Matmat will pick his own outfit.

00:11:26.727 --> 00:11:28.437
Matmat, I will pick our outfits.

00:11:29.021 --> 00:11:31.816
Two butterflies
on top of each other.

00:11:32.858 --> 00:11:34.068
It was a brooch.

00:11:36.946 --> 00:11:38.447
If it really was hers,

00:11:39.156 --> 00:11:40.699
then she probably left it with Mia.

00:13:11.332 --> 00:13:13.876
"Shadows Behind the New Face:

00:13:14.919 --> 00:13:17.463
The Fifth Book of the Witch's Life."

00:13:26.347 --> 00:13:28.724
Why did
Patrick suddenly ask about that?

00:13:39.985 --> 00:13:41.195
Pick up.

00:13:42.112 --> 00:13:43.864
You need to hear this.

00:13:47.868 --> 00:13:49.078
Hello?

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:52.456
Okay.

00:13:53.582 --> 00:13:55.417
Don't stay out too late, okay?

00:13:56.585 --> 00:13:57.962
Be careful on your way home.

00:14:00.005 --> 00:14:01.131
Okay.

00:14:10.724 --> 00:14:13.561
I'll be here for
you until your last breath.

00:14:22.194 --> 00:14:23.821
"To the witch,

00:14:23.904 --> 00:14:27.575
low-class people
have no place in this world.

00:14:28.409 --> 00:14:32.413
Those slaves,
who think their voices matter.

00:14:33.914 --> 00:14:35.583
The witch said:

00:14:36.584 --> 00:14:39.169
Even if I disappear or are buried,

00:14:39.712 --> 00:14:42.965
the invasive slave
won't be able to escape.

00:14:43.048 --> 00:14:45.926
The slave who appears at dawn

00:14:46.010 --> 00:14:49.138
will be erased from
the world by my hands."

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:55.644
A slave who appears at dawn?

00:14:58.564 --> 00:15:00.524
The witch killed the slave?

00:15:03.444 --> 00:15:05.571
Did Ma'am Ingrid write
about what she had done?

00:15:08.699 --> 00:15:10.826
What kind of person are you?

00:15:15.122 --> 00:15:16.999
Doc, you're looking for me?

00:15:17.082 --> 00:15:19.126
Thank you for coming back, Olivia.

00:15:19.209 --> 00:15:21.629
I know you've
already clocked out for today.

00:15:22.588 --> 00:15:23.923
Take a seat.

00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:32.723
Doc, if this is about the fight
you saw between Eden and me,

00:15:32.806 --> 00:15:34.224
I'm sorry.

00:15:35.225 --> 00:15:36.644
Uh…

00:15:36.727 --> 00:15:38.354
I just lost control of my emotions,

00:15:38.437 --> 00:15:40.397
but it won't happen again.

00:15:42.441 --> 00:15:44.276
No harm done, Doc.

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:46.904
This is how Olivia and I actually work.

00:15:46.987 --> 00:15:49.281
That's why we should change that now.

00:15:50.532 --> 00:15:52.159
I've already decided,

00:15:53.035 --> 00:15:57.206
who among you I'll
promote to nurse manager.

00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:07.049
"A slave dirtier than mud
is easier still to erase from this world."

00:16:09.885 --> 00:16:13.347
"Disgraceful was
the slave with two children,

00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:15.641
both born male."

00:16:23.816 --> 00:16:28.487
"The older son had special
needs and was mentally deficient,

00:16:28.570 --> 00:16:31.323
while the younger son,
though normal, was like his mother.

00:16:31.407 --> 00:16:34.910
He was dirty and disgraceful
in his desire to befriend

00:16:34.994 --> 00:16:37.830
the witch's most treasured possession…

00:16:38.747 --> 00:16:41.125
her one and only princess."

00:16:51.677 --> 00:16:53.554
"The witch emerged victorious.

00:16:54.847 --> 00:16:56.724
The slave was gone from this world.

00:16:57.307 --> 00:17:00.978
She carried out the second phase
of her gruesome plan.

00:17:01.645 --> 00:17:04.940
It's to change her form and identity,

00:17:06.066 --> 00:17:10.612
while watching her former
life partner die in agony."

00:17:12.489 --> 00:17:14.074
To change her form?

00:17:16.827 --> 00:17:18.620
To change her identity?

00:17:23.417 --> 00:17:29.673
Patpat, Matmat,
and Mia are taking a family picture.

00:17:30.132 --> 00:17:31.091
Patrick?

00:17:31.175 --> 00:17:33.427
Matmat just needs to pick his clothes.

00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:34.636
Patrick.

00:17:48.692 --> 00:17:49.902
Patrick?

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:52.863
There you are.

00:17:52.946 --> 00:17:54.448
I've been looking for you since earlier.

00:17:54.531 --> 00:17:55.949
I didn't catch you at the hospital,

00:17:56.033 --> 00:17:58.619
and Matmat said he didn't
know where you were either.

00:17:59.912 --> 00:18:03.540
I thought Matmat went
home after his session with Dr. Anok.

00:18:04.792 --> 00:18:05.793
Anyway,

00:18:07.336 --> 00:18:09.254
It's your free day tomorrow, right?

00:18:10.964 --> 00:18:14.301
Let's take a family photo.
The three of us, with Matmat.

00:18:15.803 --> 00:18:18.180
I found a photographer
who can take our photo.

00:18:19.807 --> 00:18:21.016
I'll just go check on Matmat.

00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:23.894
Hey! It was hard
enough convincing Matmat.

00:18:23.977 --> 00:18:25.771
He might change his mind.

00:18:25.854 --> 00:18:26.980
Next time, Mia.

00:18:27.606 --> 00:18:29.775
No. I already booked the photographer.

00:18:30.317 --> 00:18:31.318
Mia…

00:18:33.028 --> 00:18:34.029
I don't want to.

00:18:36.865 --> 00:18:37.825
You don't?

00:18:41.703 --> 00:18:43.122
I'll just go check on Matmat.

00:18:49.169 --> 00:18:50.754
He's avoiding me again.

00:19:15.904 --> 00:19:18.323
Patpat, how long have you been there?

00:19:20.367 --> 00:19:24.830
Are you going to help
Matmat pick out clothes?

00:19:24.913 --> 00:19:30.961
Mia said we need to look nice.

00:19:31.837 --> 00:19:34.673
Matmat said
we should wear our own clothes,

00:19:34.756 --> 00:19:36.884
but Mia still bought some.

00:19:37.885 --> 00:19:41.054
- Matmat.
- How do you smile?

00:19:41.555 --> 00:19:43.849
Like you said,

00:19:43.932 --> 00:19:47.811
handsome and solid.

00:19:49.563 --> 00:19:50.814
Matmat.

00:19:51.356 --> 00:19:55.903
Patpat's been repeating my name nonstop.

00:19:58.238 --> 00:20:00.157
What's the problem?

00:20:00.699 --> 00:20:04.786
Worrying about what to wear tomorrow?

00:20:08.165 --> 00:20:09.458
Come sit with me.

00:20:19.468 --> 00:20:20.469
Matmat…

00:20:28.727 --> 00:20:30.729
I just want you to know…

00:20:41.823 --> 00:20:43.075
I'm proud of you.

00:20:48.038 --> 00:20:52.417
Proud of Matmat for doing a good job?

00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:56.421
Yes.

00:20:57.798 --> 00:20:59.341
Because you were brave.

00:21:02.177 --> 00:21:06.473
Remember the night
you saw what happened to Mama?

00:21:08.642 --> 00:21:10.435
You faced the butterflies.

00:21:14.606 --> 00:21:15.607
But…

00:21:17.776 --> 00:21:23.240
Matmat still can't draw butterflies.

00:21:24.241 --> 00:21:28.996
That's okay. I believe one
day you'll be able to draw them too.

00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:36.795
Is this the smile I should use

00:21:36.878 --> 00:21:41.216
for our family picture, Patpat?

00:21:48.515 --> 00:21:50.809
Matmat, I'm going
back to the hospital, okay?

00:21:52.686 --> 00:21:55.856
It's getting late and you're going back?

00:21:56.356 --> 00:21:58.275
I forgot to do something.

00:22:15.667 --> 00:22:17.377
What's wrong with you, Patrick?

00:22:23.759 --> 00:22:27.220
Is he mad at me?

00:22:27.971 --> 00:22:29.097
But why?

00:22:29.806 --> 00:22:31.266
What did I do this time?

00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:34.102
No.

00:22:34.811 --> 00:22:36.104
I didn't do anything.

00:22:39.357 --> 00:22:41.568
Something happened at the hospital.

00:22:46.907 --> 00:22:48.658
You're killing me, Patrick!

00:22:50.035 --> 00:22:52.996
You can't look like that
in the family photo.

00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:55.749
I won't take no for an answer. I won't!

00:22:57.876 --> 00:22:59.211
Uh…

00:22:59.294 --> 00:23:01.880
So writers really do talk to themselves?

00:23:02.881 --> 00:23:04.007
What's wrong with Patrick?

00:23:04.883 --> 00:23:05.926
Um…

00:23:06.802 --> 00:23:09.721
First of all, you should lock the gate.

00:23:09.805 --> 00:23:12.641
It's late,
and I got in without any trouble.

00:23:12.724 --> 00:23:13.975
I unlocked it for you.

00:23:14.059 --> 00:23:15.852
And second, did you need this many?

00:23:16.228 --> 00:23:18.063
All of these? Look how many!

00:23:18.146 --> 00:23:20.899
You could've just texted me.
My phone's right here.

00:23:20.982 --> 00:23:23.443
We have each other's numbers,
or you could've emailed me.

00:23:23.527 --> 00:23:24.861
Don't you want to earn money?

00:23:25.862 --> 00:23:27.614
Well, I do believe
that the best customer service

00:23:27.697 --> 00:23:29.407
is hand-delivering orders personally,

00:23:29.491 --> 00:23:31.868
so I don't mind
doing this from time to time.

00:23:31.952 --> 00:23:33.703
So, how can I serve you today, ma'am?

00:23:35.455 --> 00:23:37.749
What's wrong with Patrick?

00:23:39.292 --> 00:23:40.794
Uh, many things.

00:23:40.877 --> 00:23:43.171
He's resilient to a fault.

00:23:43.255 --> 00:23:46.258
His face card is unreal.
I mean, you've seen him.

00:23:46.341 --> 00:23:48.009
Sometimes,
I can't believe he's that handsome.

00:23:48.093 --> 00:23:49.427
Ugh! That's not what I mean!

00:23:49.511 --> 00:23:52.889
I mean, what's wrong with Patrick today?

00:23:52.973 --> 00:23:54.141
Oh, today?

00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:56.935
I haven't talked
to him today, so I don't know.

00:23:57.435 --> 00:23:58.812
But you're his best friend.

00:23:58.895 --> 00:24:00.313
You should know what's upsetting him.

00:24:00.397 --> 00:24:03.066
Yes, yes, yes.
I know I'm his best friend, okay?

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:06.778
That's why I know that if
something's bothering him

00:24:06.862 --> 00:24:09.322
or if he's worried or hurt,

00:24:09.406 --> 00:24:11.158
he won't talk to anyone about it.

00:24:12.492 --> 00:24:13.827
Frustrating, right?

00:24:13.910 --> 00:24:15.829
He has a bad habit
of hiding his feelings.

00:24:19.624 --> 00:24:21.042
He's so great at it,

00:24:22.377 --> 00:24:26.006
that no one or nothing can force him

00:24:26.089 --> 00:24:28.633
to share whatever
goes on in his mind and heart.

00:24:29.426 --> 00:24:31.720
So the only thing I can do as his friend

00:24:32.929 --> 00:24:34.890
is be there for him

00:24:35.265 --> 00:24:37.017
in case he needs…

00:24:38.768 --> 00:24:39.811
someone.

00:24:40.645 --> 00:24:42.814
You have to wait until he opens up.

00:24:44.608 --> 00:24:48.653
You see,
when he and Matmat became orphans,

00:24:50.155 --> 00:24:53.950
he had no one
to talk to about his struggles.

00:24:55.535 --> 00:24:57.495
So he just kept them to himself.

00:25:00.123 --> 00:25:02.667
From a young age, he learned to…

00:25:03.877 --> 00:25:05.420
…bottle things up.

00:25:10.550 --> 00:25:13.178
He's been through so much in life.

00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:43.875
Attorney, I know so much time has passed,

00:25:45.752 --> 00:25:48.964
but I want to seek
justice for my mother's death.

00:25:49.965 --> 00:25:53.301
I understand how you feel

00:25:53.385 --> 00:25:56.680
because you learned some new information.

00:25:57.681 --> 00:26:01.184
But Patrick, we need strong
evidence to reopen the case.

00:26:02.644 --> 00:26:04.229
My brother, Matmat.

00:26:04.312 --> 00:26:07.315
Can he testify as
witness even if he has autism?

00:26:08.316 --> 00:26:09.734
Of course.

00:26:09.818 --> 00:26:14.656
If the testimony of
a person with disability is coherent,

00:26:15.073 --> 00:26:17.492
it is admissible in court.

00:26:19.911 --> 00:26:21.121
Okay.

00:26:23.790 --> 00:26:28.211
Okay, I'll ask my
brother to testify in Mama's case.

00:26:29.337 --> 00:26:33.842
But can he say
that it was really Ingrid Hernandez

00:26:33.925 --> 00:26:37.887
he saw at the scene
of the crime at that time?

00:26:37.971 --> 00:26:41.516
That he saw Hernandez's face?

00:26:43.018 --> 00:26:46.146
He said he saw a butterfly broach.

00:26:46.229 --> 00:26:49.190
I saw a picture of her wearing it.

00:26:49.649 --> 00:26:51.651
If that was really Ingrid's,

00:26:51.735 --> 00:26:56.114
is your brother sure
that it was her was wearing it

00:26:56.197 --> 00:26:59.826
at the time and place
that the crime happened?

00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:04.331
Attorney, she killed Mama.
She even wrote it in her book.

00:27:05.123 --> 00:27:06.958
But it's a book of fiction.

00:27:09.544 --> 00:27:10.795
And it doesn't help

00:27:10.879 --> 00:27:14.215
that the person
you want to file a case against

00:27:14.299 --> 00:27:16.760
is already dead in the eyes of the law.

00:27:19.054 --> 00:27:21.973
I strongly believe that she is alive.

00:27:22.724 --> 00:27:23.892
That's another thing.

00:27:24.851 --> 00:27:28.271
Ingrid Hernandez is a known personality.

00:27:28.355 --> 00:27:29.522
If she's still alive,

00:27:29.898 --> 00:27:31.399
where is she?

00:27:31.483 --> 00:27:32.650
But…

00:27:35.612 --> 00:27:38.198
what if she changed her face?
Had plastic surgery?

00:27:38.281 --> 00:27:39.616
That's possible, right?

00:27:40.617 --> 00:27:43.912
Then we need
to prove that Ingrid Hernandez

00:27:43.995 --> 00:27:47.415
and that person are one and the same.

00:27:49.292 --> 00:27:51.002
Can you do that, Patrick?

00:28:12.023 --> 00:28:14.442
- I want to take this family picture.
- Mia, please. Not now.

00:28:14.526 --> 00:28:16.778
Not now, or never?

00:28:16.861 --> 00:28:18.530
You two are my family.

00:28:18.613 --> 00:28:20.949
Family help each other out.

00:28:21.032 --> 00:28:24.285
I'm tired of taking
care of people around me.

00:28:24.369 --> 00:28:27.122
I can't forgive her. I'll make her pay.

00:28:27.205 --> 00:28:29.791
That butterfly ruined our lives.

00:28:29.874 --> 00:28:31.960
She's right here, inside the hospital.

00:28:32.043 --> 00:28:33.503
I need to find her, Mia,

00:28:33.586 --> 00:28:35.755
whether she's in
the hospital or somewhere else.
