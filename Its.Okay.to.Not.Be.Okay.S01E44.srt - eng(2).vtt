WEBVTT

00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:05.839
Matmat, sorry if I thought,
it'd be better if you just died.

00:00:06.464 --> 00:00:08.508
I'm sorry I lied to you.

00:00:08.591 --> 00:00:10.552
It's just the two of us.

00:00:10.635 --> 00:00:13.388
Yes. Just Matmat and Patpat, right?

00:00:13.471 --> 00:00:14.681
How long will you keep waiting

00:00:14.764 --> 00:00:18.101
when there's no guarantee
if they'll ever be ready?

00:00:18.184 --> 00:00:19.561
Patience is not about waiting.

00:00:19.644 --> 00:00:22.814
It's how you're waiting
and who you're waiting for.

00:00:22.897 --> 00:00:26.776
You're the worst and
most evil of all villains!

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:27.902
Ow!

00:00:27.986 --> 00:00:29.154
You're cute.

00:00:29.237 --> 00:00:30.780
I know I'm cute.

00:00:30.864 --> 00:00:33.491
But the boy I like
doesn't like cute girls.

00:00:33.575 --> 00:00:35.744
Why does Patrick even like you?

00:00:35.827 --> 00:00:37.746
You're cute, but I'm pretty.

00:00:38.997 --> 00:00:40.373
How dare you!

00:00:41.916 --> 00:00:43.084
I hope that hurt.

00:01:38.556 --> 00:01:40.350
Mia? Mia?

00:01:41.267 --> 00:01:42.268
Gemma?

00:01:43.478 --> 00:01:44.479
Mia?

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:47.190
{\an8}Gemma? Mia?

00:01:47.273 --> 00:01:48.608
{\an8}Gemma?

00:01:48.691 --> 00:01:49.609
{\an8}Mia!

00:01:49.692 --> 00:01:50.944
{\an8}Where's Gemma?

00:01:52.737 --> 00:01:53.613
{\an8}Gemma?

00:01:53.696 --> 00:01:55.031
{\an8}What did you do to her?

00:01:55.115 --> 00:01:56.449
{\an8}Why are you blaming me?

00:01:56.533 --> 00:01:58.034
{\an8}She did that to herself.

00:01:58.743 --> 00:02:00.829
{\an8}Gemma? Are you okay?

00:02:00.912 --> 00:02:01.955
{\an8}Gemma?

00:02:02.288 --> 00:02:03.748
{\an8}You really like her.

00:02:03.832 --> 00:02:04.833
{\an8}Yes!

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.460
{\an8}Wow, straight to the point.

00:02:08.336 --> 00:02:11.965
{\an8}Mia, why should I beat
around the bush?

00:02:12.048 --> 00:02:14.467
{\an8}- Careful.

00:02:14.551 --> 00:02:16.094
{\an8}Who do you like more?

00:02:16.511 --> 00:02:18.012
{\an8}Me or her?

00:02:18.096 --> 00:02:21.141
{\an8}-

00:02:21.224 --> 00:02:24.435
{\an8}I like you both in different ways.

00:02:24.894 --> 00:02:28.398
{\an8}Who's your number one? Gemma or me?

00:02:29.065 --> 00:02:32.277
{\an8}You're practically
asking the same question.

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.196
{\an8}Besides, you shouldn't be doing that, Mia.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.198
{\an8}You shouldn't rate a person

00:02:37.282 --> 00:02:39.617
{\an8}or measure their worth with numbers.

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:41.744
{\an8}And one more thing,

00:02:41.828 --> 00:02:44.080
{\an8}feelings are like colors.

00:02:44.164 --> 00:02:47.083
{\an8}Different shades,
yet all belonging to one family.

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:49.502
{\an8}Just take pink for example.

00:02:49.586 --> 00:02:52.505
{\an8}There's carnation pink,
baby pink, rose pink.

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:56.467
{\an8}There's anger, rage, and hatred.

00:02:56.551 --> 00:03:00.013
{\an8}There's happiness, delight, and euphoria.

00:03:01.306 --> 00:03:02.307
{\an8}Get it?

00:03:03.057 --> 00:03:06.311
{\an8}They're on the same spectrum,
just different shades.

00:03:07.478 --> 00:03:09.606
{\an8}Say what you want,

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:13.610
{\an8}but when you mix all those
shades together, all you end up with is

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:16.029
{\an8}the color black.

00:03:17.071 --> 00:03:18.197
{\an8}Tell me, Vincent.

00:03:19.032 --> 00:03:20.700
{\an8}Do you like that color?

00:03:20.783 --> 00:03:22.452
{\an8}Do you want that emotion?

00:03:22.535 --> 00:03:23.369
{\an8}

00:03:23.453 --> 00:03:27.665
{\an8}

00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:29.375
{\an8}Be honest, Mia.

00:03:30.501 --> 00:03:32.170
{\an8}Are you acting like this…

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:36.841
because Patrick no
longer lives in the mansion?

00:03:38.343 --> 00:03:40.261
What does it feel like

00:03:40.345 --> 00:03:42.597
being alone here now?

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:43.681
Hmm?

00:03:44.265 --> 00:03:46.017
- Tell me.
- Never mind.

00:03:47.143 --> 00:03:48.144
I'm fine.

00:03:55.318 --> 00:03:56.319
I just…

00:03:57.862 --> 00:03:59.864
I just get irritated more easily.

00:04:00.907 --> 00:04:02.408
And I

00:04:02.492 --> 00:04:04.160
feel cold at night.

00:04:06.246 --> 00:04:07.956
I get hungry all the time.

00:04:08.414 --> 00:04:09.666
It's weird.

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:10.583
Ha!

00:04:11.542 --> 00:04:12.877
You know what that is?

00:04:13.962 --> 00:04:15.213
That's what you call,

00:04:15.922 --> 00:04:17.298
missing them.

00:04:18.132 --> 00:04:20.969
You're missing Patrick.

00:04:22.929 --> 00:04:25.390
Gemma? Let's go home.

00:04:26.391 --> 00:04:28.935
I'll carry you, but be careful.

00:05:32.206 --> 00:05:34.167
Don't help him.

00:05:41.174 --> 00:05:42.175
Help him.

00:05:44.844 --> 00:05:46.387
Don't help him.

00:05:47.221 --> 00:05:48.347
Help him.

00:05:56.481 --> 00:05:58.566
Don't help him.

00:09:10.883 --> 00:09:11.884
Mia!

00:09:37.076 --> 00:09:40.329
So, do you still like me?

00:10:49.357 --> 00:10:52.151
You need to leave and never come back.

00:10:52.985 --> 00:10:55.196
- But…
- I said leave!

00:10:55.279 --> 00:10:57.865
And this is the last
time we will see each other.

00:11:31.107 --> 00:11:32.566
Do I miss him?

00:11:37.071 --> 00:11:39.198
What if I come with you?

00:11:43.577 --> 00:11:45.079
And have a good time.

00:11:47.706 --> 00:11:49.291
What do you want to eat?

00:11:49.375 --> 00:11:50.376
You.

00:11:53.879 --> 00:11:55.631
What do you want to eat?

00:11:57.883 --> 00:11:59.093
I love you!

00:12:01.554 --> 00:12:03.472
I love you, Patrick!

00:12:05.266 --> 00:12:06.976
I've been cutting Matmat's hair

00:12:07.059 --> 00:12:08.894
since I was a teenager.

00:12:08.978 --> 00:12:11.397
Because you're
the only one who can touch his head.

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:13.482
You have nothing to worry about

00:12:13.566 --> 00:12:15.025
because after this…

00:12:15.109 --> 00:12:17.194
I'm going to look like Matmat?

00:12:17.611 --> 00:12:19.321
If you want to.

00:12:30.749 --> 00:12:31.750
Their beautiful.

00:12:34.128 --> 00:12:35.421
Just like you.

00:13:08.829 --> 00:13:09.914
He's right.

00:13:12.666 --> 00:13:14.210
I do miss him.

00:13:21.717 --> 00:13:27.139
I really, really miss you, Patrick.

00:13:43.239 --> 00:13:44.782
Gemma Lyn Marie,

00:13:45.449 --> 00:13:46.617
never again.

00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:50.996
Patrick.

00:13:51.622 --> 00:13:53.207
- Hey.
- You're up early.

00:13:53.666 --> 00:13:55.334
What time did you get home last night?

00:13:58.295 --> 00:13:59.505
Pretty early.

00:14:00.172 --> 00:14:01.549
How's your stomach?

00:14:02.258 --> 00:14:03.259
Huh?

00:14:04.093 --> 00:14:06.136
Your stomach. Is it good now?

00:14:07.346 --> 00:14:08.347
Why?

00:14:09.848 --> 00:14:12.476
You don't
remember what happened last night?

00:14:14.645 --> 00:14:15.771
Last night?

00:14:15.854 --> 00:14:16.855
Mm-hmm.

00:14:18.857 --> 00:14:21.110
- Vincent, take her to her room.
- No!

00:14:21.193 --> 00:14:23.737
- No! Take me to the kitchen!
- Huh?

00:14:23.821 --> 00:14:26.073
- The kitchen?
- The kitchen.

00:14:26.156 --> 00:14:28.576
I still want to drink!

00:14:28.659 --> 00:14:31.203
Stop squirming, or I'll drop you!

00:14:31.287 --> 00:14:32.538
No…

00:14:32.621 --> 00:14:36.667
- Gemma!
- I still want to drink.

00:14:37.626 --> 00:14:39.169
- Be careful.

00:14:42.715 --> 00:14:44.425
How much did you drink?

00:14:45.509 --> 00:14:47.636
- I don't know.
-…in the car, right?

00:14:53.183 --> 00:14:54.184
Patrick!

00:14:54.268 --> 00:14:55.269
Hey.

00:14:56.353 --> 00:14:59.189
- You son of a--
- Why are you up?

00:14:59.273 --> 00:15:00.983
- Enough.

00:15:01.066 --> 00:15:02.943
Pokemon. She meant to say Pokemon.

00:15:06.822 --> 00:15:10.492
You son of a beach!

00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:12.995
Gemma! Enough.

00:15:13.078 --> 00:15:14.830
You did that on purpose.

00:15:14.914 --> 00:15:19.168
That favor you asked me was for yourself!

00:15:20.753 --> 00:15:22.546
Gemma, I don't understand.

00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:26.592
You meant for me to go see Mia, huh?

00:15:27.551 --> 00:15:29.720
So we could reconcile?

00:15:29.803 --> 00:15:31.889
Let me go!

00:15:31.972 --> 00:15:33.432
Patrick, she woke up today

00:15:33.515 --> 00:15:35.225
- and chose violence.
- Let go of me--

00:15:35.309 --> 00:15:36.852
The neighbors might hear you!

00:15:36.936 --> 00:15:38.437
- Ow! Ow! Ow!

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:39.730
That hurt!

00:15:41.023 --> 00:15:44.276
- You like the Gemma who acts like a baby?!
-

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:48.155
You know that I'm
still trying to move on, right?

00:15:48.238 --> 00:15:53.911
All you think about is Mia, Mia, Mia!

00:15:53.994 --> 00:15:56.205
- You treat Mia that way!
- Gemma.

00:15:56.288 --> 00:15:58.707
- Gemma.
- You're so unfair!

00:15:59.124 --> 00:16:01.335
Please sit down. I'll get you some water.

00:16:01.418 --> 00:16:02.336
Vincent.

00:16:03.754 --> 00:16:05.965
Come on. Sit down.

00:16:06.048 --> 00:16:07.716
I'll just get you some water, okay?

00:16:11.011 --> 00:16:12.888
- I'll take you to your room--

00:16:12.972 --> 00:16:14.807
- Are you okay?

00:16:14.890 --> 00:16:16.767
- Vincent, it hurts.

00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:17.810
Your stomach?

00:16:17.893 --> 00:16:20.396
You need water. Water, please--
Gemma-- Aah!

00:16:35.577 --> 00:16:38.497
I wish the ground
would just swallow me whole!

00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:40.916
Patrick, I'm really sorry. I'm so sorry.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.252
Gemma, it's fine. Forget it.

00:16:43.335 --> 00:16:44.420
It's fine.

00:16:55.597 --> 00:16:57.224
Hey, are you okay?

00:16:57.307 --> 00:16:59.059
Do you also feel sick?

00:16:59.727 --> 00:17:01.645
I'm fine. I guess I'm just tired.

00:17:01.729 --> 00:17:02.855
But I'm okay.

00:17:37.306 --> 00:17:39.224
Mia, happy--

00:17:42.853 --> 00:17:43.979
Hel- Hello-- Tsk.

00:17:52.696 --> 00:17:54.198
Tsk.

00:17:57.868 --> 00:17:58.952
Vincent.

00:17:59.036 --> 00:18:03.332
Mia, you know I won't stop calling you
until you finally pick up your phone.

00:18:03.415 --> 00:18:05.834
So, might as well be
over with this one, okay?

00:18:05.918 --> 00:18:07.044
Make it fast.

00:18:07.127 --> 00:18:10.923
Happy birthday to my most favorite writer
in the whole world!

00:18:11.006 --> 00:18:12.841
I wish you the best.
That's why I've prepared

00:18:12.925 --> 00:18:14.551
something very special for you tonight!

00:18:14.635 --> 00:18:16.303
- I'll send you the location--

00:18:23.227 --> 00:18:24.353
Hello--

00:18:27.064 --> 00:18:28.857
This happens every year!

00:18:29.441 --> 00:18:31.652
Every! Year!

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:43.182
That's the first time I enjoyed.

00:19:43.265 --> 00:19:45.475
But he said that was just a dream.

00:19:45.559 --> 00:19:47.311
You've been affected by
what happened between the two.

00:19:47.394 --> 00:19:49.396
When will you stop being so obsessed?

00:19:50.731 --> 00:19:53.275
- Happy birthday!
- Thank you.

00:19:53.358 --> 00:19:56.737
We, mothers, love birthdays.

00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:58.113
Mia, I'm worried about you.

00:19:58.197 --> 00:20:00.657
So you won't be affected
by your parents' past anymore.

00:20:00.741 --> 00:20:03.243
- They are monsters!
- Your daughter's not a monster.

00:20:03.327 --> 00:20:06.580
You have to kill her.
Or else, she'll kill you!
