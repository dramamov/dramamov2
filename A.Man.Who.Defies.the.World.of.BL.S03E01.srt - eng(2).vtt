00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.750
I've come to a realization.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:20.890
I...

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.400
live in a certain kind of world.

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:47.910
In other words...

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.250
I'm a resident of a Boys Love world.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.320
But...

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.860
as a background character
who wants absolutely nothing to do with BL...

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.790
I've studied all sorts of reference materials...

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.270
and have successfully dodged every trope thrown my way.

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:07.580
But...

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.080
Kikuchi.

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.140
However!

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:41.940
Hmm.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.500
This is fine.

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.910
I knew it... No matter how much I fight it...

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.330
as someone who lives in this world...

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.630
I can't defy its laws.

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.310
I'm finally...

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.650
going to graduate from being a background character...

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:58.170
and as the protagonist of this world...

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.510
I'm going to fall in love with a guy.

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:03.570
Oh?

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.850
Whoa, whoa, whoa. That escalated way too quickly.

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:19.630
Well then.

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.880
It's almost time to board, so I'm heading out.

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:25.290
Ah...

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.020
Yeah.

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:29.510
Have a safe trip.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.470
Thanks for seeing me off.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.100
Take care.

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:59.050
Kikuchi.

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:10.690
Mmm...

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:12.790
Um, so...

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:14.210
does that mean...

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:15.690
I... I've once again...

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:16.880
managed to avoid a romantic development...

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:18.660
with a guy?

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:28.710
Hahaha.

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:32.990
See? I didn't fall into the trap.

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:34.590
I'm the only one...

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.790
who will never surrender to this world!

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.450
That's more like it.

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:48.130
And so...

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.840
in a world where everything inevitably becomes a BL story...

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.940
as a background character
who absolutely refuses to be in one...

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.980
my arduous daily battle...

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.920
begins for the third time.

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.500
"A Man Who Defies the World of BL 2024"
(Episode 1)

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.370
What's with you, bro?

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:26.000
Suddenly deciding to work out?

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.700
Did hell freeze over or something?

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:29.310
Shut up. Is there a problem?

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:30.490
Ah.

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:32.420
Don't tell me you like someone?

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:35.290
Let me guess, she's into muscular guys?

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:38.180
Bro, you're an open book.

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.030
You little punk, stop it.

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:42.600
Ah.

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:45.160
I guess you don't want this then?

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:48.120
- I bought this just for you, bro.
- Ah! No, I'll eat it.

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.780
- Don't force yourself.
- Hey!

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:52.950
Mmm, this is delicious.

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:02.440
Hey, you've got something on your face.

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:04.330
Huh? What is it?

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:06.080
Right here.

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:09.660
Ah.

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:12.900
This scenario...

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:14.260
For example...

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:16.280
let's say Ayato's boyfriend...

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:19.440
that "Mr. Rose," Tojo, was here...

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:23.880
Hello.

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:25.310
Ayato.

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:26.730
Brother.

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:29.380
The roses behind him...

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:31.600
are in full bloom again today.

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:40.950
Ah.

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:43.050
Excuse me, Brother.

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:45.470
Just as you'd expect from a protagonist in this world.

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:47.710
So elegant.

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:51.370
Always so graceful.

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:53.540
Hey, what do you think you're doing, Tojo?

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:54.780
Huh?

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:57.670
Don't get so chummy with my brother.

00:06:57.790 --> 00:06:59.460
He's not your brother.

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:01.600
Why are you so mad?

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:03.550
I told you to scram!

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:05.450
Don't you touch my brother.

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:06.880
Oh, Ayato.

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:09.810
On the surface, you're just a doting little brother...

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:13.710
but you're actually jealous of Tojo getting close to me.

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:15.040
I told you to leave.

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:16.700
Ayato.

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:28.900
Are you all right?

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:30.870
Mmm.

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:32.390
I'm fine.

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:35.900
Huh?

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:40.740
I smell something sweet.

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.240
It's because I just ate a cupcake.

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:46.770
No... that's not it.

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:48.180
Hmm?

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:51.140
Ayato, you always...

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:52.940
have this alluring...

00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:54.080
sweet scent about you.

00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:56.790
Tojo.

00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:05.310
Ah.

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:08.490
Hmm?

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:09.650
What is it, bro?

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:12.590
No, it's nothing.

00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:24.220
Anyway, good luck with all that.

00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:26.470
So...

00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:28.940
why exactly am I working out?

00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:30.470
The hint...

00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:33.770
lies within that little daydream of mine.

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:35.400
And that is...

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:43.550
So, I'm sure you've all figured it out by now.

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:52.660
VS

00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:55.210
The Arc of Physical Contact.

00:08:57.310 --> 00:08:58.310
Until now...

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:02.160
I've come across all kinds of BL tropes.

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:05.450
So I've decided to go back to basics.

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:08.000
In everyday life...

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.270
there's one thing you need to be especially wary of.

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:11.960
And that is...

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:13.360
Morning, Riki.

00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:14.390
Ah, Shoma.

00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:16.480
- Physical contact.
- What's wrong, Riki?

00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:18.150
Did something happen?

00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:19.510
Huh?

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:21.840
The way your back feels against my hand...

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:23.300
It's different from usual.

00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:28.970
Hey, what's wrong?

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:31.830
The truth is...

00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:34.240
my boyfriend...

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:37.200
No...

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:40.520
my lover broke up with me yesterday.

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:42.600
He said...

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:45.320
he was tired of me.

00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:49.430
I'll never get tired of you.

00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:51.880
Not in a million years.

00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:57.020
Shoma.

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:05.380
Shoma...

00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:07.850
Exactly.

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:11.010
That kind of casual physical contact...

00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:12.950
is the spark that ignites a new romance.

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:17.950
And that's why...

00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:30.570
this is bad. If someone hugs me now...

00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:34.260
it's guaranteed to trigger a romance plot with a guy.

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:36.800
This is bad.

00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:39.500
Getting hugged would be a disaster.

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:47.560
This is bad.

00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:50.600
Bad. This is really, really bad.

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:52.550
Are you okay?

00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:56.730
Bad, bad, this is so bad.

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:18.640
Is this yours?

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:19.960
Uh...

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:21.040
Yeah.

00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:22.910
Thanks.

00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:32.780
And that's how it happens.

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:38.540
A romance with a guy.

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:39.650
Still at it?

00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:41.390
In other words...

00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:43.160
in order to avoid physical contact...

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:46.360
daily core training is an absolute must.

00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:54.090
But...

00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:58.810
there's a type of contact that's impossible to avoid,
no matter how much you train.

00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:00.590
And that is...

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:04.590
Tickling.

00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:08.220
Tickle attack!

00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:09.810
Stop it!

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:15.280
You might think that for guys over 20...

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:17.980
doing something so childish is out of the question.

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:19.500
But tickling...

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:23.070
is a classic move in the world of BL.

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:25.720
You're next.

00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:28.140
So it happens more often than you'd think.

00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:32.220
And going in order, I'm up next.

00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:36.660
To avoid being targeted in this situation,
I have to casually excuse myself.

00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:37.700
I'm just gonna use the restroom.

00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:39.100
Hey, trying to get away?

00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:42.740
No, maybe I'll just play along.

00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:44.090
Yeah, I'll just have to bear it.

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:45.880
Okay.

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:47.800
The key is to play along half-heartedly.

00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:49.510
Hey, don't tickle my sides!

00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:51.190
Because if they think you're trying to escape...

00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:53.370
or if you pretend you're not ticklish...

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:57.050
they'll usually get defensive
and go at you even harder.

00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:58.740
So your sides are your weak spot, huh?

00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:01.790
Then...

00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:04.810
at just the right moment, you give the "it's over" signal.

00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:12.930
By doing this...

00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:15.730
with something like a sigh after laughing...

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.210
you create a "tickle time is over" atmosphere.

00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:22.300
Okay, you're next.

00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:33.910
Huh...

00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:35.210
That guy's voice just now...

00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:36.900
sounded kinda sensual.

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:38.500
And...

00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:41.140
I feel like it's a voice I could really get into.

00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:43.540
Oh, come on.

00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:44.910
Stop messing around.

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:49.320
This guy.

00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:51.950
He's laughing so hard he's crying.

00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:54.440
So cute.

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:55.800
Ah.

00:13:55.890 --> 00:13:57.930
I think I'm a little drunk.

00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:00.780
Want to get some fresh air?

00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:03.250
Ah.

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:04.520
Mm-hmm.

00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:06.570
Sure.

00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:44.150
So remember, everyone, be sure to avoid contact.

00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:58.530
"A Man Who Defies the World of BL 2024"

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:06.880
Oh.

00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:09.040
This pumpkin soup is so good.

00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:10.130
Really?

00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:11.840
It's amazing.

00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:13.140
- Another bowl?
- Yes, please.

00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:14.800
Thanks.

00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:16.100
It really... is delicious.

00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:19.980
Bro, don't slurp your soup.

00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:21.680
What's the big deal?

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:27.730
That's disgusting. You have no manners.

00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:30.470
It's that delicious time of year for pumpkin.

00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:32.070
In other words...

00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:37.480
it's the season for Halloween parties.

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:49.220
To be honest, it's just a regular get-together
using Halloween as an excuse.

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:54.420
This year, too...

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:57.280
at this BL world's Halloween...

00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:00.590
vampires are out in full force.

00:16:00.950 --> 00:16:01.950
Bro.

00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:03.700
That voice is...

00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:14.890
This vampire is on another level.

00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:17.670
All the other vampires pale in comparison.

00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:18.910
And what's more...

00:16:19.930 --> 00:16:22.460
a vampire with a rose on his back.

00:16:23.770 --> 00:16:24.770
It's too perfect.

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:29.120
VS

00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:31.650
The Halloween Chapter.

00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:36.470
Here you go, bro.

00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:37.640
Oh, thanks.

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:39.600
Cheers.

00:16:45.390 --> 00:16:48.140
Lots of people are cosplaying. This is fun.

00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:53.230
Sorry I'm late!

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:54.600
Ta-da!

00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:58.270
The Halloween nurse has arrived!

00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:02.110
Ryota...

00:17:03.050 --> 00:17:04.250
You guys, too?

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:05.960
Like this...

00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:08.840
a guy cross-dresses
for laughs and comes to the party.

00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:11.090
But he ends up wearing the same thing
as a bunch of other people.

00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:12.990
And it just falls flat.

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:15.000
- Who's that guy?
- So cute.

00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:28.660
And...

00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:31.530
the huge difference in quality
compared to the cute-type guys...

00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:34.610
is just mortifying.

00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:39.190
You're right.

00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:41.910
The quality is on another level.

00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:44.530
Who the heck is this guy?

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:46.980
Huh...?

00:17:46.990 --> 00:17:48.190
Bro, you're here?

00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:50.190
Huh?

00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:52.150
Ayato.

00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:53.810
Ah... No, it's not like that. I...

00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:56.610
I didn't have a costume,

00:17:56.980 --> 00:17:58.190
so I borrowed what Mom wore when she was young

00:17:58.220 --> 00:18:00.620
for a talent show.

00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:07.470
Ayato.

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:09.560
Tojo.

00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:14.430
Just as expected from the protagonist of this world.

00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:16.570
A vampire and Little Red Riding Hood.

00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:18.680
A perfect visual pairing.

00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:20.700
It's very...

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:21.700
It really suits you.

00:18:22.890 --> 00:18:23.890
Right back at you.

00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:41.390
I've been Ayato's brother for 17 years...

00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:43.510
and I never realized it at all.

00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:51.330
Damn it.

00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:53.820
I...

00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:55.920
I...

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:57.360
Until now...

00:18:57.750 --> 00:18:59.970
what side of Ayato have I even been seeing?

00:19:03.530 --> 00:19:04.530
Um...

00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:05.850
Are you okay?

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:07.000
Huh?

00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:10.220
This time...

00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:12.550
a doctor appears.

00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:15.640
And a cute female doctor at that.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.520
You look pale.

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:32.880
No.

00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:36.470
I'm definitely not sick.

00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:38.410
This is just the shock of being Ayato's brother

00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:41.060
and failing so miserably at it...

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:42.760
No...

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:44.310
I'm really fine.

00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:46.390
There's no way you're fine.

00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:51.220
Huh...?

00:19:53.050 --> 00:19:54.050
See?

00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:56.070
Your heart is beating really fast.

00:19:57.190 --> 00:19:58.490
Why are there...

00:19:59.110 --> 00:20:01.260
two cute-type guys in the same place
at the same time?

00:20:01.550 --> 00:20:03.280
Because this is a BL world,

00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:04.860
is it just a given?

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:06.480
What should I do?

00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:10.150
How can I avoid this definite BL situation?

00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:11.860
What on earth am I supposed to do?

00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:16.270
I've got it.

00:20:17.010 --> 00:20:19.590
Aah, my eyes!

00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:20.280
Huh?

00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:23.540
The sight of a cross... my eyes...

00:20:24.810 --> 00:20:25.810
Ah...

00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:27.380
Well then, I'll be taking my leave.

00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:29.350
Enjoy your Halloween.

00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:30.240
Farewell.

00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:00.460
This time...

00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:04.490
I shut that down perfectly.

00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:10.320
No.

00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:12.900
These flower glasses...

00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:14.450
are mine.

00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:18.720
No, not you.

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:30.570
The one I like...

00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:32.520
where are they?

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:36.560
Okay.

00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:38.440
Alright, next.

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:40.520
These flower glasses are mine.

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:43.860
Halloween really is an event
where you can't let your guard down.

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:47.010
- Everyone, be careful when you attend these events.
- No.

00:21:47.150 --> 00:21:48.150
Alright, next.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.500
"A Man Who Defies the World of BL 2024"

00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:23.920
(Next Episode)
Let's go out.

00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:25.350
Don't wipe it off!

00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:27.620
(VS The Scent Chapter)
Two people using the same shampoo.

00:23:28.290 --> 00:23:29.890
It smells like him.

00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:32.140
Mixed with your scent,

00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:34.270
it becomes an even better fragrance.

00:23:34.550 --> 00:23:35.710
What should I do?

00:23:36.290 --> 00:23:37.500
(VS The Age Gap Romance Chapter)
Brother.

00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:39.670
An age-gap romance...

00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:42.670
is a classic theme that often appears in fiction.

00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:45.420
Back then, I had no idea...

00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:47.660
of the fateful age-gap romance...

00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:50.520
that was about to befall me.

00:23:50.890 --> 00:23:52.130
That person...
