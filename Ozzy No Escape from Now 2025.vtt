[traffic passing by]

00:22.310 --> 00:24.827
[dogs barking]

00:26.137 --> 00:27.620
[Sharon] Ozzy!

00:27.724 --> 00:30.620
[Ozzy] Are we doing it now
or what? I'm falling over, Boo.

00:30.724 --> 00:32.310
[Sharon stammers]
I just got off a plane.

00:32.448 --> 00:34.103
[Ozzy] You slept.
I haven't slept since...

00:34.206 --> 00:37.758
[Sharon] Well, I didn't sleep.
My eyes were closed.

00:38.620 --> 00:41.241
[Ozzy] You snore when you
pretend to sleep, you know?

00:41.344 --> 00:43.206
[dogs barking]

00:43.275 --> 00:45.172
I've got to make some food.
I'm starving.

00:46.551 --> 00:48.620
We should start off
with things I can eat,

00:48.724 --> 00:50.275
rather than what I can't eat,

00:50.413 --> 00:52.931
which isn't a great deal.

00:53.068 --> 00:56.620
Bland food, no fried food,

00:56.724 --> 00:59.620
no greasy food, no fatty food,

00:59.724 --> 01:02.793
no dairy products,
no ice cream,

01:02.862 --> 01:06.379
no fucking sugar stuff.

01:06.482 --> 01:08.000
- No cakes.
- [barking continues]

01:08.068 --> 01:11.517
[Sharon] It's stuff that
so many people have to do.

01:11.620 --> 01:16.379
[Ozzy] But I don't like it.
Where are the good old days?

01:16.482 --> 01:18.172
[Sharon]
They've fucking gone, mate.

01:18.275 --> 01:21.655
And what did you used to eat
in the good old days?

01:22.275 --> 01:24.689
Booze. And I'm still here!

01:24.793 --> 01:28.000
[Sharon] You can have
lovely fresh vegetables.

01:28.103 --> 01:29.620
[Ozzy] Yes, and...

01:29.689 --> 01:32.689
[Sharon] And you can eat baked
potatoes, boiled potatoes.

01:32.793 --> 01:35.724
- [Ozzy] Yeah.
- You can have any kind of fish.

01:35.827 --> 01:38.689
- [Ozzy] Yeah.
- And you can have chicken.

01:38.793 --> 01:40.620
- Yeah.
- And turkey.

01:40.689 --> 01:43.068
And that's it.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.620
[Sharon] You can have
some pasta. Sure.

01:46.724 --> 01:47.965
And...

01:48.034 --> 01:49.862
[Sharon]
You can have olive oil.

01:49.965 --> 01:51.551
Oh, fucking great,

01:51.655 --> 01:53.344
I'll have a pint of olive oil

01:53.448 --> 01:56.482
and a fucking turkey sandwich
to go, please.

01:56.586 --> 01:58.965
[Sharon laughing]

02:00.620 --> 02:03.034
[dogs barking]

02:06.068 --> 02:07.413
[Sharon] Do you want to go
through this schedule?

02:07.551 --> 02:08.896
[Ozzy] Yeah, all right.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.241
- [Sharon] Do you mind?
- [Ozzy] No, no, sure.

02:10.344 --> 02:12.379
We're not doing too many,

02:12.448 --> 02:14.896
but in between everything
that's going on,

02:15.034 --> 02:18.034
- you're gonna be doing phoners.
- Okay.

02:18.103 --> 02:21.827
For interviews. Like you're
doing Masahito in Japan.

02:21.896 --> 02:23.068
- Yeah, okay.
- [Sharon] All right?

02:23.172 --> 02:25.724
You know, that's
with a translator.

02:25.827 --> 02:28.034
- What? Yeah, yeah.
- With a translator.

02:28.689 --> 02:33.034
And you're gonna be doing a lot
for Germany, Australia.

02:33.137 --> 02:36.241
You're going to be doing
<i>The Observer</i>in England.

02:36.344 --> 02:37.517
You're gonna be doing
<i>Rolling Stone,</i>

02:37.586 --> 02:41.068
then you're gonna be doing
a commercial.

02:41.172 --> 02:43.172
- What?
- A commercial.

02:43.241 --> 02:45.241
- Yeah, okay.
- All right?

02:45.344 --> 02:47.241
And then <i>People</i>magazine

02:47.344 --> 02:49.379
are going to spend
a couple of days with you.

02:49.482 --> 02:51.068
- Okay.
- All right?

02:51.172 --> 02:52.896
- Yep.
- Okay.

02:54.206 --> 02:56.620
- Are you all right about it?
- Yeah, yeah.

02:56.758 --> 03:02.034
Okay. All right, and I wanted
to show you these too. Hold on.

03:02.137 --> 03:03.793
You keep telling me it's...

03:03.896 --> 03:06.517
I can't... You haven't seen it.

03:06.620 --> 03:10.827
You're testy today, Ozzy.
Very testy.

03:10.965 --> 03:13.965
What's up? What's up?

03:14.068 --> 03:16.310
Nothing, Shaz, nothing.
Are we done now?

03:16.448 --> 03:18.310
Do you want to know
about everything

03:18.413 --> 03:20.827
- or is this enough for today?
- That's enough.

03:20.931 --> 03:23.689
Okay. All right then.

03:24.793 --> 03:27.379
He'll wake up one day
and he's really up,

03:27.482 --> 03:29.517
and he's walking great
and everything is fine

03:29.620 --> 03:34.206
and he's up mentally,
and then, boom,

03:34.310 --> 03:38.965
the next day he's like down
and doesn't want to talk,

03:39.068 --> 03:43.000
says he's having trouble
walking and down.

03:43.103 --> 03:48.931
But for me, it's not that
he has trouble walking now.

03:49.034 --> 03:51.517
He's just depressed.
He's so depressed.

03:51.620 --> 03:54.344
Part of it is
like massive depression.

03:54.931 --> 03:56.275
[loud chattering on TV]

03:56.379 --> 03:59.310
He's on-- Can you believe this,
what he's doing now?

03:59.448 --> 04:02.344
[laughing] He does it
on purpose. He knows.

04:02.413 --> 04:04.551
He's just being a prick.

04:04.655 --> 04:07.034
So, I mean, look, he has gone
through hell and back.

04:07.137 --> 04:10.379
He's gone through so much pain
with these operations.

04:10.517 --> 04:13.793
And, you know,
I think to myself, "My God."

04:13.862 --> 04:17.034
When you're still capable
of performing,

04:17.137 --> 04:19.241
and something takes that
away from you

04:19.379 --> 04:22.206
and that excitement of
going on stage and the travel,

04:22.310 --> 04:25.172
and you've had that
year after year after year

04:25.241 --> 04:29.206
and then it's gone,
it's like you wake up.

04:29.310 --> 04:32.034
It's like he woke up
and he was a different guy

04:32.172 --> 04:37.344
because that whole part of
his life's just gone. You know?

04:38.379 --> 04:40.344
[TV narrator]
<i>In this shockingly evil crime,</i>

04:40.448 --> 04:43.206
<i>- the search for the bodies...</i>
- He's-- Look at him.

04:43.310 --> 04:44.482
...discovered buried
in undergrowth

04:44.551 --> 04:46.000
<i>and have been there</i>
<i>for many years.</i>

04:46.103 --> 04:48.689
- [TV volume increases]
- Attributed to the convicted...

04:48.758 --> 04:51.551
- [laughing]
<i>- ...a gruesome mass murder...</i>

04:51.655 --> 04:54.655
Oh, it won't be anything fun
he's listening to.

04:54.724 --> 04:57.448
He will either watch murderers,

04:57.551 --> 05:00.586
okay, World War II or Vietnam.

05:01.379 --> 05:04.551
That's the kind of array.
So that doesn't make you happy.

05:04.655 --> 05:06.068
If you wake up

05:06.172 --> 05:08.620
and you look at the Holocaust
at 8:00 in the morning,

05:08.724 --> 05:10.413
it kind of sets the tone
for the day.

05:10.517 --> 05:13.206
[Jack] Don't forget the
Ronnie James Dio interviews.

05:13.793 --> 05:15.896
The Ronnie James Dio
interviews,

05:15.965 --> 05:19.448
and it's like,
"Why are you watching Ronnie?"

05:19.551 --> 05:21.413
And he goes, "Ah,
I feel sorry for him

05:21.517 --> 05:23.965
and I feel terrible
and I never really..."

05:24.068 --> 05:27.793
'Cause he never really listened
to any of those records at all

05:27.896 --> 05:32.586
and he never-- he never knew
Ronnie, you know.

05:32.689 --> 05:34.103
The first time he met him,

05:34.206 --> 05:36.379
I think, was when he tried
to stab him at the Rainbow.

05:36.482 --> 05:37.724
So that was...

05:37.793 --> 05:39.551
[laughing] With a fork.

05:39.620 --> 05:41.241
It wasn't a knife.
It was a fork.

05:41.310 --> 05:45.931
So he never really knew the guy
and never knew his music

05:46.068 --> 05:48.758
and so he feels really bad.

05:48.827 --> 05:51.275
So, he watches
Ronnie James Dio's interviews,

05:51.379 --> 05:54.137
and I'm like,
"What the fuck are you doing?"

05:55.172 --> 05:57.068
[muttering]

05:57.172 --> 05:59.965
- Is he dreaming?
- [muttering]

06:00.103 --> 06:02.241
Look, he's dreaming. Bless him.

06:02.931 --> 06:06.034
- What's happening?
- Ozzy. Ozzy.

06:08.620 --> 06:10.448
- You're speaking in your sleep.
- What?

06:10.551 --> 06:12.172
- You're...
- Too loud?

06:12.275 --> 06:13.724
No, no, no, it's not too loud.

06:13.862 --> 06:16.827
You're speaking in your sleep.
You're having a chat.

06:17.724 --> 06:18.655
What?

06:18.758 --> 06:20.482
It's okay, darling. It's okay.

06:20.586 --> 06:21.793
- What?
- It's not too loud.

06:21.862 --> 06:22.827
You're fine.

06:22.931 --> 06:25.137
[crowd cheering]

06:25.206 --> 06:29.620
[crowd chanting]
Ozzy! Ozzy! Ozzy!

06:29.724 --> 06:30.965
[Ozzy] <i>Are you ready?</i>

06:31.034 --> 06:34.724
<i>Let me hear the people</i>
<i>in the very back!</i>

06:36.448 --> 06:39.862
<i>Now let me hear the people</i>
<i>at the side!</i>

06:39.965 --> 06:42.724
[production team chattering]

06:46.344 --> 06:48.379
Can I have a cushion
behind my back?

06:49.068 --> 06:50.655
- [tech 1] Okay, there we go.
- [tech 2] Second six.

06:50.758 --> 06:52.172
Yeah, 'cause
I'll sink into this.

06:52.275 --> 06:54.896
[production team chatter
continues]

07:10.448 --> 07:11.965
[tech 2] Ozzy take one.

07:14.068 --> 07:16.517
[production team chattering]

07:28.000 --> 07:30.551
[crowd cheering]

07:43.379 --> 07:47.517
[Sharon] He got
a staph infection in his neck.

07:48.103 --> 07:50.068
And then later on in the tour,

07:50.172 --> 07:52.724
he got one on his thumb.

07:52.793 --> 07:56.931
They put him in hospital.
He was on an antibiotic drip.

07:57.034 --> 08:02.103
And his immune system was so
flawed, we canceled the dates.

08:02.827 --> 08:06.034
And then we were trying
to re-route the tour

08:06.172 --> 08:08.827
to make up those dates
that he missed.

08:08.931 --> 08:12.931
And then on February 2nd,
Ozzy fell.

08:15.068 --> 08:17.931
And that was it.

08:23.310 --> 08:26.068
[Ozzy] I went to the bathroom
and I kind of,

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
I didn't put the light on,
it was pitch black.

08:30.172 --> 08:33.172
I thought, "Oh, the bed's
there," but the bed was there.

08:33.275 --> 08:34.827
I went smack.

08:36.793 --> 08:38.000
I don't know
if you've ever tripped

08:38.103 --> 08:39.862
and your hands hit the floor

08:39.965 --> 08:41.862
and your head hits the floor

08:41.965 --> 08:47.206
and you instinctively know
you've done fucking damage.

08:47.344 --> 08:50.172
[heartbeat thumping]

08:50.275 --> 08:51.965
I heard the thud of his body

08:52.034 --> 08:54.034
and his head
hitting that floor,

08:54.137 --> 08:58.413
and was just like, "Oh, God."

08:59.620 --> 09:02.724
I always stay in the position
and check myself out,

09:02.827 --> 09:04.206
see if there's anything
trickling

09:04.310 --> 09:06.172
down the back
of my neck or anything.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.241
And I lay there and I say,

09:08.344 --> 09:10.068
"Sharon, please call
an ambulance.

09:10.206 --> 09:12.275
I think I've fucked
my neck up."

09:14.310 --> 09:17.206
It was the middle of the night
and I get a phone call saying

09:17.310 --> 09:19.689
that he's been rushed
to the hospital.

09:21.758 --> 09:23.931
It was a bad fall
and they don't know what--

09:24.068 --> 09:26.206
You know, he's hurt his neck.

09:26.275 --> 09:28.689
He was in great distress

09:28.793 --> 09:31.586
and in a lot of-- a lot of pain

09:31.689 --> 09:34.241
and I think
obviously very afraid.

09:34.344 --> 09:35.689
I can't imagine many people

09:35.758 --> 09:38.689
are used to seeing
their parents like that.

09:38.758 --> 09:41.344
I think it was like a Friday
or Saturday night.

09:41.413 --> 09:43.517
It was like a fucking war zone

09:43.586 --> 09:44.965
and people were holding towels

09:45.068 --> 09:47.068
with blood coming out
their heads.

09:47.172 --> 09:48.413
It was pandemonium

09:48.551 --> 09:51.241
and Sharon was fucking
screaming at people.

09:51.344 --> 09:52.862
He was in the midst
of all of that,

09:52.965 --> 09:54.413
which was quite shocking

09:54.517 --> 10:00.068
'cause he's had many accidents
that I've witnessed.

10:01.344 --> 10:03.965
But you could tell
this one was not one

10:04.068 --> 10:07.137
he was necessarily going to get
away with in the same way.

10:07.241 --> 10:10.724
He eventually got seen.
They took an X-ray.

10:10.827 --> 10:12.689
And they said,
"We can see bruising,

10:12.793 --> 10:14.310
but he's fine, go home."

10:15.068 --> 10:17.586
Next day,
he couldn't move his arms.

10:20.344 --> 10:22.344
We went to another hospital.

10:22.931 --> 10:25.793
They did another scan,
like a proper MRI,

10:25.931 --> 10:28.620
and they found that he'd broken
his fucking neck.

10:29.172 --> 10:31.620
And it's just insane to me

10:31.758 --> 10:34.551
that they let him out
of the first hospital anyway.

10:34.655 --> 10:36.413
And that was it.
The surgeon said,

10:36.517 --> 10:39.724
"If he doesn't have this
operation, if he falls again,

10:39.827 --> 10:41.965
he'll be a paraplegic."

10:42.931 --> 10:45.965
He told me that
after I had that fall,

10:46.103 --> 10:51.068
the channel where my spinal
cord goes down had squashed it.

10:51.206 --> 10:53.724
So I thought, "Fuck this."

10:53.793 --> 10:57.137
Had the surgery,
woke up completely fucked.

10:59.068 --> 11:00.241
To be honest, I thought,

11:00.344 --> 11:02.517
"What the fuck
have they done to me?"

11:03.206 --> 11:05.448
'Cause I never thought
the surgeon could do wrong.

11:05.517 --> 11:10.310
Going into surgery,
I was there and he was laughing.

11:10.448 --> 11:12.275
He was in his hospital bed,

11:12.379 --> 11:15.275
supposedly with a broken neck,
dancing.

11:15.379 --> 11:18.275
[Kelly laughing]

11:18.379 --> 11:20.724
[Jack] Let's call
the surgery off. He's healed.

11:21.379 --> 11:24.103
And he comes out
of this surgery

11:24.206 --> 11:29.000
and he's far worse
than when he went in.

11:29.137 --> 11:32.862
I watched my dad go
from being able to sit up...

11:33.827 --> 11:35.586
to I'm like-- I'm sorry
to say this,

11:35.655 --> 11:37.482
but I can't think
of anything else.

11:38.724 --> 11:42.931
Having posture like
fucking Gollum. Like that.

He was in hospital for weeks.

11:45.482 --> 11:48.827
He was in great discomfort
and really grieving

11:48.931 --> 11:50.620
and I think
just in a lot of shock.

11:50.724 --> 11:52.655
Also traumatized,

11:52.758 --> 11:55.655
to fall like that and go
through that

11:55.758 --> 11:59.068
and then not be able to bounce
back like he had in the past

11:59.137 --> 12:00.931
and then having
to cancel the tour.

12:01.000 --> 12:05.448
That was really, I think,
his biggest heartbreak.

12:06.172 --> 12:07.310

So, after three months,

12:07.379 --> 12:08.551
we brought him home.

12:08.689 --> 12:12.482
But the pain
just never subsided.

12:12.551 --> 12:15.000
It was unbearable constantly.

12:15.103 --> 12:17.172
And I know Ozzy's
a drama queen.

12:17.275 --> 12:19.551
He'll do anything
for a pain pill.

12:19.655 --> 12:21.413

in someone's eyes and know.

[Ozzy] It's a pain that
no matter what you do,

12:27.655 --> 12:29.172
it's always there.

12:29.241 --> 12:31.379
When you're
in a certain amount of pain,

12:31.482 --> 12:35.482
it affects your thought pattern
and everything.

12:35.551 --> 12:39.034
You can't enjoy anything.

12:39.137 --> 12:43.206
The screws that they had put
in Ozzy were coming loose

12:43.310 --> 12:46.241
and chipping the bones
against the bones.

12:46.379 --> 12:48.724
So, under Ozzy's spinal cord,

12:48.862 --> 12:51.344
there was damage because
of the bone fragments

12:51.413 --> 12:54.172
that were rubbing up and down
on the spinal cord.

12:54.275 --> 12:59.241
So, it was just like one thing
after another after another.

12:59.344 --> 13:00.896
And while he was in hospital

13:00.965 --> 13:04.758
for three months,
he developed blood clots.

13:04.827 --> 13:08.275
So, then we had the blood clots
to deal with.

13:08.379 --> 13:10.344
He thought his recovery
would be the same

13:10.448 --> 13:12.275

he fell off the quad bike.

13:13.758 --> 13:15.275

13:15.379 --> 13:18.965
But he was 50-what, 55 then?

13:19.103 --> 13:20.620
And he's in his 70s now,

13:20.758 --> 13:24.103
and the body's ability
to recover

13:24.206 --> 13:26.827
drastically changes
in that amount of time.

13:27.448 --> 13:29.655
And he just thought,

13:29.758 --> 13:32.413
"I'll hang out and
I'll be back up and running

13:32.517 --> 13:34.551
and I'll be back on the road
sooner than later."

13:34.620 --> 13:36.241
But the pain never went away.

13:37.206 --> 13:38.655
We're kind of raised
to believe

13:38.793 --> 13:40.586

are superheroes, in a way.

And although they're
very skilled, some of them,

13:45.241 --> 13:48.793
a lot of them really
don't have the answers.

13:48.896 --> 13:52.103
And I think for him at times,
he checked out a bit,

13:52.206 --> 13:53.620
'cause he just felt like,

22:53.827 --> 22:56.206
She got a home invasion
in England.

22:56.310 --> 22:58.827
But this was
a hundred fucking years ago!

22:58.965 --> 23:00.689
But it still
happened in England!

23:00.827 --> 23:03.724
Oh, God, Ozzy, that's
one of a million things,

23:03.827 --> 23:05.862
and millions of things
happen here.

23:05.965 --> 23:07.724
We got robbed in England.

23:07.862 --> 23:09.896
Yes, we did get
robbed in England.

23:10.000 --> 23:11.551
And I caught him.

23:11.655 --> 23:13.034
You let him go.

23:13.862 --> 23:16.275
Well, I was stark bullock naked
at 2:00 in the morning,

23:16.379 --> 23:19.931
what else am I going to do?
Bring him in for a cocktail?

23:20.068 --> 23:21.931
Ah, no, you could have
brought him in,

23:22.034 --> 23:23.793
and we could have
called the police

23:23.896 --> 23:26.034
All of a sudden,
he makes a run for the window,

23:26.137 --> 23:27.655
and I've got him
around the neck,

23:28.448 --> 23:30.137
and he's sort of getting
out of the window,

23:30.241 --> 23:33.586
and I give him a little bit of
friendly help out the window.

23:35.000 --> 23:36.758
He didn't like it much.

23:37.724 --> 23:39.275
We didn't know this,

23:39.379 --> 23:43.448
but previously people
had been into the house

23:43.551 --> 23:46.827
and got in through another
window while we were away,

23:46.965 --> 23:50.758
and they were coming in
just to look at the place.

23:50.862 --> 23:52.655
It is really, really horrible.

23:52.758 --> 23:55.379
And the thing is that
they came into the bedroom

23:55.448 --> 23:56.758
when I was asleep

23:56.862 --> 23:58.758
and took my rings
from beside the bedroom.

23:58.862 --> 24:00.068
[air rifle pops]

24:00.172 --> 24:01.827
And it's weird thinking
that you're asleep

24:01.931 --> 24:04.275
and somebody's right by you.

24:04.344 --> 24:06.068
And you don't wake up.

24:06.689 --> 24:08.103
It's horrible.

24:09.137 --> 24:10.517
Are you nearly done?

24:12.206 --> 24:13.793
- [air rifle pops]
- Ozzy?

24:13.896 --> 24:15.344
- What?
- Are you nearly done?

24:15.448 --> 24:17.379
- Done with what?
- With that target.

24:17.517 --> 24:19.724
[Ozzy] No, I've got
loads of them to do.

24:21.000 --> 24:22.310
[air rifle popping]

24:22.413 --> 24:24.344
[Jack] When he sits
and he's shooting guns,

24:24.448 --> 24:25.965
I think it's a meditation
for him.

24:26.068 --> 24:28.689
He slows himself down.
He controls his breathing.

24:28.827 --> 24:30.448
It's very grounding.

24:30.517 --> 24:32.965
And I think it brings him
a sense of independence

24:33.034 --> 24:34.655
'cause he doesn't
need to rely on anyone.

24:34.758 --> 24:37.482
He has to rely on everyone
for everything right now.

24:40.068 --> 24:43.344
Do they do
a machine gun that's pellets?

24:43.448 --> 24:44.896
[Ozzy] I think so.

24:46.517 --> 24:49.517
Wouldn't it be quicker
to get a machine gun?

24:51.586 --> 24:53.344
But the whole point
of target practice,

24:53.448 --> 24:55.655
it's just something
to relax you.

24:57.103 --> 24:59.172
If you got
a fucking machine gun,

25:02.758 --> 25:07.689
it's like saying, "I play darts
with a fucking machine gun."

25:07.793 --> 25:09.862
No, with a bow and arrow.

25:13.034 --> 25:16.103

25:27.275 --> 25:28.586
[Ozzy] Quiet!

25:34.827 --> 25:36.034
[sighs]

25:36.137 --> 25:39.241
He was delicate,
but every month,

25:39.379 --> 25:42.896
instead of getting stronger,
he got weaker.

25:43.000 --> 25:47.586
So, it was seeing him
come into a room like this,

25:47.724 --> 25:49.586
and then as every month
went by,

25:49.689 --> 25:53.758
he would be like this,
fading, fading, fading.

25:55.586 --> 25:57.931
[Aimee] The surgery
was supposed to stabilize

25:58.068 --> 26:01.448
and it just seemed
to trigger more injuries

26:01.551 --> 26:02.931
below the initial injury.

26:03.034 --> 26:04.482
The pain never stopped.

26:04.586 --> 26:07.655
He went from one surgeon
to another to another

26:07.758 --> 26:10.241
all over the country,
looking for help.

26:10.310 --> 26:12.586
Also, just listening to him
as well,

26:12.655 --> 26:16.172
because, you know,
he knows his body.

26:16.310 --> 26:18.000
He knows how he feels,

26:18.965 --> 26:21.793
and he just kept saying,
"Something's not right."

26:23.137 --> 26:25.413
Watch the dogs
don't get out, please.

26:26.137 --> 26:28.793
We finally found a surgeon
that said,

26:28.896 --> 26:31.689
"They were overly aggressive
with your operation.

26:31.827 --> 26:34.448
They've done stuff that
you didn't need doing."

26:34.517 --> 26:38.103
And what this other surgeon
had done was

26:38.206 --> 26:43.137
he'd put plates either side
with all these screws,

26:43.241 --> 26:46.758
and apparently that
didn't need to be done.

26:46.862 --> 26:50.275
So, he caused even more damage.

26:51.310 --> 26:53.310
They took out the metal plates

26:53.448 --> 26:56.000
and the eight screws
that were in Ozzy

26:57.137 --> 27:00.586
and tried to patch up
as much as he could.

27:02.379 --> 27:04.827
But, you know,
the main damage was done.

27:04.931 --> 27:07.034
I must have had
more fucking surgeries

27:07.137 --> 27:10.206
than I ever dreamed
I would be having in my life.

27:10.344 --> 27:14.482
So, I mean,
you get off your back,

27:14.551 --> 27:16.586
you climb up
that mountain again,

27:16.724 --> 27:19.379
and you get to the top
and you get kicked back down.

27:19.482 --> 27:21.620
So, you get a bit--

27:22.551 --> 27:26.413
You lose a bit of
your self-confidence, you know.

27:30.482 --> 27:32.034
[Aimee]
Having to cancel the tour,

27:32.137 --> 27:36.724
he was devastated, 'cause
I think he wasn't prepared

27:36.827 --> 27:38.000
to know how to deal

27:38.103 --> 27:40.724
with that kind of grief
and disappointment,

27:40.862 --> 27:44.034
and he just started to feel
worse through that period.

27:44.137 --> 27:46.724
So I think, again,
it just was...

27:48.137 --> 27:50.000
soul-destroying for him.

27:50.103 --> 27:54.068
And then at that time,
the depression was so bad.

27:54.172 --> 27:56.551
It just, you know,
it would be like,

27:56.655 --> 27:59.379
'What's the point in even
getting up? I'm not getting up.

27:59.482 --> 28:01.448
I'm not working
with the physiotherapist.

28:01.551 --> 28:03.482
What's the point?"

28:04.724 --> 28:07.620
[Kelly] He wouldn't even draw.
He wouldn't go shoot his gun.

28:07.724 --> 28:10.275
He wouldn't do anything.
He was just miserable.

28:10.379 --> 28:14.241
He was like, "I've got
no escape. I'm stuck in this."

28:15.758 --> 28:17.965
And he's just looking
for a way out.

28:18.103 --> 28:23.000
I said to Sharon, "Look, baby,
I'm sorry I'm a burden to you."

28:23.793 --> 28:26.586
And she's like, "What the fuck
are you talking about?"

28:26.655 --> 28:31.103
But that's what I felt.
I'm not good at being sick.

28:31.241 --> 28:34.965
I hate the fact that I can't
do anything for myself.

28:35.103 --> 28:40.482
Plus, I have not been on
my own for fucking four years.

28:40.586 --> 28:44.724
What I end up doing is sitting
in the toilet reading a book

28:44.827 --> 28:48.103
just to be on my own, just to--

28:48.241 --> 28:51.344
just so that I'm,
you know, head up and all.

28:51.448 --> 28:55.620
It's like you don't get--
We all need

28:55.724 --> 29:00.241
a little bit of space for
ourselves, not to be isolated,

29:00.344 --> 29:02.482
but just to go, "Fucking hell."

29:02.586 --> 29:05.862
But it's like,
you shouldn't lean forward

29:06.000 --> 29:08.103
and people are firing at things
they shouldn't be.

29:08.172 --> 29:11.344
And I wanna go,
"Why don't you all fuck off?"

29:11.448 --> 29:14.482
But you can't do that because
you can't be left on your own.

29:15.344 --> 29:16.896
It's like--

29:17.862 --> 29:20.000
I don't like being
on my own all the time,

29:20.103 --> 29:23.137
but I don't like being with
people all the time, you know?

29:23.241 --> 29:28.344
I think, you know,
the longer he realizes

29:28.448 --> 29:32.793
the one side of his life where
he could run around the stage

29:32.862 --> 29:37.172
and... be independent...

29:38.034 --> 29:40.896
You don't need anybody
to help you get up or down

29:41.000 --> 29:44.275
or pick something up
off the floor.

29:44.344 --> 29:46.103
That's gone.

29:46.172 --> 29:50.000
His life has been
a different city every day.

29:50.103 --> 29:52.827
You know,
20,000 people a night,

29:52.931 --> 29:57.827
constantly bombarded
with loud rock music

29:59.068 --> 30:02.862
and private planes
and all this crazy shit.

30:02.965 --> 30:08.034
And suddenly, he's on the couch
every day, all day, for years.

30:08.172 --> 30:11.517
And it's soul-destroying

30:11.655 --> 30:14.724
watching how soul-destroying
that is for him.

30:18.620 --> 30:21.689
Some days that he wishes
he was dead.

30:21.793 --> 30:25.034
He's in so much pain,
he can't take it.

30:25.137 --> 30:29.206
He just wishes he could go.

30:32.137 --> 30:33.344
So...

30:34.655 --> 30:37.379
[Ozzy] The thought
of not doing any gigs anymore,

30:37.482 --> 30:38.965
I went really into depression.

30:39.068 --> 30:41.655
I'm on antidepressants now,
actually.

30:42.344 --> 30:46.172
I was getting fucking ready
to off myself at some point.

30:46.310 --> 30:51.655
But then I'll go there
in my head and I go,

30:51.758 --> 30:54.448
"What are you fucking
talking about?"

30:54.517 --> 30:56.448
Because knowing me,
I'd half do it.

30:56.517 --> 30:58.551
I'd be half dead and fucking--

30:59.586 --> 31:02.586
I'd fucking set myself on fire.
This would be the fucking--

31:03.620 --> 31:07.068
I mean, I wouldn't die,
you know? That's my luck.

31:08.034 --> 31:13.068
[Jack] The major problem
is the damage,

31:13.206 --> 31:16.241
the nerve damage
from the bad neck surgery.

31:16.344 --> 31:19.620
Yes, the Parkinson's is,
you know, progressing

31:19.758 --> 31:23.206
and, yes, it's showing up
in various ways.

31:23.310 --> 31:26.103
But his lack of mobility

31:26.206 --> 31:29.793
is the huge issue.

31:29.896 --> 31:34.931
That fucking doctor just
stripped him, you know,

31:35.068 --> 31:38.689
of his abilities to move

31:38.758 --> 31:41.413
and it makes me so angry,

31:41.517 --> 31:44.586
because I felt like all this
could have been avoided.

31:45.172 --> 31:47.068

a lot lighter when he was busy,

on something else.

34:56.827 --> 34:58.827
I watched you as--
I could see it like yesterday.

34:58.965 --> 35:00.862
You did one, got the vision,
said, "Give me another track."

35:00.965 --> 35:03.172
You did it.
You answered yourself.

35:03.241 --> 35:04.724
You answered yourself
with a different...

at this point.

36:37.172 --> 36:38.620

36:38.724 --> 36:41.068
that he was kind of leaning

36:41.137 --> 36:42.931
you know,

36:43.034 --> 36:47.068

fucking jobs that they gotta do

- Hello, back.

37:46.000 --> 37:47.965
What I've learned about me is

37:48.034 --> 37:53.137
the fact that I've got about
the attention span of a fly.

37:54.448 --> 37:59.344
I mean, it's like I'm never
in one place. I'm never...

37:59.448 --> 38:02.206
My thought patterns are
this, that, this.

38:02.310 --> 38:04.241
Like if I make a record,
I want to be at the finish

38:04.344 --> 38:05.896
before I start, you know.

38:06.034 --> 38:08.034
That was the beauty about
meeting Andrew,

38:08.137 --> 38:11.758
because it's
kind of like the way I think.

38:12.965 --> 38:15.827
I used to watch
this footage of Sabbath

38:16.551 --> 38:19.413
and it used to be
you were in the middle.

38:19.517 --> 38:21.310
And then I would see
this footage

38:21.413 --> 38:23.275
where you're
on the side of the stage.

38:23.379 --> 38:24.931
How did that happen?

38:25.620 --> 38:28.689
It was kinda like--
It just happened.

38:28.793 --> 38:30.068
But how does that make sense?

38:30.172 --> 38:32.206
"Hey, you, singer,
move to the right," like--

38:32.275 --> 38:33.517
It just happened.

38:33.586 --> 38:37.896
I mean, I was the least
important one in the band.

38:38.034 --> 38:39.793
But you're the voice, so...

38:39.931 --> 38:43.034
Yeah, but they wouldn't listen
to any of my ideas.

38:45.034 --> 38:48.206
'Cause I can't play an
instrument, it's like...

38:49.068 --> 38:50.517
You know, I had ideas,
and then they go,

38:50.586 --> 38:53.862
"Oh, I don't understand what
you're saying, okay."

38:53.965 --> 38:55.379
[Kelly] My dad will never
get over

38:55.448 --> 38:56.931
being fired
from Black Sabbath.

38:57.034 --> 39:00.172
He'll never get over that,
ever, ever, ever, ever.

39:00.241 --> 39:04.275
It hurt him more than anything
people can put into words.

39:04.344 --> 39:07.068
It destroyed him.
Those were his brothers.

39:07.137 --> 39:11.827
Those were his extended family
and all he knew.

39:11.931 --> 39:13.965
[Aimee] You know what?
I don't really know the details

39:14.068 --> 39:16.965
but I would imagine it
in part had something to do

39:17.103 --> 39:18.620
with the substance abuse
at the time.

39:18.724 --> 39:21.620
But I would imagine
it's probably quite layered.

39:21.724 --> 39:24.310
I mean, it was
a traumatic event for him.

39:24.413 --> 39:27.034
His dad died, and then
he gets booted out of a band,

39:27.137 --> 39:31.689
and he thinks, "Well, I haven't
got much to live for now.

39:31.793 --> 39:34.241
Now I have to like piece
this all back together."

39:34.310 --> 39:37.965
And I think it definitely
affected the way he operates.

39:38.068 --> 39:40.275
It's things that,
when you're a kid,

39:40.379 --> 39:42.620
stay with you
all your life, you know?

39:43.137 --> 39:45.758
I've sold as many
fucking records.

39:45.862 --> 39:46.896
More.

39:47.413 --> 39:49.482
When I went on my own,
I had a blast.

39:49.586 --> 39:51.137
I didn't have
to answer to anybody.

39:51.241 --> 39:52.896
But I would just think
similarly

39:52.965 --> 39:54.310
to like the way
you're saying,

39:54.413 --> 39:56.551
like your guys and your band
couldn't see you,

39:56.655 --> 39:58.655
couldn't allow you
to branch out, to go forward.

39:58.793 --> 40:01.137
But to be honest with you,
we were all fucked up.

40:01.241 --> 40:04.172
At the end of the day,
everybody was stoned.

40:04.275 --> 40:06.068
But they all went,
"Oh, Ozzy's stoned."

40:06.137 --> 40:09.482
Because when you do
a lot of acid like I used to,

40:09.620 --> 40:11.586
you've gotta be fucking off
your nut.

40:11.689 --> 40:13.000
[laughing] Yeah.

40:13.103 --> 40:16.275
That's what it does.
It sends you fucking crazy.

40:16.344 --> 40:17.620
I can't take it anymore.

40:17.689 --> 40:19.931
Yeah. Chicken crossed the road.

40:20.034 --> 40:22.758
- Oh, fuck yeah.
- [laughing]

40:22.827 --> 40:24.137
Did you hear that story?

40:25.172 --> 40:26.482
I'm coming up Sunset
one morning,

40:26.586 --> 40:28.275
I'm fucking blasted
out of my head

40:28.379 --> 40:30.344
on some acid or something.

40:30.965 --> 40:33.689
And it was like
6:00 in the morning.

40:34.586 --> 40:35.931
I'm looking out the window

40:36.000 --> 40:38.310
and a fucking chicken
runs across fucking Sunset.

40:38.413 --> 40:41.172
I thought, "Well, I ain't
going to say fuck all,

40:41.275 --> 40:42.655
because they'll all
think I'm nuts,

40:42.758 --> 40:44.931
because
I'm obviously hallucinating."

40:45.000 --> 40:49.586
And then three weeks go by,
and one of the guys go,

40:49.655 --> 40:50.931
"You know what?

40:51.000 --> 40:52.689
When we were going down Sunset
the other week,

40:52.827 --> 40:55.000
I saw a chicken
running across the road,

40:55.103 --> 40:57.482
but I was frightened
to say anything,

40:57.586 --> 41:00.620
because I thought you'd all
think I was fucking nuts."

41:00.724 --> 41:04.655
So, I cracked up laughing
because that's what I saw

41:04.758 --> 41:06.551
and exactly what
I was thinking.

41:06.655 --> 41:09.689
So, they'd all seen it
and nobody mentioned it,

41:09.793 --> 41:11.379
because we all...

41:11.482 --> 41:13.517
It literally escaped
from Barney's Beanery.

41:13.620 --> 41:15.206
Ah, fucking hell.

41:15.310 --> 41:21.206
[Sharon] How could you get
this little kid and Ozzy,

41:21.310 --> 41:24.517
how did they get each other?
I don't know, but they do.

41:24.620 --> 41:29.931
And he makes Ozzy
forget his situation

41:30.034 --> 41:31.896
for, you know, a few hours.

41:32.000 --> 41:33.517
- [screams]
- [laughs]

41:34.896 --> 41:39.206
Andrew is a great salesman.
He's a great cheerleader.

41:39.344 --> 41:43.000
And he has,
be it sometimes annoying,

41:43.068 --> 41:47.965
but he has an energy about him
which is like, "Oh, cool."

41:48.034 --> 41:51.206
Like you're kind of--
You enjoy it.

41:51.310 --> 41:53.724
And I think that
that's fuel for my dad.

41:53.827 --> 41:57.724
We love each other. There's
a genuine love, I think.

41:57.827 --> 42:02.827
You know, a lot of times
as a producer or a musician,

42:03.517 --> 42:06.896
sometimes you work with people
and the work's fantastic,

42:07.000 --> 42:08.586
but it's just the work

42:08.689 --> 42:10.931
and then you move on
and everyone moves on.

42:11.034 --> 42:12.172
And that's okay, right?

42:12.275 --> 42:15.068
That's part of the job
and the process.

42:15.172 --> 42:17.689
Sometimes you make
a friend for life.

42:17.758 --> 42:19.103
And that's what happened here.

42:19.241 --> 42:22.413
We became so close.
We like all the same things.

42:22.517 --> 42:24.103
I don't have that
with every musician

42:24.206 --> 42:25.448
that I work with, you know.

42:25.551 --> 42:27.620
What do you want
to do next, boss?

42:27.724 --> 42:28.896
An album!

42:28.965 --> 42:30.379
What kind of album
do you wanna make next?

42:30.482 --> 42:31.655
A good album!

42:31.793 --> 42:33.862
No shit, you say
the same thing every time.

[dogs barking]

42:41.862 --> 42:43.551
[Sharon]
You know six months ago

42:43.620 --> 42:45.586
when I got the call about
the Commonwealth Games?

42:45.689 --> 42:46.827
What?

42:47.689 --> 42:49.758
Six months ago, I got a call

42:49.862 --> 42:51.448
- from the Commonwealth Games.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

42:51.551 --> 42:53.896
Do you remember? And they said
they wanted you to close.

42:53.965 --> 42:56.586
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Sabbath. Hometown boys.

42:56.689 --> 42:58.896
It's all being held
in Birmingham.

42:58.965 --> 43:01.655
And of course,
we had to say no.

43:01.724 --> 43:03.379
[Kelly] He was really,
really depressed

43:03.482 --> 43:04.862
and told himself
that he couldn't do it.

43:04.965 --> 43:06.896
So, he said,
"No, I'm not doing it."

43:07.034 --> 43:10.344
And then one week
before the Commonwealth Games,

43:10.448 --> 43:14.448
they called and they're like,
"Are you sure he can't do it?"

43:14.517 --> 43:19.000
Apparently, everybody
they've booked for the show,

43:19.137 --> 43:21.379
every other artist has said,

43:21.517 --> 43:23.034
"Is Ozzy gonna be there?

43:23.137 --> 43:26.103
Is Sabbath gonna be there?
Are they gonna play?"

43:26.827 --> 43:29.241
And they've had to say,
of course, "No."

43:29.344 --> 43:31.517
And they just said,

43:31.620 --> 43:33.482
"Could you just think
about it one more time?"

43:33.586 --> 43:36.103
All right, we've thought
about it. We're going, yeah?

43:36.793 --> 43:38.344
It's up to you
whether you can do it.

43:38.448 --> 43:39.965
Oh, I can have a go.

43:40.068 --> 43:41.965
- You're gonna... One song?
- Yep.

43:42.068 --> 43:43.827
- "Paranoid"?
- Yep.

43:44.862 --> 43:46.103
- Deal?
- Yeah!

43:46.172 --> 43:47.655
We leave in two days.

43:47.758 --> 43:48.793
Okay.

43:48.896 --> 43:51.448
Honest? Oh...

43:53.000 --> 43:55.310
[Kelly] It was like we couldn't
get him to do anything.

43:55.413 --> 43:58.689
And all of a sudden,
he says, "Fuck it, I'll go."

43:58.793 --> 44:01.793
And it was literally
less than a week away.

44:03.689 --> 44:06.241
I mean, it was like, "Wow!"

who cares? It's fucking--

I'm there, you know?

he's focused, he's determined,

51:26.413 --> 51:28.620
and then the next,
it's like all gone again.

51:28.689 --> 51:33.551
And that's the way it's been
going. There's no rhythm to it.

51:33.689 --> 51:36.965

I said to him,

right, for Europe?

in what he was doing.

of time where he was great.

"We can't leave it
to the last minute.

to my mom

52:53.827 --> 52:57.000
is the most heartbreaking part
of this whole thing.

52:58.310 --> 53:00.724
And I think...

53:02.103 --> 53:07.448
that watching the man that she
loves most in this world wither

53:07.517 --> 53:10.965
is really, really hard.

[Aimee] They were both so used
to the "go, go, go."

away at such a drastic level,

and terrifying.

has been about

53:25.827 --> 53:29.482
maintaining the control of
all the moving parts of this.

53:29.586 --> 53:32.620
To have all those things
essentially break away

53:32.724 --> 53:36.034

I did a thing with Sabbath.

57:40.586 --> 57:43.448
And I was taking this
medication for my Parkinson's,

57:43.551 --> 57:45.551
which gives you
short-term amnesia.

57:45.655 --> 57:48.620
I got up there and I said
everything fucking twice,

57:48.758 --> 57:51.275
and Geezer thought it was
just highly

57:51.413 --> 57:52.827
the funniest thing
in his life.

57:53.551 --> 57:56.413
But I couldn't stop saying
the same thing, you know.

57:56.517 --> 57:59.137
With Ozzy, it flip-flops.

57:59.241 --> 58:01.586
You know, "I'm not doing it.
I am. I'm not."

58:01.655 --> 58:04.103
And I said, "Well,
if you don't go,

58:04.206 --> 58:06.620
you'll miss out on being

58:06.724 --> 58:12.068
in the group of 2024
that have been inducted.

58:12.137 --> 58:14.758
So, when people go to
the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame

58:14.862 --> 58:17.827
and look in the future at 2024,

58:17.965 --> 58:21.620
you won't be a part of it."
Then he changed his mind.

58:21.724 --> 58:25.206
So, yeah, "I'll go. I'm going.
I'm going. I'm gonna do it."

58:25.586 --> 58:28.241
["Darkside Blues" playing]

58:40.793 --> 58:42.137
Here we go again, Boo.

58:42.241 --> 58:43.655
Yes, my darling.

58:54.137 --> 58:58.103
So, we'll get you ready for
the photo shoot, do that,

58:58.206 --> 59:01.551
and then we'll go in and watch
the guys rehearse for a bit.

59:01.655 --> 59:03.689
- It'll be fun, right?
- Mm-hmm.

59:11.172 --> 59:14.655
[Sharon] To put a band
together is so hard

59:14.724 --> 59:19.379
because Ozzy has worked
with the cream of the crop.

59:19.482 --> 59:20.724
[camera clicking]

59:20.827 --> 59:22.068
[photographer] Give me
a couple of faces, Ozz.

59:23.034 --> 59:26.931
Chin up a little
for a couple. Good.

59:27.862 --> 59:31.068
Great, chin up a little
if you can.

59:33.172 --> 59:36.034
Great, right,
let's bring everyone in.

59:36.172 --> 59:38.000
Let's bring them in,
do a couple at a time.

59:38.103 --> 59:40.413
[assistant]
Let's come on out for now.

59:40.517 --> 59:41.793
[Halfin] Give me the camera!

59:42.655 --> 59:45.517
- Thank you so much for this.
- [chattering]

59:45.620 --> 59:47.000
[Halfin] Just sit on the side
or stand,

59:47.103 --> 59:48.689
whatever you're
comfortable with.

59:48.793 --> 59:50.862
Give me the look, William.

59:52.172 --> 59:55.689
Right then, let's have
two singers and then Maynard.

59:55.793 --> 59:58.000
- Hey, buddy.
- How you doing, all right?

59:58.862 --> 01:00:00.482
[Halfin]
You're not with Tool. Come out!

01:00:00.551 --> 01:00:02.517
- What?
- [Halfin] You was hiding!

01:00:02.620 --> 01:00:04.344
[Sharon] We've got
three different singers.

01:00:04.448 --> 01:00:07.344
We've got Maynard,
we've got Jelly Roll

01:00:07.448 --> 01:00:09.620
and we've got Billy Idol.

01:00:10.137 --> 01:00:11.551
Perfect! Get out!

01:00:11.655 --> 01:00:14.241
- Eat shit, Ross!
- [all laughing, chattering]

01:00:14.379 --> 01:00:18.724
There's drummer Chad Smith,
who's done his last two albums.

01:00:18.827 --> 01:00:23.000
And, of course, Zakk. Couldn't
have done it without Zakk.

01:00:23.068 --> 01:00:27.965
You're fine. Let's have some,
you know, screaming Zakk.

01:00:28.034 --> 01:00:30.068
- That's him! Yes!
- [laughter]

01:00:30.172 --> 01:00:34.620
And we've got
Robert Trujillo on bass.

01:00:34.724 --> 01:00:38.344
Wolfgang Van Halen.
Steve Stevens.

01:00:38.448 --> 01:00:42.724
Then we've got
Adam Wakeman on keyboards.

01:00:42.827 --> 01:00:47.034
And then, of course, Andrew
Watt is going to be there.

01:00:47.172 --> 01:00:49.241
We needed a musical director

01:00:49.379 --> 01:00:53.862
because you can only have
seven minutes to perform.

01:00:53.965 --> 01:00:58.551
And how do you put
a 44-year career

01:00:58.655 --> 01:01:02.034
- into seven minutes?
- [Halfin] Ozz, smile, come on.

01:01:02.482 --> 01:01:06.551
[Watt] They asked me
if I would put it together,

01:01:06.620 --> 01:01:09.931
which meant more to me
than I could ever say to you.

01:01:10.068 --> 01:01:12.413
It's one of the honors
of my life

01:01:12.517 --> 01:01:15.310
to do something that pays

01:01:15.413 --> 01:01:18.413
the appropriate amount
of tribute to him.

01:01:18.482 --> 01:01:19.931
I took it very seriously.

01:01:20.034 --> 01:01:21.413
Right, let's do a group shot.

01:01:21.482 --> 01:01:24.034
Andrew Watt!
Stop being annoying.

01:01:24.103 --> 01:01:26.137
Give him the finger.
Fuck you, Ross!

01:01:26.275 --> 01:01:27.793
[Smith] Fuck you, Ross.

01:01:27.896 --> 01:01:30.413
[Halfin] Now that obviously is
not going to get used anywhere.

01:01:30.482 --> 01:01:32.931
- No one is going to use it.
- I bet it fucking does.

01:01:33.034 --> 01:01:35.413
- It's the best one.
- Who are you to decide that?

01:01:35.517 --> 01:01:37.206
- Best one!
- What do you mean?

01:01:37.275 --> 01:01:39.931
Your favorite saying:
That'll never get used.

01:01:40.034 --> 01:01:43.206
- Remember my asshole?
- [all laugh]

01:01:43.275 --> 01:01:45.620
[Jack] I said to my mom when
she was going through the list,

01:01:45.724 --> 01:01:51.758
I was like, "It's kind of like
the ultimate rock band."

01:01:51.862 --> 01:01:53.448
When you look at it,
you're like,

01:01:53.551 --> 01:01:57.068
"This is like
the greatest cover band ever."

01:01:57.172 --> 01:01:58.551
[Halfin] Sharon, go in for one!

01:01:58.620 --> 01:02:00.068
Yay!

01:02:00.137 --> 01:02:01.448
I'll sit on the floor.

01:02:01.551 --> 01:02:04.482
[chattering]

01:02:04.586 --> 01:02:07.034
[Halfin]
That's good. Yes. Mama!

01:02:07.172 --> 01:02:10.413
[chattering]

01:02:11.379 --> 01:02:13.620
[Halfin]
All right, okay. Smile, Ozzy.

01:02:13.724 --> 01:02:14.965
I am smiling.

01:02:15.034 --> 01:02:17.000
[all laugh]

01:02:18.275 --> 01:02:19.344
[Halfin] Done.

01:02:19.482 --> 01:02:22.931
Thank you. Thank you, guys.
Thank you!

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:26.000
[instruments tuning]

01:02:27.413 --> 01:02:28.965
I wish you were doing it.

01:02:29.034 --> 01:02:31.275
[laughing, chattering]

01:02:33.620 --> 01:02:35.620
[Watt] In picking the songs,

01:02:35.724 --> 01:02:38.241
I chose three of Ozzy's
biggest songs.

01:02:38.379 --> 01:02:41.482
And I thought,
as a solo artist,

01:02:41.551 --> 01:02:45.862
there was kind of like the path
of his career,

01:02:45.965 --> 01:02:49.137
which were "Crazy Train"
with Randy,

01:02:49.206 --> 01:02:52.344
"Mama, I'm Coming Home,"
which is this big ballad,

01:02:52.413 --> 01:02:54.482
and then "No More Tears."

01:02:54.586 --> 01:02:57.827
[warming up]

01:03:00.137 --> 01:03:02.241
Billy Idol's gonna sing
"No More Tears,"

01:03:02.344 --> 01:03:04.517
which I'm really excited about.

01:03:05.586 --> 01:03:10.793
"Mama" has always been
very country music orientated,

01:03:10.931 --> 01:03:14.758
so Jelly Roll is the perfect
guy to do that song.

01:03:14.862 --> 01:03:19.413
<i>♪ All aboard, ha ha ha ha ha ♪</i>

01:03:19.482 --> 01:03:22.758

01:03:23.965 --> 01:03:26.689
[Sharon] And then, of course,
Maynard is a chameleon.

01:03:26.758 --> 01:03:28.758
He can be
so many different things.

01:03:28.862 --> 01:03:31.655
So, Maynard's doing
"Crazy Train."

01:03:33.655 --> 01:03:35.000
<i>♪ Crazy ♪</i>

01:03:35.965 --> 01:03:38.413

watching you sing

01:03:43.793 --> 01:03:47.068
his big single from the first
<i>Blizzard of Ozz</i>album.

01:03:47.172 --> 01:03:48.517
No pressure.

01:03:49.758 --> 01:03:51.758
[scoffs] That was awful.

01:03:51.862 --> 01:03:55.275
It was great to have him there,
but, man, there he is,

01:03:55.379 --> 01:03:59.551
watching me, hearing this.
Oh, boy.

I was a little nervous
doing it,

01:04:11.758 --> 01:04:13.206
but you know,
if you're not nervous,

01:04:13.310 --> 01:04:15.206
it means you don't care.
So you know,

01:04:15.310 --> 01:04:16.655
we cared about
what we were doing.

01:04:16.758 --> 01:04:18.310
I think everybody
was like that a bit.

01:04:18.413 --> 01:04:21.137
The fact that they had
the balls to get up and do it,

01:04:21.206 --> 01:04:22.965
even if they weren't
comfortable with it,

01:04:23.068 --> 01:04:25.482
like they were saying,
"Oh, this isn't my wheelhouse,"

01:04:25.586 --> 01:04:28.413
It's just like, "Yeah,
but that's not the point."

01:04:28.517 --> 01:04:31.344
The point is you're getting up
there and honoring Ozz.

01:04:31.448 --> 01:04:34.310
[Idol] Of course, you wish Ozzy
was going to be up there

01:04:34.379 --> 01:04:38.482
showing everybody what he's
done and what he created,

01:04:38.586 --> 01:04:41.000
the stamp he put on rock music.

01:04:43.862 --> 01:04:45.517
[Ozzy] What do you think
was going through my head?

01:04:45.620 --> 01:04:48.275
I wasn't thinking, "I'm glad
they're doing my gig for me."

01:04:48.344 --> 01:04:50.896
I was going, "What the fuck
is wrong with me?"

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:52.517
And that feeling of:

01:04:52.620 --> 01:04:54.655
I wanted to get up there
and have a go myself.

01:04:54.758 --> 01:04:57.482
That kind of broke my heart,
you know?

01:05:08.896 --> 01:05:11.448
I nearly said,
"Let me have a go."

01:05:12.620 --> 01:05:14.310
But if I'd have got up,

01:05:14.413 --> 01:05:18.620
I know I would be on the
fucking floor in two seconds.

01:05:18.758 --> 01:05:20.586
But my Ozzy little guy
inside was going,

01:05:20.724 --> 01:05:23.034
"Get the fuck up there.
What's the matter with you?"

01:05:23.551 --> 01:05:25.724
It's like
a little demon inside me.

01:05:25.827 --> 01:05:29.137
That fucking guy that's been
there all these years.

01:05:29.689 --> 01:05:31.379
I can't thank you guys enough.

01:05:31.482 --> 01:05:33.551
Of course, I want to be
up there with you.

01:05:33.655 --> 01:05:35.413
[Smith] I know, man.
I was thinking about it.

01:05:35.517 --> 01:05:36.758
I know there's nothing more.

01:05:36.862 --> 01:05:39.000
Listen, all I can say to you,

01:05:39.068 --> 01:05:42.275
you have as much fucking fun
as you can out there.

Because when
this shit comes down, man,

01:05:45.172 --> 01:05:46.482
it breaks your fucking heart.

01:05:47.103 --> 01:05:49.379
To be honest with you,
I spent some time

01:05:49.482 --> 01:05:51.448
in the middle
of the night last night

01:05:52.344 --> 01:05:55.896
looking online for these
fucking bionic legs and things.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:57.413
Then I stopped and I go,

01:05:57.517 --> 01:05:59.379
"But what if you fall over
with them?"

01:05:59.482 --> 01:06:01.448
I mean, I was thinking,

01:06:01.551 --> 01:06:04.172
"That would be great,
the real Iron Man."

01:06:04.275 --> 01:06:07.724
But they're coming out with
really interesting stuff now.

Is that you, Papa?

I love you, Papa!"

01:06:33.482 --> 01:06:35.931
I've always been really,
really close with my dad.

01:06:36.034 --> 01:06:39.758
We have a special little thing.

01:06:40.758 --> 01:06:43.758
Ah. Ah.

- [Kelly] Go to...
- Oh, yeah.

01:06:52.034 --> 01:06:54.620
[Kelly]
I go to my dad for everything.

01:06:55.275 --> 01:06:58.310
Because sometimes my mom
gives terrible advice.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:00.413
He knows stuff about me
that my mom doesn't know,

01:07:00.517 --> 01:07:02.931
but I like to think
that he doesn't tell her.

01:07:03.517 --> 01:07:06.000
But God only knows.

01:07:06.482 --> 01:07:09.034
Here, boy. Come on, Bugs.

01:07:10.482 --> 01:07:14.172
- Not a fucking whisper.

01:07:14.275 --> 01:07:15.586
Come on, Bugs.

01:07:15.689 --> 01:07:17.344
[Aimee] My dad's
quite naughty sometimes,

01:07:17.448 --> 01:07:21.655
because if he's not getting
the answer he wants from Mom,

01:07:21.758 --> 01:07:23.379
he'll, you know, be like,

01:07:23.482 --> 01:07:25.206
"Hey, can you tell her
I don't want to do this?

01:07:25.310 --> 01:07:27.655
And you need to help me
figure this out

01:07:27.724 --> 01:07:28.896
because I can't do this."

01:07:29.034 --> 01:07:30.379
So I'll be like,
"Mom, look, he doesn't--"

01:07:30.482 --> 01:07:32.034
She's like,
"That's not what he told me.

01:07:32.137 --> 01:07:33.724
He told me he does."

01:07:33.862 --> 01:07:36.689
I'm like, "You know what, Dad?
We're not triangulating today."

01:07:36.793 --> 01:07:38.551
So he can be
a bit naughty like that,

01:07:38.655 --> 01:07:42.586
but I think you can't help
but find him very endearing.

01:07:42.689 --> 01:07:44.862
How did you feel
when Sydney was born?

01:07:45.310 --> 01:07:46.551
"Finally, a boy."

01:07:46.655 --> 01:07:47.793
I know.

01:07:48.793 --> 01:07:52.000
He's great, but boys are much
different babies than girls.

01:07:52.103 --> 01:07:54.689
Oh, my God, they're so
different. It's so different!

01:07:54.793 --> 01:07:58.034
But the thing that
I'm afraid of, he's fearless.

01:07:58.137 --> 01:08:00.172
But hey, he's a boy.

01:08:01.206 --> 01:08:03.862
He'll be close to his mom.

01:08:04.586 --> 01:08:07.586
Can't believe in a couple
of weeks you'll be 40!

01:08:07.689 --> 01:08:08.758
I know.

01:08:08.896 --> 01:08:11.000
I'm fucking gobsmacked
about that.

01:08:11.482 --> 01:08:13.000
I can't believe it.

01:08:13.137 --> 01:08:15.793
I can remember just for the
first-- It seems like yesterday

01:08:15.931 --> 01:08:18.896
I was holding you like
you were this big in my arms.

01:08:18.965 --> 01:08:20.965
You had a turned-up nose.

01:08:22.241 --> 01:08:25.793
But you came out going, "Raa!"
And you're still going, "Raa!"

01:08:25.896 --> 01:08:28.103
[laughs]

01:08:28.206 --> 01:08:30.448
I can't help it.
I've got too many feelings.

01:08:30.551 --> 01:08:35.137
My parents had three of us at
one point, three under three,

01:08:35.241 --> 01:08:38.965
with the chaos that goes on in
this family on a daily basis.

01:08:39.068 --> 01:08:41.206
I don't know how they did it.

01:08:41.275 --> 01:08:43.724
Jack was like
one eye closed.

01:08:43.827 --> 01:08:44.931
Aw.

01:08:45.034 --> 01:08:47.724
Aimee was like, you know--

01:08:47.793 --> 01:08:49.931
I was in the pub
when Aimee had come.

01:08:50.034 --> 01:08:53.103
I went to the pub for
a few pints, which was me,

01:08:53.206 --> 01:08:54.620
- all afternoon.
- Yeah.

01:08:54.758 --> 01:08:57.103
I come staggering in
in the afternoon,

01:08:57.241 --> 01:08:59.206
and they say,
"You've got a daughter, sir."

01:08:59.793 --> 01:09:02.379
[Jack] Now I know the struggles
of being a parent.

01:09:02.482 --> 01:09:05.172
I understand why they
did things a certain way.

01:09:05.241 --> 01:09:09.517
I'm also kind of cherry-picking
the things I take from my dad.

01:09:09.620 --> 01:09:12.034
And, you know,
it's certain aspects

01:09:12.137 --> 01:09:13.931
where you're like, "I like
the way my parents did this,

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:15.689
or I didn't like
that they did that."

01:09:15.793 --> 01:09:17.482
That's the kind of cool thing
about becoming a parent.

01:09:17.586 --> 01:09:20.931
I think, ultimately,
there's a sense of gratitude

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:22.724
more than anything,

01:09:22.827 --> 01:09:25.655
just because we got to do--

01:09:25.758 --> 01:09:27.793
I got to do
some amazing things growing up.

01:09:27.862 --> 01:09:30.068
Are you ready for
the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame?

01:09:30.931 --> 01:09:35.206
Well, kind of.
I would have done it myself,

01:09:35.344 --> 01:09:37.310
but I can't stand up that long.

01:09:37.413 --> 01:09:39.000
The fucking thing I...

01:09:39.137 --> 01:09:42.689
What's kinda got up
my shirt a little bit

01:09:42.793 --> 01:09:45.896
is your mom said I'm gonna go
on a fucking throne.

01:09:46.827 --> 01:09:48.482
So, knowing my luck,

01:09:48.586 --> 01:09:50.793
the fucking battery
will go fucking haywire

01:09:50.862 --> 01:09:52.517
and I'll end up
in the front row.

01:09:53.965 --> 01:09:59.034
I keep saying to Ozzy,
"You have to sit for safety."

01:09:59.137 --> 01:10:02.241
He's got all these
blood thinners in him, okay?

01:10:02.344 --> 01:10:05.862
His balance isn't the best
because of the Parkinson's.

01:10:05.965 --> 01:10:11.448
If he falls, because his blood
is like water,

01:10:11.517 --> 01:10:13.448
he could bleed out like that.

01:10:13.517 --> 01:10:16.137
I haven't seen the fans
in fucking six years.

01:10:16.241 --> 01:10:17.655
I know.

01:10:17.724 --> 01:10:20.965
I've been really fucked up
with this body of mine.

01:10:21.068 --> 01:10:24.310
As soon as I want to do
anything, I go to the doctor,

01:10:24.413 --> 01:10:28.000
I've either got a blood clot
or my leg's about to fall off.

01:10:28.137 --> 01:10:29.482
[scoffs]

01:10:29.586 --> 01:10:31.862
But I can't complain.
I had fucking...

01:10:31.965 --> 01:10:36.482
I was actively rocking
until I was 70,

01:10:36.586 --> 01:10:38.655
then a trapdoor opened.

01:10:38.758 --> 01:10:41.241
- Yeah.
- You know that.

01:10:43.379 --> 01:10:46.689
But hey, could have been worse.

01:10:47.482 --> 01:10:48.793
You could be Sting.

01:10:48.896 --> 01:10:51.034
- I could've been Sting.

01:10:56.206 --> 01:10:58.379
[dogs barking]

01:11:03.896 --> 01:11:06.862
You took your injection today
for the blood clots, right?

01:11:06.965 --> 01:11:08.275
Yeah.

01:11:08.379 --> 01:11:10.758
Yeah, I'm just hoping
and praying these shots

01:11:10.862 --> 01:11:13.379
will get rid of
the blood clots by Monday.

01:11:13.482 --> 01:11:14.724
It's like payback time

01:11:14.827 --> 01:11:17.586
because every time
I want to do something,

01:11:17.689 --> 01:11:20.206
I get some bad news
and I can't do it, you know.

01:11:20.310 --> 01:11:25.758
My dad's been having crazy,
like, fainting, dizzy spells.

01:11:25.862 --> 01:11:27.344
He's got something.

01:11:27.413 --> 01:11:30.275
He's developed something called
orthostatic blood pressure,

01:11:30.379 --> 01:11:34.482
where one minute your blood
pressure can be sky high,

01:11:34.586 --> 01:11:36.827
stroke-ville, then
it can plummet down

01:11:36.896 --> 01:11:38.551
to like your heart's
about to stop.

01:11:38.655 --> 01:11:40.068
So, he went to the doctor.

01:11:40.172 --> 01:11:43.482
And in trying to figure out
what this is,

01:11:43.586 --> 01:11:47.379
they discovered he's got a ton
of clots in his legs again.

01:11:47.482 --> 01:11:51.068
Which now means he might not
be able to fly to Cleveland.

01:11:51.206 --> 01:11:53.724
If this was in LA and he didn't
have to get on a plane,

01:11:53.827 --> 01:11:56.724
he would 1,000% be there.

01:11:56.793 --> 01:11:59.758
But because of the blood clots,
I don't fucking know.

01:11:59.896 --> 01:12:03.586
We can't take a risk, and he--

01:12:03.655 --> 01:12:05.896
It's up to the doctors
at this point.

01:12:06.482 --> 01:12:07.931
Listen, we're going to get
you there

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:09.137
whether you have to
crawl there.

01:12:09.241 --> 01:12:11.586
- We're gonna get you there.
- Okay.

01:12:11.655 --> 01:12:12.620
Right?

01:12:13.758 --> 01:12:15.275
That will fuck me up to no end

01:12:15.379 --> 01:12:18.310
- if I can't get on that plane.
- [Sharon] I know.

01:12:18.413 --> 01:12:21.655
The turn of a page,
things changed instantly.

01:12:21.758 --> 01:12:24.448
A doctor gives you
a diagnosis and goes,

01:12:24.517 --> 01:12:27.827
"You've got a blood clot.
You can't travel."

01:12:27.931 --> 01:12:30.482
So now he's on these shots,

01:12:30.586 --> 01:12:33.758
which they hope will get
the blood clots down.

01:12:33.862 --> 01:12:35.965
I hope to see the doctor Monday

01:12:36.068 --> 01:12:38.137
to do another test
on Ozzy's body

01:12:38.275 --> 01:12:40.413
to see if the blood clots
have gone.

01:12:40.482 --> 01:12:45.310
So, talk about leaving it
to the very last minute.

the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame

that Ozzy can't travel?

01:13:31.551 --> 01:13:33.827
How do I deal with Ozzy's
disappointment

01:13:33.931 --> 01:13:35.689
of not being
able to travel?

01:13:35.793 --> 01:13:39.724
And then we're going,
and I'm like, in a few minutes,

01:13:39.862 --> 01:13:42.344

I'm meant to be.

kind of holding that down,

01:19:50.068 --> 01:19:52.482
and then I'm watching Billy,
and he's over there,

and Billy's lips aren't moving,

You know, Ozzy's 44 years.

01:28:23.655 --> 01:28:25.724
[upbeat rock music playing]

01:28:32.275 --> 01:28:35.000
[dogs barking]

01:28:35.103 --> 01:28:37.000
- [Ozzy] Sharon?
- [Sharon] Yeah?

01:28:37.103 --> 01:28:38.034
[Ozzy] Can I ask you something?

01:28:38.137 --> 01:28:39.689
[Sharon] Anything.

01:28:39.793 --> 01:28:41.827
[Ozzy] Did you ever think I'd
make it to the Hall of Fame?

01:28:42.551 --> 01:28:45.827
[Sharon] No, I didn't.
At the dress rehearsal,

01:28:45.931 --> 01:28:49.310
when "Mama" started
to play, you sang along.

01:28:49.379 --> 01:28:53.137
I can't-- That song's so...

01:28:54.241 --> 01:28:57.517
It makes me wanna fucking start
slurping, you know.

01:28:57.620 --> 01:28:59.379
I know, me too.

01:28:59.482 --> 01:29:01.620
I always think of you
when I sing that song.

01:29:01.724 --> 01:29:03.965
Everywhere,
when I was on the road,

01:29:04.068 --> 01:29:07.620
I'd do that one
as the second encore,

01:29:07.724 --> 01:29:10.793
and I always think about you
when I do that song.

01:29:12.034 --> 01:29:13.448
And when he started singing,

01:29:13.551 --> 01:29:15.620
I just welled up
in my fucking throat,

01:29:15.724 --> 01:29:18.068
because I was feeling sorry
for myself at the same time

01:29:18.137 --> 01:29:21.931
that I couldn't get up there
and do the thing myself anyway.

01:29:22.034 --> 01:29:25.068
It was like a bittersweet
thing, the whole thing was.

01:29:25.172 --> 01:29:29.931
I'm lucky that people wanted
to help me out and do it.

01:29:30.862 --> 01:29:33.758
But it was a big part of,
my heart was getting broken

01:29:33.862 --> 01:29:36.758
because I belong up there,
you know?

01:29:38.862 --> 01:29:40.413
[growling softly]

01:29:40.517 --> 01:29:44.310
You did just fine.
Believe me, you did just fine.

01:29:44.448 --> 01:29:46.620
Thank you. We're a team.

01:29:49.034 --> 01:29:52.931
If it wasn't for Sharon
Osbourne, I wouldn't be here.

01:29:53.034 --> 01:29:55.517
I would definitely not have
the success I have.

01:29:55.586 --> 01:29:56.965
I wouldn't be sober.

01:29:57.103 --> 01:30:01.068
I'd be six feet under,
without a shadow of a doubt.

01:30:01.172 --> 01:30:03.275
Because I didn't drink
any less

01:30:03.413 --> 01:30:06.482
or do any more drugs
than any of them,

01:30:06.586 --> 01:30:10.068
but all the guys I used to do
it with, they're all dead.

01:30:11.689 --> 01:30:14.965
So, there must be something
that I did right in the world.

01:30:15.482 --> 01:30:19.206
The one thing I did was
have my Sharon.

01:30:20.103 --> 01:30:24.103
The next thing is the
Birmingham show in Aston Villa.

01:30:24.172 --> 01:30:26.896
Yep. It is.

01:30:27.482 --> 01:30:32.344
Ozzy's one regret about
his music career

01:30:32.448 --> 01:30:36.241
is that he never really
said goodbye to his fans.

01:30:36.310 --> 01:30:38.793
And he felt he let them down.

01:30:38.896 --> 01:30:43.310
So, he wants to do
one last hurrah.

01:30:43.413 --> 01:30:46.310
July 5th.
What?

01:30:46.413 --> 01:30:47.896
- July 5th.
- Yeah.

01:30:47.965 --> 01:30:49.827
- Yeah. Is the date.
- Yeah.

01:30:50.344 --> 01:30:52.517
It had to be done
in Birmingham.

01:30:52.620 --> 01:30:54.620
It wouldn't work anywhere else.

01:30:54.724 --> 01:30:59.103
And so that's why
I decided on Aston Villa,

01:30:59.206 --> 01:31:01.379
because Ozzy was born in Aston.

01:31:01.482 --> 01:31:04.689
He lived around the corner
from the Villa.

01:31:04.827 --> 01:31:08.551
It will be his game,
his last game.

01:31:08.689 --> 01:31:14.103
It's gonna be
a celebration for everyone,

01:31:14.206 --> 01:31:18.551
for everyone, the fans,
all the other bands,

01:31:18.689 --> 01:31:20.379
and especially Ozzy.

01:31:20.482 --> 01:31:23.586
I's a great way
to say thank you.

01:31:25.068 --> 01:31:28.793
["Gods of Rock N Roll" playing]

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:40.172
- [guitars playing]
- [chattering]

01:31:40.241 --> 01:31:44.724
Ivo, the next shot is going
to be Ozzy and me there.

01:31:44.862 --> 01:31:48.724
"Gods of Rock N Roll"
was originally written

01:31:48.862 --> 01:31:50.448
in a hotel room in Argentina.

01:31:50.551 --> 01:31:53.517
I had four chords,
sounded pretty.

01:31:53.620 --> 01:31:55.068
Ozzy was humming a melody.

01:31:55.172 --> 01:31:57.551
And I think
at that point, he went,

01:31:57.655 --> 01:31:59.206
"The gods of rock and roll."

01:31:59.344 --> 01:32:01.379
And I went,
"There's the title."

01:32:01.482 --> 01:32:02.793
[chattering]

01:32:02.931 --> 01:32:06.103
I mean, the booth,
I am beyond happy with.

01:32:10.482 --> 01:32:12.241
Now, Bruno, that can be...

01:32:12.344 --> 01:32:13.931
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We've got loads of time.

01:32:14.034 --> 01:32:15.586
That can be adjusted,
actually.

01:32:15.689 --> 01:32:17.896
Oh, okay. So,
however Ozzy's down from here.

01:32:17.965 --> 01:32:19.482
[laughing, chattering]

01:32:19.586 --> 01:32:22.448
[Morrison] We had squared away
with Sharon and Ozzy

01:32:22.551 --> 01:32:24.758
that we were gonna shoot
this video.

01:32:24.862 --> 01:32:26.517
But obviously, it was
a couple of days

01:32:26.620 --> 01:32:28.758
after the Rock and Roll
Hall of Fame.

01:32:28.862 --> 01:32:31.655
And I did get a text from Ozzy,

01:32:31.793 --> 01:32:35.896
and the text said, "I don't
have a lot in the tank."

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:37.068
Actually, I think it said,

01:32:37.172 --> 01:32:39.275
"There's nothing left
in the tank.

01:32:39.379 --> 01:32:42.000
But I'm gonna come.
Can we make it quick?"

01:32:42.103 --> 01:32:44.793
Do you want anything?
Do you want a cup of tea?

01:32:44.896 --> 01:32:47.931
That'll be a good idea.
No, no just get the thing done.

01:32:48.034 --> 01:32:50.793
[tech] All right, let's get
going, guys. Get it done.

01:32:50.931 --> 01:32:52.068
All right.

01:32:53.448 --> 01:32:54.827
You look good. You all right?

01:32:54.931 --> 01:32:57.620
So we put him
into the vocal booth

01:32:57.758 --> 01:33:01.310
and crossed our fingers.

01:33:01.413 --> 01:33:02.827
[engineer] Ozzy, are you ready?

01:33:02.931 --> 01:33:05.827
- I'm ready to rock.
- Let's roll the playback.

01:33:05.931 --> 01:33:07.344

01:33:07.482 --> 01:33:09.482

[all chattering]

01:33:48.931 --> 01:33:51.482
[Morrison] What is interesting
about that video day,

01:33:51.586 --> 01:33:56.689
and it happens anytime I've
ever done anything with Ozzy,

01:33:57.793 --> 01:34:03.379
music in its purest form
gives the guy energy.

01:34:03.482 --> 01:34:04.965
I enjoyed singing that.

01:34:05.068 --> 01:34:07.620
[Morrison] It looked amazing.
It really did.

01:34:07.724 --> 01:34:11.724
We're good. Ozzy's going
to be out within the hour.

01:34:11.862 --> 01:34:14.103
Oh, don't worry about it.

01:34:14.241 --> 01:34:16.241
What goofing around?
We can't goof around

01:34:16.344 --> 01:34:18.241
like you really used
to goof around,

01:34:18.344 --> 01:34:19.724
because we'll get arrested.

01:34:19.827 --> 01:34:23.000
By the time we finished
the first set of takes,

01:34:23.068 --> 01:34:26.413
which was close-ups on him in
the vocal booth,

01:34:26.517 --> 01:34:29.034
he came out
and he was energized.

01:34:29.137 --> 01:34:30.896
It was a different Ozzy.

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:34.586
And that happens when
you're recording with him.

01:34:34.689 --> 01:34:37.068
I've seen it happen
with Sabbath

01:34:37.172 --> 01:34:39.413
when they were touring and
I was hanging out with them.

01:34:39.551 --> 01:34:41.068
I've seen it happen a lot.

01:34:41.206 --> 01:34:46.310

his soul.

[Sharon] Thank you.

01:35:27.206 --> 01:35:28.931
[Mike] Did you need any of
the other stuff today?

01:35:29.034 --> 01:35:30.413
[Sharon] Uh, no.

01:35:30.517 --> 01:35:31.551
[Mike] Okay.

01:35:31.620 --> 01:35:32.758
[Sharon] Thank you.

01:35:33.586 --> 01:35:36.344
- Do you want to sit in, Mike?
- [Mike] I'm gonna sit in.

01:35:36.448 --> 01:35:39.172
All righty then, hello, baby.

01:35:39.275 --> 01:35:41.965
Hello, hello, hello.
Come on, come on.

- <i>Hey, Shazzy.</i>
- [Sharon] Good morning.

01:35:45.103 --> 01:35:46.275
- Hey, Sharon.
- Hi, Andy.

01:35:46.379 --> 01:35:48.068
How are you, my darling?

01:35:48.137 --> 01:35:50.137
All good, thank you, all good.

01:35:50.241 --> 01:35:52.172
Hey, Tom.
Good to see you, mate.

01:35:52.275 --> 01:35:56.137
[Sharon] To decide who does
play at the Aston Villa show,

01:35:56.241 --> 01:36:00.068
it's people that have worked
with Ozzy over the years

01:36:00.137 --> 01:36:02.827
and they share the love
of the music together.

01:36:02.896 --> 01:36:07.862
We've got Metallica.
We've got Slayer, Pantera,

01:36:07.965 --> 01:36:11.724
of course Zakk, Zakk Wylde.

01:36:11.827 --> 01:36:15.241
We've got Sammy Hagar.
We've got Yungblud.

01:36:15.379 --> 01:36:19.310
I mean,
it just goes on and on and on.

01:36:19.379 --> 01:36:22.862
Okay, what have we got?
You gonna start, Andy?

01:36:22.965 --> 01:36:26.965
Alice in Chains, Metallica,

01:36:27.551 --> 01:36:32.068
Slayer are all
effectively locked in.

01:36:32.172 --> 01:36:35.724
[Sharon] Ozzy texted
all the guys in Sabbath

01:36:35.862 --> 01:36:40.034
and said he wants
to say goodbye to his fans

01:36:40.137 --> 01:36:44.482
and he would love them
to be there where it began.

01:36:44.586 --> 01:36:47.965
And they all said yes.

01:36:48.034 --> 01:36:49.379
With Slash and Duff,

01:36:49.482 --> 01:36:53.068
they have a show the day
before in Stockholm,

01:36:53.172 --> 01:36:58.000
they then will fly to us,
do the show, and then fly out.

01:36:58.103 --> 01:37:00.551
So everybody's said yes.

01:37:00.689 --> 01:37:04.448
It's just now we just gotta
pin them down.

01:37:04.551 --> 01:37:07.068
<i>If there's any help</i>
<i>that I can be</i>

01:37:07.137 --> 01:37:09.068

<i>artist-to-artist perspective,</i>

01:37:09.137 --> 01:37:12.137
<i>let me know and I'm happy</i>

01:37:12.241 --> 01:37:15.724

<i>So just let me know if I can</i>
<i>be of help in that regard.</i>

01:37:21.448 --> 01:37:22.862
Thank you. Thank you.

01:37:23.551 --> 01:37:28.620
Tom Morello was my first choice
for a musical director.

01:37:28.724 --> 01:37:32.793
He has the respect of
so many different musicians,

01:37:32.931 --> 01:37:35.896
and he's going to work out
who works with who

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.103
and what songs
they're gonna do.

01:37:38.206 --> 01:37:40.103
The first call I made
was to Metallica.

01:37:40.206 --> 01:37:42.586
And I thought, like,
if you could anchor this thing

01:37:42.655 --> 01:37:44.586
with Black Sabbath,
Ozzy and Metallica,

01:37:44.689 --> 01:37:46.310
and they were very eager
to do it,

01:37:46.413 --> 01:37:48.724
and once Metallica was locked,

01:37:48.793 --> 01:37:49.931
you start calling people.

01:37:50.068 --> 01:37:51.724
People pick up
the fucking phone, dude.

01:37:51.793 --> 01:37:54.103
When you're like,
"There's one more Sabbath show,

01:37:54.241 --> 01:37:56.551
all four original members,
Ozzy's last show.

01:37:56.620 --> 01:37:58.034
Metallica's playing as well,"

01:37:58.103 --> 01:38:00.620
you can hear
their jaws unhinging

01:38:00.724 --> 01:38:03.000
and dropping to the floor
when they hear that

01:38:03.068 --> 01:38:05.137
and then just-- then it was
a matter of scheduling.

01:38:05.241 --> 01:38:09.310
Do we then look
at announcing this show

01:38:11.344 --> 01:38:13.275
<i>that first week of February?</i>

01:38:13.379 --> 01:38:15.379
Yeah, yeah.

01:38:15.482 --> 01:38:18.724
Would you and Tony Iommi
be around live

01:38:18.862 --> 01:38:23.482
<i>if we did a press conference</i>
<i>at Villa Park?</i>

01:38:23.586 --> 01:38:26.689
Ozzy's mind is overwhelmed

01:38:26.793 --> 01:38:32.137
with the way people are showing
up for him, and also fear.

01:38:35.310 --> 01:38:37.034
He is very afraid,

01:38:37.137 --> 01:38:41.862
but I know that with
the emotion behind it all,

01:38:41.965 --> 01:38:46.310
it will carry him through
the day. He's gonna be fine.

Here we go! Here we go!

01:39:21.517 --> 01:39:23.724
I don't think that Ozzy
realizes

01:39:23.827 --> 01:39:26.586
that it's
as big as it is.

01:39:26.689 --> 01:39:29.379
When you see the reaction
when you come in

01:39:29.482 --> 01:39:31.379
and you talk
to people in the press

01:39:31.448 --> 01:39:36.206
and you see the reaction
of how big it actually is,

01:39:36.310 --> 01:39:38.827
I'm quite overwhelmed.

01:39:39.620 --> 01:39:42.448
Like when we went
into the locker rooms

01:39:42.586 --> 01:39:47.000
and you saw all the T-shirts
with all the bands' names on,

01:39:47.068 --> 01:39:48.379
it is overwhelming.

01:39:48.482 --> 01:39:51.448
You're like, "No, wow."

01:39:51.551 --> 01:39:54.896
It's unbelievable.
It gives you the goosebumps.

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:59.034
It's Ozzy's, um,
definite, definite farewell.

01:39:59.137 --> 01:40:01.413
There's gotta be a time
where you've got to stop.

01:40:01.517 --> 01:40:02.862
- Yeah.
- You can't just go on.

01:40:02.931 --> 01:40:04.655
And you stop with dignity.

started, which is all together.

[somber music playing]

01:40:46.655 --> 01:40:51.965
I suppose I've come to
the realization that Ozzy,

01:40:53.275 --> 01:40:56.551
I don't think at this point
where we are today...

01:40:56.655 --> 01:41:00.620
The way I feel now, it'll be
a miracle if I make it.

01:41:01.586 --> 01:41:05.103
But I've said this before
and pulled it off.

01:41:05.206 --> 01:41:06.448
I don't know.

01:41:06.517 --> 01:41:09.137
My back is really
in a bad state,

01:41:09.241 --> 01:41:11.448
but I'm in a lot of pain.

01:41:14.827 --> 01:41:16.655
I'm just keeping
my fingers crossed.

01:41:16.793 --> 01:41:20.241
Each time, we see you

01:41:20.310 --> 01:41:25.862
and we do our catch up
on Ozzy's life, it's...

01:41:27.793 --> 01:41:30.931
it's just got
a little bit worse.

01:41:33.310 --> 01:41:37.482
So, we're in April.

01:41:38.862 --> 01:41:42.103
Ozzy has been sick
with a new issue.

01:41:42.172 --> 01:41:45.551
He had a cracked vertebrae
on his back

01:41:45.655 --> 01:41:48.620
which was
excruciatingly painful.

01:41:48.724 --> 01:41:53.172
They told us if it's gonna
heal, it can take six weeks.

01:41:53.275 --> 01:41:54.758
Don't do anything,

01:41:54.862 --> 01:41:58.275
leave it six weeks.
We left it six weeks.

01:41:58.379 --> 01:42:01.965
His vertebrae did not
fix itself. It got worse.

01:42:02.724 --> 01:42:05.344
So then they suggested
that Ozzy goes in

01:42:05.448 --> 01:42:07.689
and they do a procedure,

01:42:07.793 --> 01:42:09.551
where they fill--

01:42:10.310 --> 01:42:12.724
They call it human concrete.

01:42:12.862 --> 01:42:17.206
It's this solution that fills
the broken vertebrae.

01:42:17.310 --> 01:42:20.689
Ozzy was fine for two weeks
after that,

01:42:21.310 --> 01:42:25.172
then he was in agony again
with his back

01:42:25.275 --> 01:42:28.068
and he went back into hospital,

01:42:28.206 --> 01:42:30.172
back out of hospital.

01:42:30.689 --> 01:42:33.068
He came back out
with pneumonia.

01:42:36.275 --> 01:42:42.000
So Ozzy was in hospital
three times and then...

01:42:44.482 --> 01:42:48.068
I mean, I'm lost.
Then the pain was so bad,

01:42:48.172 --> 01:42:49.482
he went back again.

01:42:49.551 --> 01:42:51.551
And they discovered that Ozzy,

01:42:51.655 --> 01:42:54.655
while he was in hospital,
had caught sepsis.

01:42:56.965 --> 01:43:00.379
So here we are,

01:43:00.482 --> 01:43:02.137
we're nearly the end of April

01:43:02.275 --> 01:43:05.724
and they're now telling us
that Ozzy's vertebrae

01:43:05.793 --> 01:43:09.413
beneath the one that's fixed
is cracked.

01:43:10.551 --> 01:43:14.655
He can't be operated on
because it was so excruciating.

01:43:15.620 --> 01:43:19.000
And here we are today.
What do we do?

01:43:20.689 --> 01:43:24.758
Well, I think the problem now
is getting to England,

01:43:24.862 --> 01:43:30.068
but it's just fucking
soul-destroying, you know?

01:43:30.137 --> 01:43:35.413
But I've gotta be there.
I have to be there.

There's no two ways about it.
I have to be there.

It's just-- As I'm getting on
with it, and going further

it's getting slowly worse.

It's fucking crippling me.

01:44:02.172 --> 01:44:06.172
I can't walk very far.
I can't bend down. I can't--

in a fucking chair...

01:44:10.793 --> 01:44:14.344
All I can do is turn up
and do the best I can.

01:44:14.448 --> 01:44:15.965
That's all I can do,

01:44:16.068 --> 01:44:17.931
rather than
sitting here moping.

01:44:18.034 --> 01:44:22.379
If I'm sitting here
and I ain't there,

01:44:22.482 --> 01:44:24.896
I'm gonna be doubly pissed off.

01:44:26.551 --> 01:44:31.310
It's just these fucking
medical things, you know?

01:44:33.724 --> 01:44:35.241
I'll be there.

01:44:36.551 --> 01:44:38.068
I'll definitely be there.

01:44:42.620 --> 01:44:44.034
But I'll be there.

I want to
maintain 70 RPM, Ozzy.

01:45:07.620 --> 01:45:09.103

So that when the back pain
subsides, we can keep walking.

with the left.

living with me at the moment

who puts these electric things
on me which zaps my muscles

01:45:33.379 --> 01:45:35.206
and gets them going again.

01:45:35.758 --> 01:45:37.620
It's a slow process.

lay down yet. Just rest.

I go from nought
to fucking 300 in a day.

01:45:53.448 --> 01:45:55.793
I wonder why I can't walk
for the next day, you know.

01:45:55.896 --> 01:45:59.137
Don't expect me to do
too much in here today.

01:45:59.241 --> 01:46:00.275
Don't what?

01:46:00.413 --> 01:46:02.310
Don't expect me
to do too much.

01:46:02.379 --> 01:46:04.793
I know I'm not. You tell me.

01:46:04.896 --> 01:46:07.137
- My back.
- Your back, yeah.

01:46:07.206 --> 01:46:08.586
It's fucking killing me.

01:46:08.655 --> 01:46:10.482
Your back hurts, yeah.

01:46:12.206 --> 01:46:14.275
- Any dizziness?
- No.

01:46:14.344 --> 01:46:16.172
Good. So you got his legs?

01:46:16.310 --> 01:46:17.896
- Yeah.
- All right.

01:46:18.034 --> 01:46:21.206
[Aimee] He essentially has to
relearn how his body moves.

01:46:21.310 --> 01:46:23.551
When to push it, when to not.

01:46:24.068 --> 01:46:26.655
Everything pretty much
breaks down pretty quickly

01:46:26.758 --> 01:46:28.068
the more inactive you are,

01:46:28.172 --> 01:46:30.724
so it's challenging
and it's uncomfortable.

01:46:30.862 --> 01:46:32.655
And he's been uncomfortable
for so long,

01:46:32.758 --> 01:46:34.310
he doesn't want
to feel any more of that.

01:46:34.379 --> 01:46:36.517
But it's just about,
kind of, mentally coaching him

01:46:36.620 --> 01:46:37.965
through those moments.

01:46:38.068 --> 01:46:39.620

All right, slow and controlled.

01:46:39.724 --> 01:46:41.827

Slow and controlled, good job.

Ten reps and then rest.

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.172

the objectives is to get him

functionally capable
for the concert,

01:46:52.931 --> 01:46:57.344
but more importantly to me is
to enhance his overall health

01:46:57.448 --> 01:46:58.862
for the rest of his life.

All right, rest. How was that?

01:47:07.103 --> 01:47:10.034
- [groans]
- You can tolerate it?

01:47:10.103 --> 01:47:11.931
- Yeah.
- All right.

01:47:12.034 --> 01:47:14.275
[Aimee] Gary couldn't care less
who he is or who he's not

01:47:14.413 --> 01:47:15.724
and just sees a person

01:47:15.827 --> 01:47:19.000
that has the ability
to overcome this

01:47:19.103 --> 01:47:21.241
and knows exactly how to
get him through those moments

01:47:21.379 --> 01:47:24.758
where he's about ready
to throw the towel in.

01:47:24.862 --> 01:47:26.551
With one leg now?

01:47:27.448 --> 01:47:30.103
If you can. If not,
we'll stay with two.

01:47:30.206 --> 01:47:31.965
Okay, press.

01:47:33.310 --> 01:47:37.206
Good job.
That's good strength, Ozzy.

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.896
Nice. Good effort.

01:47:41.793 --> 01:47:44.862
When I think about
all the things

01:47:44.965 --> 01:47:46.724
that have
broken down in his body,

01:47:46.827 --> 01:47:51.379
and I think, "My God,
you are fucking Iron Man."

01:47:51.482 --> 01:47:52.965
Not only physical,

01:47:53.068 --> 01:47:56.724
with all the bits of metal,
pins, rods that's in his body,

01:47:56.827 --> 01:47:58.655
but mentally too.

01:47:59.758 --> 01:48:03.482
So, here's my question.
Let's rest here a minute.

01:48:04.827 --> 01:48:08.241
My question is,
your legs are warmed up.

01:48:08.310 --> 01:48:12.137
You showed some good strength.
Can you walk to the house?

01:48:13.103 --> 01:48:14.689
I could have walked here.

01:48:14.793 --> 01:48:18.034
Okay, then let's
walk a little bit.

01:48:18.827 --> 01:48:21.965
[Ozzy] All I can say is,
I'm working my balls off

01:48:22.068 --> 01:48:24.517
to get myself ready
for the Villa.

01:48:24.620 --> 01:48:27.724
I want to feel confident enough
to pull it off.

01:48:27.827 --> 01:48:32.000
Because it's gotta be the
fucking best show in the world.

01:48:34.448 --> 01:48:37.689
It's gotta be just the best
show in the world when I do it.

01:48:38.655 --> 01:48:41.206
Otherwise,
what's the point in doing it?

01:49:12.482 --> 01:49:13.896
Are you happy to be here?

01:49:14.034 --> 01:49:16.000
To be honest with you, I never
thought I was gonna make it.

01:49:16.068 --> 01:49:17.793
Do you remember
when we were in LA

01:49:17.862 --> 01:49:19.379
and you went on
the elliptical

01:49:19.482 --> 01:49:21.517
and you went on
for two and a half minutes?

01:49:21.620 --> 01:49:23.206
Yeah.

01:49:23.310 --> 01:49:25.689
Well, now you just did ten
minutes on the walking machine.

01:49:25.758 --> 01:49:28.655
Yeah, but that's fucking
killing my legs now.

01:49:28.724 --> 01:49:31.862
The trainer's driving me nuts
in the fucking gym.

01:49:31.931 --> 01:49:35.241
And I've told him I don't want
to do anything serious

01:49:35.344 --> 01:49:37.206
till after the show.

01:49:37.344 --> 01:49:39.517
My legs feel
like I've been fucking...

01:49:39.586 --> 01:49:41.896
Beaten? Do you feel
like you've been beaten?

01:49:42.034 --> 01:49:44.793
These muscles here are
really sore. And my ankles.

01:49:44.862 --> 01:49:47.827
Do you feel that you've come--

01:49:47.931 --> 01:49:51.034
I don't feel that
I've come very far.

01:49:51.137 --> 01:49:57.137
But then, do you feel that I've
changed or gotten any better?

01:49:58.724 --> 01:50:02.655
I think that getting you
moving around,

01:50:02.724 --> 01:50:05.310
changing environment...

01:50:05.379 --> 01:50:07.000
No, no, no, no.

01:50:07.103 --> 01:50:09.275
No, hold on. Hold on.

01:50:09.379 --> 01:50:11.413
Not that. Just in my person.

01:50:11.551 --> 01:50:13.965
Not fucking going to the shops
or anything.

01:50:14.034 --> 01:50:16.172
No, I'm just saying,

01:50:16.241 --> 01:50:19.379
just seeing you
in a different environment

01:50:19.517 --> 01:50:22.241
and the way you're getting
around the house

01:50:22.344 --> 01:50:24.482
and going to the studio
and coming back,

01:50:24.586 --> 01:50:27.344
it's really good

01:50:27.448 --> 01:50:28.551
to see you busy.

01:50:28.689 --> 01:50:31.103
But that wasn't
the question.

01:50:31.206 --> 01:50:33.896
It is because I'm answering.

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:40.000
Because before in LA,
you would go literally

01:50:40.103 --> 01:50:42.965
from the bedroom down
to the kitchen.

01:50:43.620 --> 01:50:45.034
What do I do now?

01:50:45.689 --> 01:50:47.896
You are all
over the bloody place.

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.586
- No, no, no.
- Yes, you are.

01:50:50.689 --> 01:50:53.482
The question was not
where I've been

01:50:53.551 --> 01:50:55.517
or where I come
downstairs or whatever.

01:50:55.586 --> 01:50:58.413
The question was,
do you think...

01:50:58.551 --> 01:51:02.068
do you see
any physical change in me?

01:51:02.137 --> 01:51:04.137
Yes. You're more active.

01:51:04.241 --> 01:51:05.896
That's not the answer I want.

01:51:05.965 --> 01:51:10.586
Okay, are you the same as
you were three years ago? No.

01:51:10.655 --> 01:51:13.586
Am I the same as
I was three months ago?

01:51:13.689 --> 01:51:17.551
- Absolutely not.
- For the better?

01:51:17.620 --> 01:51:22.000
For the better,
and again you're more active.

01:51:22.551 --> 01:51:23.931
Okay.

01:51:24.724 --> 01:51:29.965
When we last spoke,
Ozzy still had sepsis.

01:51:30.068 --> 01:51:33.724
He'd been treated for it
for two and a half months,

01:51:33.793 --> 01:51:38.586
and a lot of people
don't survive sepsis.

01:51:38.689 --> 01:51:44.448
But anyone of 76
that survives sepsis,

01:51:44.586 --> 01:51:47.620
as well as everything else
he's gone through,

01:51:47.724 --> 01:51:49.758
and then to end up with that,

01:51:49.862 --> 01:51:55.413
but Ozzy, thank God,
survived and he's been okay.

01:51:55.517 --> 01:51:59.896
LA's one thing, but the English
summer is fantastic.

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.827
It's kind of like
a new thing for us both.

01:52:02.931 --> 01:52:05.379
I'm looking forward
to getting this gig over,

01:52:06.241 --> 01:52:09.172

some time with you.

Take a bow, come home.

I just want to live a life.
That's all I wanna do.

01:52:27.655 --> 01:52:29.689
Find a little bubble somewhere

01:52:29.793 --> 01:52:32.379
and just live out
our life together,

01:52:32.896 --> 01:52:36.724

01:52:37.482 --> 01:52:38.758
It's time.

01:52:40.310 --> 01:52:44.689
I didn't think
I was gonna live past 40.

01:52:46.482 --> 01:52:48.551
I shouldn't have lived past 40.

01:52:49.827 --> 01:52:51.034
But I did.

01:52:52.172 --> 01:52:55.793
And if my life's coming
to an end,

01:52:56.931 --> 01:53:00.344
I really can't complain.
I've had a great life.

This is Ozzy's final gig.
This is the end of what you do.

I don't know how--

01:54:38.241 --> 01:54:40.896
I don't know how
to do that yet.

01:54:41.655 --> 01:54:44.896
It's got to be difficult
when your mind

01:54:45.931 --> 01:54:48.517
wants to do what
you've always done,

01:54:48.620 --> 01:54:50.758
because there's no doubt
the spirit of heavy metal

01:54:50.862 --> 01:54:53.137
lives in Ozzy Osbourne.

01:54:53.241 --> 01:54:58.034
But your body is telling you,
"Fuck you, I am just so done."

01:55:27.034 --> 01:55:29.689
the people that are here
do really support Ozzy.

01:55:29.827 --> 01:55:31.206
It's such a humbling thing

01:55:31.344 --> 01:55:33.724
that the woman who stood
by his side

01:55:33.862 --> 01:55:35.379
in every trial and tribulation,

01:55:35.517 --> 01:55:38.758
she wants to throw him

and it's so humbling to me,

"Who would do that for me?"

01:55:45.172 --> 01:55:47.034
