WEBVTT

00:00:00.041 --> 00:00:02.919
Everyone thought you were dead!

00:00:03.002 --> 00:00:05.672
I'm the only one
who saw you rise from the lake!

00:00:05.755 --> 00:00:07.966
I'm not Ingrid!

00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:10.385
I'm her fan! Just her fan!

00:00:10.468 --> 00:00:14.139
You probably
thought I forgot, didn't you?

00:00:14.222 --> 00:00:16.975
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

00:00:18.101 --> 00:00:19.477
Happy birthday

00:00:19.561 --> 00:00:21.479
Best birthday gift ever.

00:00:21.563 --> 00:00:22.689
I missed you.

00:00:22.772 --> 00:00:23.940
You're all red.

00:00:24.023 --> 00:00:24.899
Do I feel hot?

00:00:24.983 --> 00:00:26.443
I know you're hot.

00:00:26.526 --> 00:00:28.111
You're really sick.

00:00:28.194 --> 00:00:29.779
This is what I need.

00:00:29.863 --> 00:00:31.531
Didn't I teach you how to share?

00:00:31.614 --> 00:00:37.120
No. If I give you some,
you might take everything.

00:01:43.311 --> 00:01:44.479
Patrick?

00:01:49.484 --> 00:01:50.735
Patrick?

00:01:54.864 --> 00:01:55.782
{\an8}Patrick?

00:01:55.865 --> 00:01:57.117
{\an8}

00:01:58.118 --> 00:01:59.661
{\an8}-
Good morning.

00:02:00.787 --> 00:02:02.372
{\an8}- How are you?

00:02:02.455 --> 00:02:03.873
{\an8}- How are you feeling?
Hm?

00:02:03.957 --> 00:02:06.084
{\an8}Are you okay now?
You can't get sick again.

00:02:06.167 --> 00:02:07.210
{\an8}- Sit down.
Mia.

00:02:07.836 --> 00:02:08.753
{\an8}Here.

00:02:08.837 --> 00:02:10.588
{\an8}You should skip work today.

00:02:10.672 --> 00:02:12.674
{\an8}

00:02:12.757 --> 00:02:14.050
{\an8}I'm fine now.

00:02:14.884 --> 00:02:16.553
{\an8}You recovered so quick.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.181
{\an8}That's because someone took care of me.

00:02:22.142 --> 00:02:24.227
{\an8}You're only saying that so I won't worry.

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.146
{\an8}I swear, I'm fine now.

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:28.106
{\an8}I did recover quickly,

00:02:28.773 --> 00:02:30.400
{\an8}thanks to someone's hugs.

00:02:30.984 --> 00:02:33.987
{\an8}Patrick, that's so corny.

00:02:35.655 --> 00:02:40.326
Well, it's true.
That's what made me feel better.

00:02:44.747 --> 00:02:47.667
Mia, can we talk? Seriously this time.

00:02:48.668 --> 00:02:50.420
I need to tell you something.

00:02:58.803 --> 00:03:01.055
{\an8}

00:03:05.518 --> 00:03:06.811
{\an8}It still smells like puke.

00:03:07.437 --> 00:03:09.355
{\an8}Should I get some vinegar

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:11.482
{\an8}to remove the smell of puke?

00:03:14.652 --> 00:03:16.446
{\an8}- Vincent?
Yeah?

00:03:17.071 --> 00:03:18.573
{\an8}Oh, Gemma!

00:03:18.656 --> 00:03:19.699
{\an8}Good morning.

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.578
{\an8}Were you planning on puking in your car?

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:27.790
{\an8}No, vinegar.
It can be used as a deodorizer

00:03:27.874 --> 00:03:30.084
{\an8}to remove bad smells.

00:03:30.168 --> 00:03:32.795
{\an8}Why? Does your car smell bad?

00:03:35.465 --> 00:03:37.383
{\an8}You really don't remember?

00:03:38.468 --> 00:03:40.386
{\an8}

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:41.387
{\an8}

00:03:41.471 --> 00:03:42.555
Um…

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:45.642
Gemma, you puked in
my car after I picked you up.

00:03:46.517 --> 00:03:48.603
Huh?!

00:03:48.686 --> 00:03:51.522
It's fine. I've cleaned it.

00:03:51.606 --> 00:03:52.941
It still smells a bit,

00:03:53.024 --> 00:03:55.235
but it'll be gone soon. Don't worry.

00:03:55.318 --> 00:03:56.194
- No need to--
- No.

00:03:56.277 --> 00:03:57.820
Here's some cash. Have it washed.

00:03:57.904 --> 00:04:00.198
Twice if need be. I'll pay for it.

00:04:02.617 --> 00:04:05.662
I'll only accept this on one condition.

00:04:06.496 --> 00:04:08.289
Have coffee with me.

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:11.709
- Coffee?
- Yeah.

00:04:11.793 --> 00:04:13.795
At a café, not at home.

00:04:13.878 --> 00:04:18.341
That's all you have
to do to make it up to me.

00:04:20.885 --> 00:04:22.929
Does that look mean yes?

00:04:23.012 --> 00:04:25.014
Yes?

00:04:26.808 --> 00:04:28.434
I'll add this to our budget.

00:04:41.447 --> 00:04:43.533
What do you want to talk about?

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:47.787
I know I said
things before that hurt you,

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:52.000
but it's true,
I have to prioritize Matmat.

00:04:55.962 --> 00:04:57.880
Are we going to have a conversation

00:04:57.964 --> 00:05:00.049
about priorities again?

00:05:00.133 --> 00:05:02.760
I already told you what
happened to Mama, right?

00:05:02.844 --> 00:05:04.220
Yes.

00:05:05.388 --> 00:05:06.514
I know.

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:10.143
Matmat saw what really happened.

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:13.855
You mean…

00:05:14.564 --> 00:05:15.940
He doesn't remember.

00:05:17.734 --> 00:05:20.987
For him it was a traumatic experience.

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:25.325
If you ask him what happened that night,

00:05:25.408 --> 00:05:27.827
all he'll say is there was a butterfly.

00:05:29.037 --> 00:05:30.872
That's what he believes killed Mama.

00:05:34.417 --> 00:05:35.668
But…

00:05:35.752 --> 00:05:38.212
how can a butterfly kill your mother?

00:05:45.428 --> 00:05:48.848
The butterfly! It's going to come back!

00:05:48.931 --> 00:05:51.142
What did Mama's killer look like?!

00:05:51.225 --> 00:05:52.727
- Think!
- The victim fought back,

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:54.020
that's why she was killed.

00:05:54.103 --> 00:05:56.481
There's no way
a butterfly killed your mother.

00:05:56.564 --> 00:05:59.317
- No! No!
- Matmat! Matmat!

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.695
- No!
- Matmat! Matmat!

00:06:04.614 --> 00:06:08.367
We left Maravida because
social services tried to separate us.

00:06:10.453 --> 00:06:13.289
But I never thought that every year,

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:17.627
we'd have to keep moving
because of Matmat's trauma.

00:06:21.923 --> 00:06:24.258
So that's why he wants a camping van.

00:06:27.345 --> 00:06:31.849
Whenever the anniversary
of Mama's death gets close,

00:06:32.767 --> 00:06:34.560
when rainy season starts,

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:37.605
Matmat's trauma resurfaces.

00:06:38.856 --> 00:06:40.191
He keeps having nightmares

00:06:40.274 --> 00:06:42.318
of being chased by butterflies.

00:06:42.401 --> 00:06:45.071
Matmat! Matmat!

00:06:45.154 --> 00:06:46.280
Matmat!

00:06:46.364 --> 00:06:47.323
- Let's leave!
- Matmat.

00:06:47.406 --> 00:06:49.742
- I don't want it here anymore!
- Matmat.

00:06:49.826 --> 00:06:52.870
Let's go, Patpat!

00:06:52.954 --> 00:06:55.748
I can't leave his side, Mia.

00:06:57.375 --> 00:07:00.461
Not while he's still
carrying that trauma.

00:07:02.046 --> 00:07:03.798
I hope you understand.

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:19.105
I understand.

00:07:25.903 --> 00:07:27.572
Didn't you tell me

00:07:28.948 --> 00:07:30.783
that no matter how much I try to avoid it,

00:07:31.784 --> 00:07:33.286
no matter how much I run,

00:07:35.329 --> 00:07:37.373
destiny will still find us?

00:07:44.213 --> 00:07:46.924
Are you saying this is our destiny?

00:07:48.968 --> 00:07:51.053
That we're not meant to be together?

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:58.478
You're destined to be part of my life.

00:08:02.482 --> 00:08:03.858
So…

00:08:04.859 --> 00:08:06.944
while I'm by Matmat's side,

00:08:09.822 --> 00:08:11.073
will you…

00:08:14.619 --> 00:08:16.704
will you be the one who stays by mine?

00:08:24.545 --> 00:08:26.130
If that's what you want.

00:08:27.548 --> 00:08:30.885
I will never leave your side.

00:09:24.981 --> 00:09:27.149
Good job, Mia,

00:09:27.233 --> 00:09:29.610
for not giving into that woman.

00:09:37.201 --> 00:09:39.203
Otherwise…

00:09:43.583 --> 00:09:45.376
That kiss wouldn't have happened.

00:10:53.944 --> 00:10:55.946
Stay by his side.

00:11:00.034 --> 00:11:01.911
And I'll stay by yours.

00:11:14.006 --> 00:11:15.174
Hey, Matmat.

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:18.386
Are you ready?

00:11:18.469 --> 00:11:21.972
I'm going to Jason's now.

00:11:22.056 --> 00:11:24.475
Were you able to catch the escapee?

00:11:26.102 --> 00:11:29.105
Matmat, she's a patient,
not a criminal on the run.

00:11:29.188 --> 00:11:31.023
Oh, right. But did you catch her?

00:11:32.149 --> 00:11:33.984
Not yet, Matmat.

00:11:34.902 --> 00:11:36.737
We didn't get to her in time.

00:11:36.821 --> 00:11:39.323
Oh… Oh, boy.

00:11:39.407 --> 00:11:40.658
What will you do?

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:43.744
We'll still look for her.

00:11:43.828 --> 00:11:45.579
Have you had breakfast yet?

00:11:45.663 --> 00:11:47.832
M-Mm-hmm.

00:11:47.915 --> 00:11:49.333
I-I had fried rice,

00:11:49.417 --> 00:11:52.962
sausage, and eggs at Mama Li's.

00:11:54.255 --> 00:11:56.549
Okay, Matmat.
I'm going to the hospital now.

00:11:56.632 --> 00:11:59.343
I'll try to get home early so
we can have dinner together.

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:01.846
Matmat has to go.

00:12:03.764 --> 00:12:04.849
Bye-bye.

00:12:05.307 --> 00:12:07.810
Okay. Take care--

00:12:07.893 --> 00:12:08.978
Matmat?

00:12:09.979 --> 00:12:11.188
Hello, Matmat?

00:12:25.494 --> 00:12:26.662
Let me do that, ma'am.

00:12:26.745 --> 00:12:27.663
No need.

00:12:27.746 --> 00:12:29.874
I can take Samuel to Doctor Emman.

00:12:29.957 --> 00:12:31.167
Alright.

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:32.376
Thanks.

00:12:46.891 --> 00:12:49.143
Everything's going to be alright.

00:12:49.226 --> 00:12:52.271
I'll be waiting while
you're having your checkup.

00:12:59.653 --> 00:13:00.946
Nurse Gemma.

00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:03.657
How are the patients?

00:13:03.741 --> 00:13:05.993
We're done with
the morning rounds, ma'am.

00:13:06.076 --> 00:13:07.870
I mean, patient Samuel.

00:13:07.953 --> 00:13:10.706
Ah! He's got a checkup with Doctor Emman

00:13:10.789 --> 00:13:11.957
following last night's incident.

00:13:12.041 --> 00:13:14.919
Patty also said they'll run some tests

00:13:15.002 --> 00:13:18.130
and consult with
his neurologist and surgeon.

00:13:18.214 --> 00:13:20.716
I hope the results
and feedback is positive.

00:13:20.799 --> 00:13:23.010
Samuel has been unwell for so long.

00:13:23.719 --> 00:13:26.722
Hopefully, his tumor hasn't come back.

00:13:27.473 --> 00:13:29.475
How about patient Zelda?

00:13:31.477 --> 00:13:33.437
They still haven't found her.

00:13:34.772 --> 00:13:36.607
After she left Mia's,

00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:38.776
Zelda was last seen at Barangay Hillside.

00:13:40.361 --> 00:13:43.113
Who knows where Zelda is now.

00:13:45.449 --> 00:13:48.953
Maybe we should vacate her bed now.

00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:50.663
Ma'am?

00:13:52.206 --> 00:13:53.541
But Doc Anok advised us

00:13:53.624 --> 00:13:55.626
to be ready for
when she comes back.

00:13:58.003 --> 00:14:00.714
Zelda wasn't even
stable when she ran away,

00:14:00.798 --> 00:14:02.299
how do you expect her to come back?

00:14:03.717 --> 00:14:05.594
I was just thinking, Nurse Gemma,

00:14:06.345 --> 00:14:08.681
the hospital's waiting list is so long.

00:14:09.431 --> 00:14:10.599
Instead of having an empty bed,

00:14:10.683 --> 00:14:12.434
maybe we should start arranging things

00:14:12.518 --> 00:14:13.852
for a new patient.

00:14:15.145 --> 00:14:17.189
Anyway, I'll discuss
this with Doctor Anok.

00:14:17.273 --> 00:14:21.151
For now, you can ask
the nurse aide to clear Zelda's things.

00:14:21.235 --> 00:14:22.778
Okay? Thank you.

00:14:26.907 --> 00:14:28.909
Is she really not coming back?

00:14:28.993 --> 00:14:33.956
She's only been gone for
a day and already has been evicted,

00:14:34.039 --> 00:14:35.708
without any warning.

00:14:37.042 --> 00:14:39.169
I'm just following orders.

00:14:39.253 --> 00:14:43.382
Don't worry, if she returns and
you already have a new roommate,

00:14:43.465 --> 00:14:46.176
I'm sure Doc Anok will be considerate.

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:47.678
Okay.

00:14:51.974 --> 00:14:53.767
- Patrick.
- Yes?

00:14:54.393 --> 00:14:57.229
You look glowing today.

00:14:58.439 --> 00:14:59.857
What?

00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:04.111
It's like there's
a happy filter on your face.

00:15:05.154 --> 00:15:07.323
Does my face look like
a cellphone screen to you?

00:15:08.198 --> 00:15:11.368
I'm serious!
That's exactly what I'm seeing.

00:15:12.328 --> 00:15:16.874
Mind you,
I haven't used my shaman powers yet.

00:15:16.957 --> 00:15:20.920
But something good happened, huh?

00:15:21.003 --> 00:15:22.379
Nothing.

00:15:22.463 --> 00:15:24.089
- Come on.
- Go get some fresh air.

00:15:24.173 --> 00:15:25.674
Want me to join you?

00:15:25.758 --> 00:15:27.843
It's fine, I can manage.

00:15:27.927 --> 00:15:31.555
If the sun hits you,
it will highlight your glow even more.

00:15:31.639 --> 00:15:32.806
Thank you.

00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:34.850
Hey, can you smile again?

00:15:34.934 --> 00:15:37.311
- Look at that smile.
- Go on.

00:15:37.394 --> 00:15:38.896
Alright.

00:15:47.696 --> 00:15:50.282
Y-Your order's complete, ma'am.

00:15:50.366 --> 00:15:53.494
Enjoy Jason's grilled chicken.

00:15:53.577 --> 00:15:54.620
Thank you!

00:15:57.456 --> 00:15:58.916
I'd like to order!

00:16:01.794 --> 00:16:03.212
Hi, Matmat.

00:16:07.341 --> 00:16:10.552
W-What's your order, miss?

00:16:11.637 --> 00:16:13.806
I don't see what I want on the menu.

00:16:16.725 --> 00:16:18.936
W-What do you want?

00:16:21.146 --> 00:16:23.524
I want you and Patrick
to come back to the mansion.

00:16:27.903 --> 00:16:28.904
Matmat?

00:16:29.488 --> 00:16:31.615
- Are you ignoring me?
- Jason!

00:16:31.699 --> 00:16:32.992
Jason!

00:16:33.075 --> 00:16:35.953
- Yes, Matmat?
- Come on, let's talk.

00:16:36.036 --> 00:16:37.871
Mia, I'll take your order.

00:16:37.955 --> 00:16:39.707
- You can order anything.
- Matmat?

00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:41.792
- I'll take your order.
- Hey, Matmat.

00:16:41.875 --> 00:16:43.585
- Who do you want to talk to?
- Matmat--

00:16:43.669 --> 00:16:44.461
Not you.

00:16:44.545 --> 00:16:46.171
I want to talk to Matmat.

00:16:47.506 --> 00:16:48.507
Mia, wait!

00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:49.717
- That's--
- Matmat?

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:50.968
That's for employees only!

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:03.856
{\an8}"THE ENCHANTED WITCH"

00:17:29.048 --> 00:17:30.090
Matmat!

00:17:30.174 --> 00:17:31.383
Mia, you can't go there.

00:17:31.467 --> 00:17:33.177
- Matmat, wait.
- Mia!

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:34.303
- Let's talk.
- Mia!

00:17:34.386 --> 00:17:36.764
Diners aren't allowed back here.

00:17:37.347 --> 00:17:40.309
I won't leave until Matmat talks to me.

00:17:40.893 --> 00:17:43.228
Matmat, did you hear that?

00:17:43.771 --> 00:17:45.481
Hey, let's talk!

00:17:45.564 --> 00:17:47.900
Sure, you'll convince
him with all that shouting.

00:17:48.776 --> 00:17:50.110
N-No!

00:17:53.864 --> 00:17:55.949
I'll buy 50 roasted chickens.

00:17:56.033 --> 00:17:57.117
Just get out of my way.

00:17:57.201 --> 00:17:59.578
- Fifty?!
- Matmat, let's talk.

00:17:59.661 --> 00:18:01.038
Let's talk properly.

00:18:01.121 --> 00:18:03.332
Mia, seriously,
I don't think Matmat's okay.

00:18:03.415 --> 00:18:05.084
Can you just leave him alone for now?

00:18:05.167 --> 00:18:08.378
I-I don't want to go back to your house.

00:18:13.383 --> 00:18:14.718
Fine.

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:17.638
I'll just tell you while you're working.

00:18:18.555 --> 00:18:21.642
Matmat, you're still my illustrator.

00:18:21.725 --> 00:18:23.560
So I want to discuss with you

00:18:23.644 --> 00:18:26.396
the new concept for my next book.

00:18:27.606 --> 00:18:28.941
And it's because of you.

00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:34.696
Because of this…

00:18:36.073 --> 00:18:37.449
this drawing you gave me.

00:18:39.201 --> 00:18:40.494
Threw away.

00:18:40.577 --> 00:18:42.704
Matmat didn't give you that.

00:18:42.788 --> 00:18:44.164
He threw it away.

00:18:46.834 --> 00:18:48.710
Because of this drawing you threw away,

00:18:49.419 --> 00:18:51.672
I thought of a new concept.

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:57.594
There are three souls that will journey

00:18:59.596 --> 00:19:02.975
to find what truly matters to them.

00:19:04.309 --> 00:19:05.644
Beautiful, right?

00:19:10.941 --> 00:19:12.067
No.

00:19:14.319 --> 00:19:16.905
I won't take no as an answer, Matmat.

00:19:27.749 --> 00:19:28.876
I'll sue you.

00:19:31.044 --> 00:19:32.254
- Sue me?
- Yes.

00:19:32.337 --> 00:19:34.131
I'll report you to the police.

00:19:34.214 --> 00:19:37.718
I'll say that you, Matmat Gonzales…

00:19:37.801 --> 00:19:39.720
failed to honor his contract.

00:19:42.598 --> 00:19:45.434
That's called breach of contract.

00:19:45.517 --> 00:19:49.313
You signed a contract but you're not
doing your part as an illustrator.

00:19:52.566 --> 00:19:54.568
So if you don't want to get sued…

00:19:55.068 --> 00:19:57.446
Matmat, come with me.

00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:00.574
Let's go home and get back to work.

00:20:04.203 --> 00:20:05.579
N-No.

00:20:07.289 --> 00:20:09.917
You still refuse,
even if I report you to the police?

00:20:12.044 --> 00:20:14.171
Jason, the phone.

00:20:14.254 --> 00:20:15.797
- Yes.
- There's an order!

00:20:15.881 --> 00:20:17.966
Mm-hmm.

00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:19.176
Your order.

00:20:20.636 --> 00:20:22.512
- Too loud!
- I'll get it, Matmat.

00:20:32.397 --> 00:20:33.482
Eden!

00:20:34.775 --> 00:20:37.110
Who are you
to make decisions for my patient?

00:20:39.529 --> 00:20:41.198
Let's not talk here?

00:20:41.281 --> 00:20:43.617
No, we'll talk here!

00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:46.703
You have no authority
to have Zelda's bed cleared.

00:20:46.787 --> 00:20:48.247
She'll be back.

00:20:49.498 --> 00:20:50.582
Are you sure?

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:53.543
How do you know she'll be back?

00:20:54.002 --> 00:20:55.087
Did she tell you?

00:20:55.754 --> 00:20:57.506
Did you even really take care of her?

00:20:58.924 --> 00:21:01.551
She's only been gone for one day!

00:21:01.635 --> 00:21:02.511
Okay.

00:21:02.594 --> 00:21:05.889
Olivia, the patients here are voluntarily.

00:21:05.973 --> 00:21:10.227
So if they leave or run away,
it shouldn't be our concern anymore.

00:21:10.894 --> 00:21:14.398
So as early as now,
it's better if we admit a new patient.

00:21:14.481 --> 00:21:16.858
Because there are many
on the waiting list.

00:21:16.942 --> 00:21:18.277
Don't you want that?

00:21:19.069 --> 00:21:20.737
One less patient for you?

00:21:22.489 --> 00:21:23.573
You're only saying that

00:21:23.657 --> 00:21:25.784
because you're
sucking up for a promotion!

00:21:25.867 --> 00:21:28.954
I'm only saying the truth, Olivia!

00:21:29.621 --> 00:21:32.958
So with one less patient,
isn't that better?

00:21:33.583 --> 00:21:36.753
You'll have more time
to take care of patient Samuel.

00:21:36.837 --> 00:21:39.423
Since you're very
hands-on with him, right?

00:21:42.134 --> 00:21:43.969
How very professional.

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:46.555
If that's your attitude toward me,

00:21:46.638 --> 00:21:47.973
here's mine!

00:21:48.682 --> 00:21:49.808
What now?!

00:21:51.018 --> 00:21:52.561
I've held back
long enough with you!

00:21:52.644 --> 00:21:53.979
You're the one who's overstepping!

00:21:55.605 --> 00:21:57.024
That's enough!

00:21:57.107 --> 00:21:58.984
- Doc!
- It's you!

00:21:59.067 --> 00:22:00.694
Pogi, call Doc Anok!

00:22:00.777 --> 00:22:01.945
Call him, quick!

00:22:04.656 --> 00:22:07.075
- You witch!
- You've gone too far!

00:22:07.159 --> 00:22:08.452
Nurse, that's enough!

00:22:16.668 --> 00:22:18.420
- Put it under the light--
- Oh, rotten tomato!

00:22:18.962 --> 00:22:22.424
A rotten tomato is soggy.

00:22:22.507 --> 00:22:24.343
Doc.

00:22:24.426 --> 00:22:26.178
Patrick, let me check you.

00:22:26.261 --> 00:22:27.596
Me?

00:22:27.679 --> 00:22:28.680
Wow.

00:22:29.848 --> 00:22:31.641
It's true.

00:22:31.725 --> 00:22:34.394
Cynthia's been saying
you look like your blooming.

00:22:34.478 --> 00:22:36.021
- Doc, come on.
- Look at you.

00:22:36.104 --> 00:22:37.522
I just woke up in a good mood.

00:22:37.606 --> 00:22:40.067
Wow, I'm jealous.

00:22:43.487 --> 00:22:44.988
- Patrick.
- Yes?

00:22:46.114 --> 00:22:47.449
I'm still wondering.

00:22:48.158 --> 00:22:50.619
Why did Zelda go to visit Mia?

00:22:52.370 --> 00:22:54.915
Doc, I can't think of
any other reason except that

00:22:54.998 --> 00:22:57.042
she just wanted to greet Mia.

00:22:57.125 --> 00:22:58.001
It was her birthday.

00:22:58.085 --> 00:22:59.169
In person?

00:22:59.836 --> 00:23:01.004
- Patrick!
- What?

00:23:01.797 --> 00:23:03.548
Doc, there's trouble!

00:23:03.632 --> 00:23:04.633
Where?

00:23:04.716 --> 00:23:06.218
Miss Eden and Miss Olivia.

00:23:06.301 --> 00:23:07.594
Huh?

00:23:08.804 --> 00:23:09.805
They're here!

00:23:09.888 --> 00:23:12.057
You're doing that to yourself

00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:14.267
because we shouldn't
care about her anymore!

00:23:14.351 --> 00:23:17.187
- You've got a big problem!
- Olivia, Eden!

00:23:31.785 --> 00:23:32.911
Pick-up for Hobi?

00:23:32.994 --> 00:23:34.746
Okay, thank you.

00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:36.665
Matmat, wrap this up for me, okay?

00:23:36.748 --> 00:23:38.125
- Thank you.
- Alright, Jason.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.043
Fine!

00:23:40.127 --> 00:23:41.253
If you want to quit,

00:23:42.129 --> 00:23:44.506
then pay me back for everything I spent.

00:23:45.465 --> 00:23:47.384
Matmat won't return anything.

00:23:47.467 --> 00:23:48.426
He owes nothing.

00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:51.888
You lived in my house
and ate the food I bought.

00:23:53.014 --> 00:23:54.474
That was Mia's decision.

00:23:54.558 --> 00:23:57.144
On the condition
that you were my illustrator.

00:23:57.227 --> 00:24:00.105
But you haven't made
a single drawing for me.

00:24:00.188 --> 00:24:04.192
So you'll pay me 50,000 pesos.

00:24:07.904 --> 00:24:09.906
50,000?

00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:12.367
Matmat will pay 50,000?

00:24:12.450 --> 00:24:13.952
Oh no.

00:24:14.828 --> 00:24:16.955
Make that 100,000 pesos.

00:24:17.038 --> 00:24:18.957
For you and Patrick.

00:24:20.208 --> 00:24:23.378
Matmat doesn't have 100,000.

00:24:27.507 --> 00:24:28.800
Choose…

00:24:29.801 --> 00:24:33.597
pay me, or draw for me.

00:24:54.367 --> 00:24:57.746
You'll have more
time to take care of patient Samuel.

00:24:57.829 --> 00:25:00.498
Since you're so hands-on with him, right?

00:25:02.751 --> 00:25:06.213
You get so defensive
when I mention Samuel.

00:25:13.303 --> 00:25:17.599
You're only showing
a special connection with him.

00:25:19.893 --> 00:25:21.686
Congratulations, Olivia.

00:25:21.770 --> 00:25:24.147
I'm glad because you're so passionate

00:25:24.231 --> 00:25:26.149
in taking care of your patients.

00:25:26.233 --> 00:25:28.026
And that's one of the things I consider

00:25:28.109 --> 00:25:30.946
when I recommend
someone for a manager position.

00:25:31.029 --> 00:25:34.366
And Olivia,
I only agreed to this turnover

00:25:34.449 --> 00:25:37.327
because I want
the best outcome for Samuel.

00:25:37.410 --> 00:25:40.497
You can count on me, Doc.
I'll take good care of the patient.

00:25:46.962 --> 00:25:48.546
- Sorry.

00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:50.257
Sorry, sorry.

00:25:52.008 --> 00:25:53.969
I understand.

00:26:05.438 --> 00:26:07.357
Everything's going to be alright.

00:26:12.988 --> 00:26:15.115
A little more, Olivia.

00:26:15.198 --> 00:26:17.450
Keep being careless,

00:26:17.534 --> 00:26:20.495
and eventually I'll
find out what you're hiding.

00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:26.293
No.

00:26:26.376 --> 00:26:28.378
Matmat won't do anything!

00:26:28.461 --> 00:26:29.462
What?

00:26:29.546 --> 00:26:31.298
So you don't keep your word?

00:26:31.381 --> 00:26:33.133
What kind of behavior is that, Matmat?

00:26:34.175 --> 00:26:36.928
Pick-up for customer Hobi!

00:26:39.222 --> 00:26:40.473
Stop ignoring me!

00:26:40.557 --> 00:26:41.933
You won't get him.

00:26:42.642 --> 00:26:44.519
What? Isn't this the order?

00:26:44.602 --> 00:26:46.938
You won't get Patpat.

00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:50.317
You talk like Patrick is an object.

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:51.860
He's not an object.

00:26:51.943 --> 00:26:54.487
Ma'am, sir,
please don't fight over the dog.

00:26:54.571 --> 00:26:55.405
I feel bad for it--

00:26:55.488 --> 00:26:57.699
He's not a dog. He's a person.

00:26:57.782 --> 00:26:59.034
- Leave!
- Pay first!

00:26:59.117 --> 00:27:00.118
Okay.

00:27:01.536 --> 00:27:04.205
Patpat is my brother. You won't take him.

00:27:04.289 --> 00:27:05.915
He's just your brother.
You don't own him.

00:27:05.999 --> 00:27:07.917
I'm older. I make the decisions.

00:27:08.001 --> 00:27:11.713
Patrick will decide
for his own life, not you!

00:27:11.796 --> 00:27:13.798
You shouldn't interfere.

00:27:14.674 --> 00:27:16.009
You're not our sister.

00:27:16.092 --> 00:27:18.386
What kind of brother
are you to talk like that?

00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:19.763
Hey, Matmat!

00:27:19.846 --> 00:27:21.556
Matmat? Matmat!

00:27:21.639 --> 00:27:22.932
Don't lock the door!

00:27:25.518 --> 00:27:28.772
I won't pay for the 50
roasted chicken I ordered.

00:27:29.481 --> 00:27:30.482
Open this!

00:27:32.525 --> 00:27:34.027
Alright, here you go.

00:27:36.112 --> 00:27:37.072
Easy.

00:27:46.873 --> 00:27:48.750
Payment for the delivery.

00:27:57.217 --> 00:27:59.302
Breach of contract, 100,000 pesos.

00:27:59.386 --> 00:28:02.430
Matmat will run out
of money if he pays Mia.

00:28:02.514 --> 00:28:04.849
Can you also be
a brother to someone else?

00:28:04.933 --> 00:28:06.393
Mia's got a lot of money.

00:28:06.476 --> 00:28:07.727
You should have asked her earlier.

00:28:07.811 --> 00:28:10.605
How did you know she was there?

00:28:10.688 --> 00:28:11.856
Almost done?

00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:12.816
Just a bit more.

00:28:12.899 --> 00:28:14.025
There's no butterfly yet.

00:28:14.109 --> 00:28:16.111
If the work's not finished, I won't pay.

00:28:16.194 --> 00:28:18.822
Matmat, that's work,
not a game you can just leave.

00:28:18.905 --> 00:28:20.365
- No!
- I'm talking to you.

00:28:20.448 --> 00:28:21.282
Don't turn your back on me!

00:28:21.366 --> 00:28:22.492
Aah!
