00:00:02.775 --> 00:00:06.103
I've found the star of my life.

00:00:06.448 --> 00:00:09.569
There it is! The unexpected wink from tsundere Shun!

00:00:09.633 --> 00:00:10.750
Mr. President?

00:00:10.841 --> 00:00:12.624
Mr. President...

00:00:12.649 --> 00:00:14.739
-Mr. President! -Mr. President?

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.108
My idol... is the president's grandson?

00:00:18.134 --> 00:00:19.305
President?

00:00:19.318 --> 00:00:21.560
Someone! There's a suspicious person here!

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.318
I'm not a suspicious person.

00:00:25.566 --> 00:00:28.787
I am so incredibly sorry.

00:00:30.078 --> 00:00:32.615
Mr. President, I'm sorry about the other day as well.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.397
At the hospital, I mistook you for...

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.408
I'm not the president yet, am I?

00:00:41.434 --> 00:00:44.515
I forgot. I'm sorry.

00:00:44.835 --> 00:00:46.937
I'll be taking my leave.

00:00:52.571 --> 00:00:56.701
No way...

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.435
No, I must have misheard.

00:00:58.435 --> 00:01:01.986
No, I definitely misheard. He even said he's not the president yet...

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:05.449
Wait, so he's going to be?

00:01:05.488 --> 00:01:06.515
But...

00:01:06.528 --> 00:01:08.232
Hey, have you heard?

00:01:08.232 --> 00:01:09.596
Heard what?

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:13.682
The rumor that the actor Shun Himuro is going to be our new president...

00:01:13.733 --> 00:01:15.541
Shun Himuro is becoming our president?

00:01:16.205 --> 00:01:19.019
Minami-senpai, what are you doing?

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.329
-Nothing. -Did you say Shun Himuro?

00:01:23.351 --> 00:01:25.518
Oh my god...

00:01:25.542 --> 00:01:28.067
Minami-senpai isn't interested in celebrities, right?

00:01:28.067 --> 00:01:28.890
That's right.

00:01:28.916 --> 00:01:31.069
No... I'm SUPER interested.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.164
If Shun becomes the president, and I'm the president's secretary...

00:01:38.481 --> 00:01:40.759
How could I be so presumptuous? Absolutely not.

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:43.246
Wait, what about his acting career?

00:01:43.246 --> 00:01:45.465
Right, that must be why he canceled the stage play.

00:01:45.465 --> 00:01:49.667
I can't accept this. They're still going to sell his calendar for next year, right?

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.326
I'm such an idiot... Why did I do that?

00:01:56.364 --> 00:01:59.864
Everyone's already freaking out and it's just a rumor.

00:02:01.001 --> 00:02:03.820
But you're really not interested?

00:02:04.446 --> 00:02:05.518
Yeah.

00:02:05.582 --> 00:02:06.737
Really?

00:02:06.788 --> 00:02:08.139
Really.

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.113
-But it's Shun Himuro! -You're so annoying!

00:02:11.122 --> 00:02:14.277
I'm not interested in some Shun Himuro guy!

00:02:21.188 --> 00:02:23.226
I am so very sorry.

00:02:33.435 --> 00:02:35.089
This hasn't been announced publicly yet...

00:02:35.127 --> 00:02:37.920
but Mr. Shun Himuro is, in fact, the president's grandson.

00:02:37.946 --> 00:02:40.315
He is slated to become the next president.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.521
I've messed up again.

00:02:44.378 --> 00:02:48.413
What am I going to do if Shun really becomes the president?

00:02:50.482 --> 00:02:51.894
Ai.

00:02:52.192 --> 00:02:54.192
Ms. Sato.

00:02:54.786 --> 00:02:57.476
(Takako Sato, Head of Sales at TAKASHIRO)
The secretarial office seems busy. Are you holding up okay?

00:02:58.323 --> 00:03:00.209
Well, actually...

00:03:02.513 --> 00:03:04.513
No, it's nothing.

00:03:04.556 --> 00:03:07.365
If you're ever in trouble, let me know. I can help.

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.522
Let's get dinner again soon.

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.082
Yes, of course.

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.321
Ms. Sato is always so kind and helpful.

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:17.948
Shun Himuro is an idol, right?

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.384
An actor, but close enough to an idol.

00:03:20.398 --> 00:03:22.282
He has no experience in this industry, right?

00:03:22.298 --> 00:03:24.628
And he's just going to start as president?

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.671
He's probably just a figurehead for publicity.

00:03:26.743 --> 00:03:28.598
I'm so jealous.

00:03:28.627 --> 00:03:31.917
Celebrities get to become presidents just like that, without doing a thing.

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:37.005
You're not wrong. Please, continue.

00:03:37.005 --> 00:03:40.844
You're not wrong. Please, continue.

00:03:40.897 --> 00:03:42.750
S-Sorry!

00:03:42.824 --> 00:03:45.356
As expected of the young master. Totally unfazed.

00:03:45.366 --> 00:03:47.270
He's got nerves of steel.

00:04:01.806 --> 00:04:06.261
We will also ask your older brother, Mr. Hayate, to return to the country as soon as possible.

00:04:06.396 --> 00:04:08.396
For the time being, I will handle the practical operations.

00:04:08.396 --> 00:04:10.337
During this period, we ask for your utmost effort.

00:04:10.337 --> 00:04:12.818
Shun, you are a layman in this industry.

00:04:12.857 --> 00:04:17.162
Furthermore, you will have to juggle two jobs until your current work is finished.

00:04:17.188 --> 00:04:19.188
I know this is a difficult request.

00:04:19.439 --> 00:04:22.228
However, TAKASHIRO's performance is currently poor.

00:04:22.324 --> 00:04:25.787
There have even been several buyout offers.

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:32.197
It would be disastrous if our stock price were to fall due to the president's illness.

00:04:32.216 --> 00:04:34.813
We must appoint a new president as soon as possible.

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.160
Pardon my bluntness, but in terms of raising the company's profile...

00:04:38.179 --> 00:04:41.950
and creating buzz, you will be very helpful on the promotional side.

00:04:42.008 --> 00:04:44.412
That's a bit harsh.

00:04:44.412 --> 00:04:47.201
We implore you to accept.

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.460
I'll do it.

00:04:54.518 --> 00:04:59.289
But I refuse to be an empty figurehead.

00:04:59.366 --> 00:05:03.995
As long as it's within my power, I will do the best I possibly can.

00:05:05.026 --> 00:05:07.026
Grandfather...

00:05:07.044 --> 00:05:11.033
You were the one who warned me not to act rashly.

00:05:11.227 --> 00:05:14.801
Why would you ask this of me?

00:05:46.683 --> 00:05:48.285
Pitch black.

00:05:48.297 --> 00:05:50.552
The world of my heart is also pitch black.

00:05:50.552 --> 00:05:53.560
I've decided that here in France...

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:55.826
I'm going to hold a successful one-woman show.

00:05:56.032 --> 00:05:58.032
And make my international debut.

00:06:00.403 --> 00:06:02.162
Life is tough...

00:06:02.162 --> 00:06:04.572
but it's fun to do what you love every day.

00:06:04.572 --> 00:06:06.208
It's exciting.

I know exactly how you feel.

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:10.860
Once you decide, see it through to the end.

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:13.029
This is the life I'm pouring my soul into.

00:06:13.791 --> 00:06:16.447
Everyone, you should do what you want to do, too!

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:20.722

no, Mr. Shun Takashiro...

will be formally appointed as the representative director.

I want to be a help to Shun.

00:08:04.568 --> 00:08:08.596
But since he dislikes me, am I even qualified to write the draft?

I'm not the president yet.

00:10:32.574 --> 00:10:36.782
I wanted to memorize my script at the office, and also look over some internal documents.

How did you know?

00:10:52.855 --> 00:10:55.055
The senior managing director mentioned it in an email.

Shun is such a fast worker.

00:10:58.226 --> 00:11:01.909
Since you're here, could you brief me directly?

Ms. Minami.

Still, this is an incredible amount of material.

00:11:26.389 --> 00:11:27.660
I apologize.

00:11:27.813 --> 00:11:30.255

Isn't TAKASHIRO a bit outdated?

00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:53.366
No, we're not outdated at all.

00:11:56.009 --> 00:11:57.808
Under the current president's leadership,

00:11:57.852 --> 00:12:01.825
revenue has increased across all business segments.

00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:04.930
Things like importing foreign brands,

00:12:05.018 --> 00:12:07.384
acquiring licenses for foreign brands,

00:12:07.417 --> 00:12:11.213
expanding overseas branches, and accepting OEM production.

Our performance has tripled in the last three years.

00:12:18.933 --> 00:12:23.361
This is all thanks to the president's excellent market intuition.

00:12:24.334 --> 00:12:26.780
-And the employees also... -What you're saying...

00:12:27.183 --> 00:12:29.320
doesn't really answer my question, does it?

00:12:29.482 --> 00:12:31.482
I... I'm sorry.

00:12:32.292 --> 00:12:35.638
No, it's alright.

00:12:36.085 --> 00:12:38.420
This has given me a better understanding of the business situation.

00:12:39.777 --> 00:12:40.884
Thank you.

00:12:42.758 --> 00:12:46.269
My fave said "thank you" to me.

00:12:50.183 --> 00:12:52.077
We should probably wrap up soon.

00:12:52.167 --> 00:12:54.005
There's no way I can finish all of this.

00:12:54.754 --> 00:12:56.052
Right.

00:12:58.943 --> 00:13:01.573
Can I really do this?

00:13:05.855 --> 00:13:07.855
Maybe I should just run away.

00:13:11.745 --> 00:13:13.657
You can do it.

00:13:15.495 --> 00:13:18.107
How can you be so sure?

00:13:18.357 --> 00:13:20.976
I've only had one night to prepare.

00:13:21.279 --> 00:13:23.279
Why...?

00:13:26.223 --> 00:13:29.258
Because you have an extraordinary memory.

00:13:29.258 --> 00:13:32.275
And the superb acting skills you possess as an actor.

00:13:32.293 --> 00:13:35.150
Acting skills?

00:13:35.667 --> 00:13:37.167
Yes.

00:13:38.612 --> 00:13:42.843
Can that be done even if I'm just an empty suit?

00:13:43.414 --> 00:13:46.122
No, that's not what I meant.

00:13:47.086 --> 00:13:49.086
I'm so sorry.

00:13:50.443 --> 00:13:52.695
In any case, you will be fine.

00:13:52.695 --> 00:13:55.999
Please don't run from your destiny. Good luck at the press conference.

00:13:56.002 --> 00:13:57.764
Um, I'll go get some tea.

00:14:06.299 --> 00:14:10.028
I'm such an idiot! How could I talk to my idol like that?

00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:12.135
So hot!

00:14:16.293 --> 00:14:19.006
No matter what fate the future holds,

00:14:19.791 --> 00:14:22.817
I will walk towards the light that is you.

00:14:37.495 --> 00:14:41.179
He looks just like the spy and president from the drama "Rival."

00:14:42.848 --> 00:14:44.848
So cool.

00:14:47.295 --> 00:14:49.324
He's so handsome.

00:14:51.431 --> 00:14:54.106
-Good morning, Mr. President. -Good morning.

00:14:54.161 --> 00:14:57.597
Today's press conference will be livestreamed. Don't be nervous.

00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:01.103
You must be used to livestreams.

00:15:01.117 --> 00:15:03.129
Not at all.

00:15:03.362 --> 00:15:05.852
He stayed up all night preparing...

00:15:06.016 --> 00:15:09.125
...then had an executive meeting and a shareholder meeting this morning...

00:15:09.125 --> 00:15:10.863
...and now this press conference.

00:15:10.904 --> 00:15:14.437
Isn't Shun exhausted?

00:15:15.832 --> 00:15:18.763
Shun isn't an actor; he's the president.

00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:21.037
The president, the president.

00:15:29.336 --> 00:15:32.516
Is this suit okay?

00:15:33.166 --> 00:15:35.349
It suits you perfectly. You look wonderful.

00:15:37.617 --> 00:15:39.162
I chose it on purpose.

00:15:44.778 --> 00:15:47.405
(New President Inauguration Press Conference)
It's about time.

00:15:47.576 --> 00:15:49.170
The livestream has started.

00:15:49.231 --> 00:15:51.940
The online response is very active.

00:15:51.977 --> 00:15:53.708
There's both praise and criticism.

00:15:53.891 --> 00:15:57.639
I didn't expect us to get this much attention.

00:15:57.677 --> 00:16:00.024
He looked at the script last night...

00:16:00.024 --> 00:16:01.388
but will he be okay?

00:16:01.486 --> 00:16:04.414
The president will be fine.

00:16:18.477 --> 00:16:21.184
I am the newly appointed fifth-generation

00:16:21.228 --> 00:16:24.023
Representative Director of TAKASHIRO Corporation.

00:16:24.076 --> 00:16:26.254
My name is Shun Takashiro.

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:29.194
Our company was founded in the 26th year of the Meiji era.

00:16:29.341 --> 00:16:32.835
Successive presidents and employees have worked together as one...

00:16:32.871 --> 00:16:35.483
overcoming numerous challenges along the way.

00:16:35.898 --> 00:16:39.812
To take over as president is not only the highest honor...

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:43.842
but also fills me with a sense of trepidation.

00:16:44.799 --> 00:16:47.517
While I have no experience in the apparel industry,

00:16:47.517 --> 00:16:48.971
I will, with a fresh perspective,

00:16:49.010 --> 00:16:52.641
bring new breakthroughs to TAKASHIRO.

00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:59.439
We will now take questions.

00:16:59.457 --> 00:17:01.295
Please raise your hand if you have a question.

00:17:01.316 --> 00:17:03.171
-Looks like it will conclude smoothly. -Yeah.

00:17:03.171 --> 00:17:05.710
All that's left are the anticipated questions.

00:17:05.873 --> 00:17:07.873
Thank goodness.

00:17:08.414 --> 00:17:10.269
The gentleman over there.

00:17:13.013 --> 00:17:15.013
I'm Fujiki, a freelance journalist.

00:17:15.175 --> 00:17:19.106
Your original profession was acting. What will happen to your entertainment career?

00:17:19.141 --> 00:17:20.836
Will you be able to continue?

00:17:20.908 --> 00:17:22.908
Why would he lead with that question?

00:17:23.215 --> 00:17:26.586
Yes. Although this was sudden and unavoidable...

00:17:26.767 --> 00:17:30.724
after my current projects are completed,

00:17:30.724 --> 00:17:33.470
I will be halting my activities in entertainment to focus on my duties as president.

00:17:33.521 --> 00:17:36.066
So you'll be juggling two jobs for the time being?

00:17:36.191 --> 00:17:38.191
Can you be a proper president like that?

00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:39.875
Can you protect your employees and the stock price?

00:17:39.904 --> 00:17:41.904
Being a pretty face is useless.

00:17:46.662 --> 00:17:48.180
Please answer the question.

00:17:52.537 --> 00:17:54.537
(Who can juggle two jobs?)
(This reporter is really sharp.)

00:17:54.596 --> 00:17:56.596
(Employees' livelihoods are at stake.)
(Does he know anything about business?)

00:17:56.625 --> 00:17:58.671
(You can't run a business on acting skills.)
(He's probably just a publicity stunt.)

00:17:58.692 --> 00:18:00.840
(Wants to be an actor and a president.)
(Can't he just pick one?)

00:18:09.561 --> 00:18:13.029
I am juggling acting, and I have no experience in this industry.

00:18:13.132 --> 00:18:16.750
I certainly do not have the experience of the former president.

00:18:16.877 --> 00:18:18.877
And I do not know if I have a talent for business.

00:18:19.288 --> 00:18:20.672
However...

00:18:21.288 --> 00:18:23.829
I will not run from my destiny.

00:18:25.101 --> 00:18:28.179
For the employees, for the company...

00:18:28.414 --> 00:18:30.572
and for myself...

00:18:31.199 --> 00:18:33.356
I will give it my all.

00:18:37.743 --> 00:18:41.265
The star of my life is shining brightly today.

00:18:41.605 --> 00:18:44.859
Shun, no matter when or where...

00:18:44.868 --> 00:18:47.979
...is always the star that guides me. My Southern Cross.

00:18:54.317 --> 00:18:56.160
He even threw in a wink.

00:19:01.290 --> 00:19:03.417
Oh, he just had something in his eye.

00:19:03.633 --> 00:19:04.990
Figured as much.

00:19:06.234 --> 00:19:09.706
We will now take the next question...

00:19:22.103 --> 00:19:25.233
Stop right there!

00:19:28.631 --> 00:19:31.045
Who is that guy?

00:19:34.330 --> 00:19:36.403
Good work today, everyone.

00:19:37.163 --> 00:19:41.478
During the conference, a reporter named Fujiki deliberately tried to cause trouble for the president.

00:19:41.478 --> 00:19:44.637
We have not been able to contact him yet.

00:19:44.637 --> 00:19:48.064
From now on, everyone needs to be more cautious.

00:19:48.108 --> 00:19:49.582
Yes, ma'am...

00:19:49.699 --> 00:19:53.531
Additionally, regarding the new president's dedicated secretary...

00:19:56.149 --> 00:19:58.442
Minami will be in charge.

00:19:58.618 --> 00:20:01.102
What?

00:20:01.189 --> 00:20:04.533
You're highly capable and dislike celebrities, so you're the perfect choice.

00:20:04.562 --> 00:20:08.003
Let's all work together to support our new president.

00:20:08.062 --> 00:20:09.578
Yes, ma'am.

00:20:14.770 --> 00:20:16.786
-Um... -Please come with me.

00:20:16.814 --> 00:20:18.110
Yes.

00:20:24.851 --> 00:20:27.368
Can you be a proper president like that?

00:20:27.499 --> 00:20:29.074
Please answer the question.

00:20:32.745 --> 00:20:34.730
In any case, you will be fine.

00:20:34.774 --> 00:20:36.569
Please don't run from your destiny.

00:20:36.569 --> 00:20:38.980
I will not run from my destiny.

00:20:55.272 --> 00:20:56.861
I can't.

00:20:57.066 --> 00:20:59.917
As a fan, how can I possibly be his secretary?

00:20:59.917 --> 00:21:01.917
(Transfer Request Form)
I'll confess to the section chief tomorrow.

00:21:01.917 --> 00:21:06.860
Loving your fave means supporting them from a distance.

00:21:07.168 --> 00:21:08.743
That's the right way.

00:21:09.613 --> 00:21:11.134
(Shun Himuro has started a livestream.)

00:21:16.469 --> 00:21:21.283
I apologize for surprising everyone with the sudden announcement.

00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:24.628
I know this may be difficult for some of you to accept...

00:21:24.628 --> 00:21:26.457
but I have made my decision.

00:21:26.486 --> 00:21:30.912
As I said at the press conference, once I finish my current work...

00:21:31.083 --> 00:21:33.654
I will be going on an indefinite hiatus.

00:21:34.338 --> 00:21:37.745
There may not be a farewell event.

00:21:38.059 --> 00:21:40.537
I feel very sorry about that.

00:21:42.361 --> 00:21:44.618
My days as an actor...

00:21:45.207 --> 00:21:49.573
thanks to all of you, were an incredibly precious...

00:21:49.833 --> 00:21:51.833
and happy time for me.

00:21:53.532 --> 00:21:55.532
Thank you all so much.

00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:07.891
(Transfer Request Form)

00:22:18.169 --> 00:22:20.914
(Please make cat ears!)

00:22:20.998 --> 00:22:24.056
(Please make a heart!)

00:22:35.913 --> 00:22:37.568
Though I am unworthy...

00:22:37.613 --> 00:22:40.625
...I've decided to become your secretary.

00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:45.028
Compared to the happiness you've given me in the past...

00:22:45.075 --> 00:22:47.075
...though it cannot compare...

00:22:47.105 --> 00:22:49.942
...from now on, as the president's secretary...

00:22:49.942 --> 00:22:52.123
...I will give it my all.

00:22:52.168 --> 00:22:57.010
And of course, I will completely hide the fact that I'm a fan.

00:22:57.741 --> 00:23:00.649
Let's practice...

00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:04.289
Whoops, I almost sounded like a commoner.

00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:06.900
Mr. President.

00:23:06.967 --> 00:23:10.926
This is my battle armor for protecting my fave-turned-boss.

00:23:12.766 --> 00:23:14.743
Starting tomorrow, I'm going full throttle.

00:23:15.521 --> 00:23:16.976
Please take care of me.

00:23:21.182 --> 00:23:23.440
Minami, you're here early.

00:23:23.478 --> 00:23:24.594
Good morning.

00:23:24.757 --> 00:23:26.814
The new president is in your hands starting today.

00:23:26.814 --> 00:23:28.372
Yes, ma'am.

00:23:29.102 --> 00:23:31.594
Minami-senpai, something's happened to the president!

00:23:35.224 --> 00:23:37.224
(Is this Shun from this morning?)
(The boss of an apparel company has a very wrinkled suit.)

00:23:37.253 --> 00:23:38.210
(The suit is so dirty.)

00:23:39.310 --> 00:23:41.071
How could this happen?

00:24:40.556 --> 00:24:42.556

Stop thinking of the president as your fave!

00:24:47.208 --> 00:24:49.436
I'm trembling with excitement.

00:24:49.886 --> 00:24:51.603
You're having a hard time, too.

Suddenly becoming president of an unfamiliar industry...

00:24:54.357 --> 00:24:56.187
(Immediately Judged as a Failure?)
You're not qualified to be the president's secretary.

00:24:57.291 --> 00:24:58.485
You're not a fan, are you?

00:24:58.485 --> 00:24:59.617
I am not.
