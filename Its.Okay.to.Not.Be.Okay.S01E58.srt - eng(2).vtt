WEBVTT

00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:04.629
Who do you think will
be the first between us?

00:00:04.713 --> 00:00:07.007
You painting butterflies…

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:09.592
or me getting past my trauma?

00:00:09.676 --> 00:00:11.553
…so we can leave together.

00:00:11.636 --> 00:00:13.638
You killed an innocent person!

00:00:13.722 --> 00:00:17.392
M-Mia saw how I killed my wife.

00:00:17.475 --> 00:00:20.437
I strangled Mia because
I didn't want her to turn into a monster.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.357
There are only two people in this hospital
that could be Ingrid Hernandez.

00:00:24.441 --> 00:00:26.443
Ma'am Olivia or Ma'am Eden.

00:00:26.526 --> 00:00:28.820
Patrick, Sir Samuel is missing.

00:00:28.903 --> 00:00:31.406
Impossible. Mia is at home right now.

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:33.658
Do you know where you are?

00:00:33.742 --> 00:00:35.035
You are at my house.

00:01:31.633 --> 00:01:32.926
Mia!

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:34.260
Patrick?

00:01:37.597 --> 00:01:39.849
Patrick, I'm in here--

00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:42.268
Were you home all day?
Did you go outside?

00:01:42.352 --> 00:01:43.770
Mm-hmm.

00:01:43.853 --> 00:01:47.398
Vincent was here earlier.
We talked about the publishing--

00:01:47.482 --> 00:01:49.025
Mia, there's something
more important that happened.

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.487
Is there anything more
important than my writing career--

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.239
Sir Samuel is missing.

00:01:55.615 --> 00:01:56.950
Missing?

00:01:57.367 --> 00:01:58.535
Like gone?

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:00.745
Someone helped him
escape from the hospital.

00:02:03.414 --> 00:02:04.415
And so?

00:02:05.792 --> 00:02:07.168
What do you mean?

00:02:07.752 --> 00:02:09.129
What?

00:02:09.212 --> 00:02:11.339
You guys think I helped him escape?

00:02:12.465 --> 00:02:14.425
Why the hell would I do that?

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:18.263
I put him there so
I won't have to see him again.

00:02:21.182 --> 00:02:22.809
Is that all you wanted to say?

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.688
Can we discuss
the changes at Vincent's company now?

00:02:34.279 --> 00:02:35.405
{\an8}Patrick.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:39.701
{\an8}Patrick.

00:02:39.784 --> 00:02:42.579
{\an8}

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:50.378
{\an8}

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:57.343
{\an8}They're probably looking for you by now.

00:02:57.927 --> 00:02:59.846
{\an8}I'm just waiting for someone.

00:02:59.929 --> 00:03:01.764
{\an8}Then we'll get going.

00:03:01.848 --> 00:03:03.641
{\an8}

00:03:03.725 --> 00:03:05.935
{\an8}-
How did they get in?

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:08.730
{\an8}That person definitely
knows the ins and outs here.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.192
{\an8}- Mia was home the whole day.
So she knows?

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.111
{\an8}Yes, but you know her.

00:03:15.194 --> 00:03:16.571
{\an8}-
Where's Ma'am Eden?

00:03:16.654 --> 00:03:17.906
{\an8}Does she know of this?

00:03:18.531 --> 00:03:22.118
{\an8}She's not here yet.
Doc is also looking for her.

00:03:22.201 --> 00:03:23.494
{\an8}But did she call?

00:03:24.078 --> 00:03:25.330
{\an8}I don't know.

00:03:25.997 --> 00:03:27.248
{\an8}How about Ma'am Olivia?

00:03:27.332 --> 00:03:28.541
{\an8}She's not here.

00:03:28.625 --> 00:03:30.209
{\an8}- She's also not here?
Yes.

00:03:30.293 --> 00:03:32.545
{\an8}I can't reach them.
I called and texted them many times.

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:35.757
{\an8}

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.550
{\an8}Why are you looking for them anyway?

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:40.637
{\an8}Trust me.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.015
{\an8}I think I know who took Samuel.

00:03:46.601 --> 00:03:48.144
Patrick, come with me.

00:03:48.228 --> 00:03:51.648
I'll need a nurse aide to help get Samuel.

00:03:52.732 --> 00:03:55.652
Uh, doc. With your permission.

00:03:56.152 --> 00:03:57.362
Okay.

00:04:02.784 --> 00:04:03.952
{\an8}

00:04:04.035 --> 00:04:05.370
{\an8}

00:04:05.453 --> 00:04:08.665
{\an8}I'll take you to the farmhouse
that I bought for us.

00:04:09.832 --> 00:04:11.292
{\an8}I purchased it in installments.

00:04:11.876 --> 00:04:14.045
I knew you wanted that.

00:04:16.214 --> 00:04:20.009
You wanted to live in the countryside.
Tending to plants.

00:04:20.677 --> 00:04:23.054
Busy during the harvest season.

00:04:24.222 --> 00:04:26.641
I know you miss the life you had before.

00:04:29.018 --> 00:04:30.520
And you're right.

00:04:31.437 --> 00:04:34.816
You shouldn't die in
a place you don't like.

00:04:36.234 --> 00:04:38.194
That's why I bought the farmhouse.

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.826
I'll be the last person you'll be with

00:04:46.244 --> 00:04:47.495
while you're alive.

00:04:48.538 --> 00:04:51.958
{\an8}

00:04:53.626 --> 00:04:55.044
{\an8}I think he's here.

00:04:55.795 --> 00:04:58.298
{\an8}-

00:05:03.761 --> 00:05:05.430
{\an8}-
What are you doing here?

00:05:05.513 --> 00:05:07.056
{\an8}I know that Samuel is here.

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:08.641
I don't know what you're talking about.

00:05:08.725 --> 00:05:10.560
- Get out of here!
- Stop lying!

00:05:10.643 --> 00:05:12.687
- Patrick--
- You're trespassing!

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:15.356
- I'll file a case against you!
- I'll sue you for kidnapping!

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:16.649
This is trespassing!

00:05:33.207 --> 00:05:36.502
Send an ambulance to Ma'am Olivia's.
Sir Samuel is here.

00:05:36.878 --> 00:05:38.296
No!

00:05:38.755 --> 00:05:41.090
No! You don't know
what Samuel really wants!

00:05:41.174 --> 00:05:42.842
- Just leave!
- Olivia!

00:05:42.925 --> 00:05:45.303
You don't have
the right to do this to Samuel!

00:05:45.386 --> 00:05:46.304
You're just a nurse!

00:05:46.387 --> 00:05:48.765
I am not just a nurse!

00:05:48.848 --> 00:05:52.852
I'm the only one who truly
cares about him so just leave!

00:05:58.858 --> 00:06:00.109
Doc, we'll get going.

00:06:00.193 --> 00:06:01.694
- Take care.
- Yes, I will.

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:07.450
Is it true?

00:06:07.533 --> 00:06:08.701
It was Ma'am Olivia?

00:06:09.202 --> 00:06:10.953
Why would she take Sir Samuel?

00:06:11.037 --> 00:06:13.623
And she even had
an accomplice who was also inside.

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:16.334
Let's not worry about that for now.

00:06:16.417 --> 00:06:19.837
Pogi, call the cops.
Tell them to go to Olivia's home.

00:06:19.921 --> 00:06:21.214
Okay, doc.

00:06:21.297 --> 00:06:22.757
- Uh, doc,
- Mmm.

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:25.676
I'll prepare the things
needed for Sir Samuel's return.

00:06:26.177 --> 00:06:27.345
Sure, sure.

00:06:30.598 --> 00:06:32.558
What have you done, Olivia?

00:06:33.017 --> 00:06:34.811
How come you've gone too far?

00:06:50.785 --> 00:06:52.286
Miss Olivia Jose,

00:06:52.662 --> 00:06:56.165
did you have an accomplice help you
take Samuel Hernandez out of the hospital?

00:06:56.541 --> 00:06:58.167
Where is this person? Who is it?

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.169
It's a man.

00:07:00.586 --> 00:07:01.963
And you need to find him.

00:07:02.046 --> 00:07:04.715
So he can't take Samuel
out of the hospital again.

00:07:06.217 --> 00:07:08.094
Why did you do this, Ma'am Olivia?

00:07:10.721 --> 00:07:12.473
I can't leave you.

00:07:13.558 --> 00:07:15.351
Because your soul

00:07:15.435 --> 00:07:16.769
and my soul,

00:07:19.564 --> 00:07:22.316
are bound together, forever.

00:07:33.494 --> 00:07:34.620
Take her with you.

00:07:35.329 --> 00:07:36.581
Let's go, Ma'am.

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:45.214
Was that a poem?

00:07:45.798 --> 00:07:47.967
Does Ma'am Olivia also like poetry?

00:07:48.551 --> 00:07:50.928
- Just as Ma'am Eden does.

00:07:51.012 --> 00:07:53.097
We still haven't arrested her accomplice.

00:07:53.181 --> 00:07:56.058
But you can sue
Ms. Jose for illegal detention.

00:07:56.142 --> 00:07:57.018
No.

00:07:57.477 --> 00:07:59.061
I don't care about him.

00:07:59.437 --> 00:08:01.689
Mia, what do you mean?
You're not going to sue her?

00:08:01.772 --> 00:08:04.066
No. It's a waste of time.

00:08:04.984 --> 00:08:06.694
- You can let Olivia go.
- Mia--

00:08:06.777 --> 00:08:07.904
- Just a second.
- Yes, sir.

00:08:07.987 --> 00:08:11.491
- What happened to him is a serious matter.
- Patrick, I'm also serious.

00:08:11.949 --> 00:08:14.243
I don't care about him.

00:08:14.577 --> 00:08:16.204
And to be honest,

00:08:16.287 --> 00:08:18.080
I wish you'd have just let her have him.

00:08:18.539 --> 00:08:21.042
At least there's someone
who wants to take care of that man.

00:08:21.125 --> 00:08:23.920
Something I cannot commit to.

00:08:25.421 --> 00:08:27.256
What if she's your mom?

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:30.968
Are you seriously thinking that?

00:08:31.052 --> 00:08:32.845
Don't you think it's
odd that of all people,

00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:34.639
she wants to have Sir Samuel with her?

00:08:34.722 --> 00:08:36.807
Why is she so interested in your dad?

00:08:39.435 --> 00:08:41.103
My mom is dead.

00:08:42.605 --> 00:08:45.107
I've told you before
that I have no family.

00:08:47.276 --> 00:08:49.529
Besides, this has nothing to do with you.

00:08:49.612 --> 00:08:50.863
You shouldn't care about--

00:08:50.947 --> 00:08:53.282
I do care because
what if he hurts you again?

00:08:55.868 --> 00:08:57.328
Mia, you need to face him.

00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:59.997
So we can find out the truth.

00:09:03.125 --> 00:09:05.670
When I say my mother is dead,

00:09:05.753 --> 00:09:07.296
she's dead.

00:09:15.429 --> 00:09:17.890
It was hard when
he was gone from the hospital.

00:09:21.018 --> 00:09:22.353
Don't be stressed out.

00:09:24.146 --> 00:09:27.567
Stress can't be avoided
when you're working in a hospital.

00:09:29.402 --> 00:09:30.778
What if

00:09:30.861 --> 00:09:32.822
you leave Maravida.

00:09:34.907 --> 00:09:36.450
Why would I do that?

00:09:37.618 --> 00:09:39.620
So you won't be stressed anymore.

00:09:41.414 --> 00:09:44.542
What if you move to Manila?

00:09:44.625 --> 00:09:46.085
How about that?

00:09:47.545 --> 00:09:49.046
It's more toxic there.

00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:50.965
I'd be even more stressed out.

00:09:51.299 --> 00:09:53.217
Then don't work in a hospital.

00:09:53.301 --> 00:09:55.845
You can work in my office.
It's pretty chill there.

00:09:55.928 --> 00:09:58.848
I can make you my assistant.

00:09:58.931 --> 00:10:00.683
So you want me to take Madeth's job?

00:10:00.766 --> 00:10:03.436
Don't worry about Madeth! I'm kidding.

00:10:03.519 --> 00:10:05.146
I'd give her a different job.

00:10:05.229 --> 00:10:06.522
- Vincent.
- Oh?

00:10:06.606 --> 00:10:08.399
Why are we even talking about this?

00:10:09.483 --> 00:10:11.277
I just want to…

00:10:12.278 --> 00:10:13.404
I mean--

00:10:16.365 --> 00:10:19.118
Are you open to living in Manila?

00:10:25.333 --> 00:10:28.294
What Olivia did was so shocking!

00:10:28.878 --> 00:10:30.129
You're right.

00:10:30.671 --> 00:10:32.840
I didn't think she could do such a thing.

00:10:32.923 --> 00:10:35.509
It's a good thing you didn't promote her.

00:10:36.636 --> 00:10:39.472
Thank God Samuel's back in the hospital.

00:10:40.306 --> 00:10:43.184
So, Eden was the one
who knew where he was?

00:10:44.685 --> 00:10:46.854
You gave the promotion
to the right person.

00:10:46.937 --> 00:10:49.190
She found your patient so easily.

00:10:49.607 --> 00:10:50.941
That's the thing, Li.

00:10:51.525 --> 00:10:54.195
I think Eden found
him a little too quickly.

00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:58.991
It's like she instantly knew
that Olivia was with Samuel.

00:10:59.075 --> 00:11:00.785
How is that suspicious?

00:11:00.868 --> 00:11:03.371
Shouldn't you just be thankful?

00:11:04.372 --> 00:11:07.083
But Li, I have my doubts.

00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:12.588
I know that Olivia and Eden
are hiding things from me.

00:11:55.631 --> 00:11:57.258
She's wearing a wig.

00:11:59.718 --> 00:12:02.138
She never did that at the hospital.

00:12:02.805 --> 00:12:04.807
Is this what you meant in the book?

00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:06.934
The witch that can change her appearance.

00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:18.320
- Gemma!
- Patrick…

00:12:44.513 --> 00:12:47.183
Time of death: 9:12.

00:13:02.406 --> 00:13:03.491
Patrick…

00:13:04.867 --> 00:13:06.785
Now's the time to inform Mia.

00:13:18.214 --> 00:13:19.882
- Let go of me!
- You can't, ma'am.

00:13:19.965 --> 00:13:23.219
- Samuel! Let go of me!
- You can't come in, ma'am.

00:13:23.302 --> 00:13:24.553
- Ma'am--
- Samuel!

00:13:24.929 --> 00:13:26.680
- Samuel!
- Ma'am Olivia!

00:13:27.181 --> 00:13:29.266
Dr. Anok said you can't come here.

00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:30.935
You're no longer part
of the hospital's staff.

00:13:31.018 --> 00:13:33.646
I just want to see Samuel,
even for just a moment!

00:13:33.729 --> 00:13:37.191
Ma'am. Ma'am, don't cause a scene.
The patients might see you.

00:13:37.274 --> 00:13:38.651
I don't care!

00:13:38.734 --> 00:13:41.320
I just want to see him! Samuel!

00:13:41.403 --> 00:13:42.863
Samuel!

00:13:42.947 --> 00:13:44.657
There's nothing for you here.

00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:47.243
You can't visit him,
because he's already gone.

00:13:48.118 --> 00:13:50.120
Huh? No!

00:13:50.204 --> 00:13:51.705
That's not true.

00:13:51.789 --> 00:13:54.583
You're just saying
that to make me go away--

00:13:54.667 --> 00:13:55.751
Olivia!

00:13:55.834 --> 00:13:58.128
The doctor already
announced his time of death, Olivia.

00:13:58.212 --> 00:13:59.630
They're already prepping him.

00:14:00.422 --> 00:14:03.008
No… Samuel!

00:14:03.092 --> 00:14:05.094
- Samuel!
- This is all your fault.

00:14:06.595 --> 00:14:10.933
If you hadn't taken him,
he might still be alive.

00:14:11.767 --> 00:14:14.687
This is your fault, Olivia.

00:14:15.938 --> 00:14:18.232
Samuel died because of you.

00:14:18.315 --> 00:14:22.069
No… No!

00:14:23.028 --> 00:14:26.115
- Samuel! Samuel!
- Get her out of here.

00:14:26.198 --> 00:14:28.117
Samuel!

00:14:30.953 --> 00:14:32.288
Samuel!

00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:34.081
Patrick.

00:14:34.623 --> 00:14:36.876
Didn't I ask you to inform Mia?

00:14:39.712 --> 00:14:40.629
Yes, ma'am.

00:14:45.509 --> 00:14:48.554
What happened to Samuel was so tragic.

00:14:49.763 --> 00:14:52.600
I thought that once he got back here,

00:14:52.683 --> 00:14:55.728
he'd have a better
chance at living a long life.

00:14:57.104 --> 00:14:58.647
I thought so too, Mama Li.

00:15:01.275 --> 00:15:05.446
Is what I heard from
the security outside true?

00:15:05.946 --> 00:15:07.740
Olivia was here and made a scene?

00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:10.784
Mm-hmm.

00:15:10.868 --> 00:15:13.329
And Eden is blaming
her for Samuel's death?

00:15:15.664 --> 00:15:17.041
That seems to be the case.

00:15:19.585 --> 00:15:22.671
I guess Miss Olivia is just sad.

00:15:23.505 --> 00:15:26.800
All of the nurses here
grew fond of Mister Samuel.

00:15:31.889 --> 00:15:33.182
Patrick, we…

00:15:33.891 --> 00:15:37.311
We appreciate
you telling us before telling Mia.

00:15:38.979 --> 00:15:41.774
It's important for me
to know this before her.

00:15:43.192 --> 00:15:46.695
Vincent, I think you should
take care of Samuel's burial.

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:49.531
I'll tell Mia.

00:15:53.744 --> 00:15:55.079
This is just…

00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:58.707
This is just so heartbreaking because…

00:16:00.084 --> 00:16:02.252
Mia really is an orphan now.

00:16:11.303 --> 00:16:13.931
- Mia--
- I heard you the 1st time, Patrick

00:16:14.890 --> 00:16:16.225
Is that all?

00:16:21.188 --> 00:16:22.272
Mia…

00:16:22.356 --> 00:16:23.941
Nothing changes.

00:16:24.024 --> 00:16:25.651
I feel the same.

00:16:27.194 --> 00:16:29.613
The man that I used to call my father,

00:16:30.197 --> 00:16:31.865
is long dead to me.

00:16:34.076 --> 00:16:35.703
Don't you have any requests?

00:16:37.079 --> 00:16:40.207
Is there anything
you want for your papa's funeral?

00:16:41.291 --> 00:16:43.252
Just do what needs to be done.

00:17:23.333 --> 00:17:26.712
Do you remember
the last thing you did for me?

00:17:30.090 --> 00:17:34.595
"And the king prepared a bountiful banquet

00:17:34.678 --> 00:17:37.890
for his beloved daughter, the princess.

00:17:39.183 --> 00:17:43.645
The king invited all
the important people in the kingdom,

00:17:43.729 --> 00:17:47.232
including the princess' favorite people".

00:17:48.233 --> 00:17:49.860
So it was a huge party?

00:17:49.943 --> 00:17:52.196
The king did that for her?

00:17:52.279 --> 00:17:53.447
Of course.

00:17:53.906 --> 00:17:57.743
He prepared the best
food and the prettiest decorations

00:17:57.826 --> 00:17:59.787
for the princess' birthday.

00:18:00.871 --> 00:18:03.582
That sounds fun, right?

00:18:03.665 --> 00:18:05.876
Of course. It's super fun.

00:18:07.544 --> 00:18:09.922
Alright, I'll make you a promise.

00:18:10.339 --> 00:18:13.550
I'm going to throw
you a huge birthday party,

00:18:13.926 --> 00:18:17.054
and we'll invite all
of the people you love.

00:18:21.558 --> 00:18:25.020
"This celebration is
the most anticipated one of the year.

00:18:25.104 --> 00:18:28.565
You would see
the palace adorned with lavish décor".

00:18:56.510 --> 00:18:58.554
Is Mia really not coming?

00:19:08.105 --> 00:19:09.565
We should probably get going.

00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:01.074
Matmat.

00:20:01.617 --> 00:20:03.410
Thank you, Vincent.

00:20:03.493 --> 00:20:05.954
- Hi, Matmat.
- Mama Li.

00:20:36.818 --> 00:20:38.904
M-Mama Li…

00:20:39.738 --> 00:20:42.157
Is Mia sad?

00:20:42.783 --> 00:20:45.369
Is that what sadness looks like?

00:20:50.332 --> 00:20:52.793
Let's just leave her be for now, Matmat.

00:20:54.544 --> 00:20:57.047
Do you want to lay your flower now?

00:22:01.403 --> 00:22:03.238
Die!

00:22:05.407 --> 00:22:07.409
Just die!

00:22:07.492 --> 00:22:08.577
Mia?

00:22:09.328 --> 00:22:10.454
Mia!

00:22:11.455 --> 00:22:13.040
Mia!

00:22:15.125 --> 00:22:16.626
Mia, I'm sorry!

00:22:18.211 --> 00:22:20.172
Papa didn't mean it.

00:22:21.089 --> 00:22:22.591
I was wrong.

00:22:23.967 --> 00:22:25.510
I'm sorry, Mia.

00:22:27.012 --> 00:22:28.847
I'm sorry.

00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:32.184
Papa didn't mean to do it.

00:22:33.143 --> 00:22:34.686
It was a mistake.

00:22:35.979 --> 00:22:37.564
I'm sorry, Mia.

00:22:39.024 --> 00:22:40.859
I'm sorry.

00:24:22.669 --> 00:24:26.381
- You're going to teach again?
- I'll discuss it with Doc Anok.

00:24:27.215 --> 00:24:30.010
You're going to teach here again?

00:24:30.093 --> 00:24:34.097
You're going to teach
while writing the book, Mia?

00:24:34.181 --> 00:24:36.141
It's not yet final, Matmat.

00:24:36.224 --> 00:24:37.642
And don't worry.

00:24:37.726 --> 00:24:39.394
Our book is my priority.

00:24:39.936 --> 00:24:42.397
We're about to finish it, Mia.

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:44.733
We're about to finish it, Patpat.

00:24:45.942 --> 00:24:47.194
Matmat!

00:24:47.277 --> 00:24:49.946
You're so impressive. You finally did it!

00:24:51.948 --> 00:24:55.285
What did Matmat do, Mister Tommy?

00:24:55.368 --> 00:24:57.329
What we've talked about.

00:24:57.412 --> 00:25:00.123
You finally found the door

00:25:00.207 --> 00:25:02.417
that leads outside the box.

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:08.924
Matmat hasn't found it yet, Mister Tommy.

00:25:09.007 --> 00:25:13.261
Because Matmat hasn't drawn
the butterfly yet.

00:25:13.845 --> 00:25:15.055
Huh?

00:25:15.138 --> 00:25:16.932
It wasn't you?

00:25:17.724 --> 00:25:19.851
I thought… I thought…

00:25:45.543 --> 00:25:47.379
Your suffering has finally ended.

00:26:06.523 --> 00:26:08.733
No…

00:26:08.817 --> 00:26:12.904
Matmat didn't… draw that.

00:26:14.447 --> 00:26:16.866
That's not Matmat's drawing.

00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:20.370
The butterfly has found Matmat.

00:26:26.459 --> 00:26:29.421
The butterfly has found Matmat.

00:26:30.088 --> 00:26:31.965
- They've found me!
- Matmat.

00:26:32.048 --> 00:26:33.758
The butterfly that killed Mama!

00:26:33.842 --> 00:26:37.262
- Matmat, breathe.
- They killed Mama!

00:26:38.847 --> 00:26:40.849
- I don't like it, Patpat!
- Matmat.

00:26:40.932 --> 00:26:42.934
- They'll kill us!
- No, Matmat.

00:26:43.018 --> 00:26:45.228
- They won't.
- They'll kill us!

00:26:45.312 --> 00:26:46.646
Matmat, I'm here.

00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:49.316
- I won't leave you.
- That's what the lady…

00:26:49.399 --> 00:26:51.067
That was what the lady was wearing.

00:26:51.151 --> 00:26:53.111
We'll overcome it, right?

00:26:53.194 --> 00:26:55.488
- Matmat… Matmat.
- I don't like it, Patpat.

00:26:55.572 --> 00:26:57.365
I don't like it.

00:27:00.285 --> 00:27:02.996
Only the two of us
know about that design.

00:27:03.079 --> 00:27:04.914
And now Matmat is saying

00:27:04.998 --> 00:27:07.000
that she killed your mother?

00:27:07.083 --> 00:27:08.793
Has the butterfly arrived?

00:27:08.877 --> 00:27:10.128
You knew.

00:27:10.211 --> 00:27:11.421
Mia, it's not like that.

00:27:11.504 --> 00:27:13.423
I don't want her back to my life.

00:27:13.506 --> 00:27:15.008
Do you not like Matmat?

00:27:15.091 --> 00:27:17.469
Do you not like your big brother?

00:27:17.552 --> 00:27:18.470
Leave!

00:27:18.553 --> 00:27:19.888
If your mom is alive,

00:27:19.971 --> 00:27:21.139
the more we need to stay with you.

00:27:21.222 --> 00:27:23.475
All of us are just going to get hurt.
