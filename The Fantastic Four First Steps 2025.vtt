00:34.667 --> 00:35.875
Babe, what are you doing?

00:35.958 --> 00:37.667
I'm looking for the aloe iodine.

00:38.625 --> 00:39.625
It's not here.

00:39.708 --> 00:41.583
Yeah, because that's not where it is.

00:43.917 --> 00:46.833
Babe, can you give me 12 seconds
and I will come and get it for you?

00:46.917 --> 00:48.583
Twelve seconds is specific.

00:49.458 --> 00:51.125
Wow, these are very expired.

01:08.667 --> 01:11.083
Okay. Betadine. Chlorhexidine...

01:12.125 --> 01:13.125
No iodine.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.875
Right. Thanks.

01:29.167 --> 01:30.167
But...

01:30.958 --> 01:31.958
Well, that's not...

01:33.500 --> 01:34.750
We tried for two years.

01:34.833 --> 01:37.375
I know. I know, babe.

01:37.458 --> 01:39.375
I mean, we don't even
talk about it anymore.

01:39.458 --> 01:41.667
Talking was not the important part.

01:43.833 --> 01:46.583
It wasn't gonna be for us,
and we were okay with that.

01:46.667 --> 01:48.625
We were okay, but...

01:51.125 --> 01:52.167
Well...

01:55.292 --> 01:56.292
This is better.

01:57.292 --> 01:58.667
Yes. It's...

01:59.375 --> 02:00.667
It's a lot better, isn't it?

02:00.750 --> 02:01.750
This is great.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.708
Obviously, we're gonna need protocols
to account for our cell mutations...

02:16.792 --> 02:17.792
No, Reed.

02:17.875 --> 02:19.750
-...monitoring for further cosmic effects.
-Reed.

02:20.500 --> 02:21.625
We can do this.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.417
Okay?

02:24.500 --> 02:26.000
I really want to do this.

02:26.083 --> 02:27.583
I really want to do this.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
Then what?

02:34.833 --> 02:36.875
Nothing is going to change.

02:38.292 --> 02:39.500
Of course not.

02:41.958 --> 02:44.750
Ladies and gentlemen, we welcome you

02:44.833 --> 02:50.333
to a very special event celebrating
four years of the Fantastic Four.

02:50.417 --> 02:54.083
And now your host for the evening,
Ted Gilbert.

02:54.167 --> 02:55.875
Well, now, folks.

02:56.583 --> 02:59.042
Folks, we all know the story.

02:59.125 --> 03:03.917
Four brave astronauts head up into space,
encounter a bit of cosmic turbulence,

03:04.000 --> 03:05.500
and come back forever changed.

03:05.583 --> 03:09.792
Not just the molecules of their bodies
but also their place in our hearts.

03:10.417 --> 03:11.833
And, now, a look back.

03:11.917 --> 03:16.958
This is Excelsior Launch Control.
T-minus 3 hours, 42 minutes, 19 seconds.

03:17.042 --> 03:21.250
Four years ago, man and woman conquered
the last frontier as we know it,

03:22.042 --> 03:24.292
the exploration of space.

03:25.833 --> 03:27.625
The best pilot in the world, right here.

03:27.708 --> 03:29.583
Yeah. The best-looking he means.

03:32.667 --> 03:36.250
It was my mission, space exploration.

03:36.333 --> 03:39.000
I assembled the best scientific minds
to come along,

03:39.083 --> 03:44.792
who also happened to be my best friend,
my wife and my brother-in-law.

03:45.417 --> 03:47.417
Comms check. Everybody, sound off.

03:47.500 --> 03:49.167
-Check.
-Check, check.

03:49.250 --> 03:50.792
-Check.
-Comms are live.

03:51.417 --> 03:54.333
That last voice you just heard
was my baby brother, Jonathan Storm,

03:54.417 --> 03:56.875
and, ladies, he is very single.

03:58.750 --> 04:00.583
-Kiss for luck.
-Kiss?

04:03.167 --> 04:07.958
However, Dr. Richards's expedition
encountered an unforeseen event

04:08.042 --> 04:11.250
that changed not only the lives
of these courageous individuals...

04:11.333 --> 04:12.375
Verify go for launch.

04:12.458 --> 04:13.583
Go for launch.

04:13.667 --> 04:16.000
...but also the course of our history.

04:16.083 --> 04:18.083
-Come in, Excelsior. Come in, Excelsior.
-What is that?

04:18.166 --> 04:19.458
I don't know! I don't know!

04:20.208 --> 04:22.375
It must be the cosmic rays.

04:22.458 --> 04:25.167
-Ben! Ben!
-Ben!

04:25.792 --> 04:28.500
Obviously, while we were in space
due to errors on my part...

04:28.583 --> 04:29.750
Stop.

04:29.833 --> 04:32.083
...we encountered a cosmic storm
that altered our DNA.

04:32.167 --> 04:35.167
We came back with anomalies.

04:37.917 --> 04:40.833
And they returned with superpowers.

04:51.625 --> 04:54.042
They became our protectors.

05:02.125 --> 05:03.333
Cannonball!

05:17.542 --> 05:19.500
It's clobberin' time!

05:44.708 --> 05:48.667
I was at the opening of the Pan Am Tower
when Mole Man attacked.

05:48.750 --> 05:52.375
The Fantastic Four saved my life.

06:04.583 --> 06:06.667
Mole Man's attempt
to steal the Pan Am building

06:06.750 --> 06:09.250
was thwarted by the Fantastic Four.

06:09.333 --> 06:13.917
This is all Reed Richards's fault.
Him and his endless pursuit of progress.

06:14.750 --> 06:16.292
Power to the underground!

06:20.083 --> 06:24.083
And when the Mad Thinker
tried to sabotage New York City

06:25.292 --> 06:28.542
the Fantastic Four came to our rescue.

06:29.792 --> 06:30.792
Gotcha!

06:34.500 --> 06:35.500
Have a great day!

06:38.083 --> 06:40.917
They defeated Red Ghost
and his Super-Apes.

06:52.167 --> 06:54.542
They became our inspiration.

06:54.625 --> 06:58.458
This equation not only confirms
alternate dimensions,

06:58.542 --> 07:03.167
but it suggests parallel Earths exist
on different dimensional planes.

07:05.917 --> 07:07.417
Who wants to see a big explosion?

07:07.500 --> 07:08.750
Me!

07:10.375 --> 07:12.750
And they became our leaders.

07:12.833 --> 07:16.875
Sue Storm brokers peace deal
with Harvey "Mole Man" Elder,

07:16.958 --> 07:19.958
leader of the underground nation,
Subterranea.

07:20.042 --> 07:22.708
I don't trust surface dwellers.
I never have.

07:22.792 --> 07:25.208
But I do trust Sue.

07:25.292 --> 07:30.958
We have come together today to form
a new charter, the Future Foundation.

07:31.042 --> 07:32.625
All participating countries

07:32.708 --> 07:35.625
agree to dismantle their armed forces.

07:35.708 --> 07:39.333
And on this fourth anniversary
we celebrate them.

07:39.417 --> 07:41.542
They are the very best of us.

07:41.625 --> 07:44.167
They are the Fantastic Four.

07:44.250 --> 07:47.542
Thank you, Fantastic Four!

07:47.625 --> 07:48.958
Thank you, Fantastic Four!

07:49.042 --> 07:51.083
-Thank you, Fantastic Four!
-We love you, Fantastic Four.

07:51.167 --> 07:52.792
-I love you, Johnny!
-Fantastic Four, we love you!

07:52.875 --> 07:56.500
-Thank you, Fantastic Four.
-Thank you, Fantastic Four.

07:57.958 --> 08:02.625
We are proud to call them our guides,
our protectors and our friends.

08:02.708 --> 08:06.208
Let's hear it for Reed, Sue,
Johnny and Ben.

08:14.500 --> 08:16.375
I must say,
that was all a bit aggrandizing.

08:16.458 --> 08:17.708
-Yeah.
-H.E.R.B.I.E.

08:17.792 --> 08:20.125
-H.E.R.B.I.E. with the herbs.
-How's that sauce looking?

08:20.917 --> 08:23.042
Don't do that.
Wash your hands first, please.

08:23.125 --> 08:24.917
-I was wearing my gloves the whole time.
-Just wash your hands.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.083
Let me try that.

08:28.750 --> 08:30.000
Okay.

08:31.000 --> 08:34.082
Okay. Is this guy good?

08:34.917 --> 08:36.500
That is fantastic.

08:37.207 --> 08:38.667
-Let me try.
-It's incredible stuff.

08:38.750 --> 08:39.832
Stop. Don't do that.

08:40.582 --> 08:42.417
Don't do that. It's not quite done.

08:42.500 --> 08:43.625
No, it's not quite done.

08:43.707 --> 08:46.583
No, it could be done,
but I'm gonna add a little more garlic.

08:46.667 --> 08:47.833
Not because it's not delicious.

08:47.917 --> 08:50.167
I just want to add
a little bit of zip, okay?

08:55.542 --> 08:56.542
What are you doing?

08:57.333 --> 08:58.708
What do you mean, what am I doing?

08:58.792 --> 09:01.250
-I mean, you're gonna ruin your appetite.
-I'm hungry.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.833
They're never late for Sunday dinner.

09:06.917 --> 09:08.417
Should we wait?

09:08.500 --> 09:09.500
I guess.

09:10.500 --> 09:11.708
You're late.

09:13.958 --> 09:15.417
What do you mean?

09:15.500 --> 09:17.750
What do you mean, what do I mean?
You're late for dinner.

09:17.833 --> 09:19.542
Yes, we are. We're late for dinner.

09:19.625 --> 09:21.208
-By a single minute.
-Yes, we were just...

09:21.292 --> 09:23.958
I had to put some aloe iodine
on my shoulder and...

09:24.042 --> 09:25.417
Just had to do his shoulder and...

09:25.500 --> 09:27.292
Why is there breakfast cereal
on the dinner table?

09:27.375 --> 09:28.667
Why are you being weird?

09:29.208 --> 09:31.708
-We're not being weird.
-We're not acting weird.

09:31.792 --> 09:33.750
Well, you're doing that weird thing
with your face.

09:33.833 --> 09:35.708
Well, we don't know
what you're talking about.

09:38.625 --> 09:39.625
Are you pregnant?

09:45.333 --> 09:47.250
-Yeah, we're pregnant.
-Yes, yes.

09:47.333 --> 09:48.333
How did you know that?

09:48.417 --> 09:50.167
-Have you looked at your husband's face?
-I know.

09:50.250 --> 09:51.625
He just cannot keep a secret.

09:51.708 --> 09:53.750
-Wait, what? Really?
-Yeah.

09:56.833 --> 09:58.000
What?

09:58.083 --> 10:02.083
You are gonna be the best mom. Oh, my God.

10:02.167 --> 10:04.000
And you are gonna be the best dad.

10:04.083 --> 10:06.292
Just kidding. You are out of your depth.

10:06.375 --> 10:09.000
But we... we're gonna be
the best uncles ever.

10:10.458 --> 10:12.375
-Okay, we should eat.
-Okay.

10:13.708 --> 10:15.417
You're handling this well, you know.

10:15.500 --> 10:18.542
I figured you'd be locked in your lab
drenched in a panic sweat.

10:19.208 --> 10:20.667
I have that scheduled for later.

10:21.667 --> 10:23.458
Countdown continues

10:23.542 --> 10:27.167
as the Fantastic Four prepare to welcome
a new member to the family.

10:27.250 --> 10:32.542
Needless to say, preparations inside
the Baxter Building are well underway.

10:33.042 --> 10:35.625
All right, H.E.R.B.I.E.,
let's start the baby prep.

11:02.792 --> 11:06.292
Yancy Street bookies are putting
the odds of a girl at 4-to-5,

11:06.375 --> 11:08.292
but chances of twins are a long shot.

11:14.375 --> 11:15.375
Herbert!

11:25.833 --> 11:27.042
H.E.R.B.I.E.!

11:27.667 --> 11:30.083
The oil and gas cowboys
want a minute to yell at you

11:30.167 --> 11:31.917
before you go on maternity leave.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.417
Speaking of, coal lobby.

11:35.125 --> 11:36.458
Lynne, when you see Sue...

11:36.542 --> 11:38.625
Larry, I will tell her when I see her.

11:38.708 --> 11:39.750
Thank you, Lynne.

11:39.833 --> 11:41.875
The question on everybody's mind is,

11:41.958 --> 11:44.833
"Will the baby be born with superpowers?"

11:46.083 --> 11:47.417
H.E.R.B.I.E., we need to scan the baby.

11:47.500 --> 11:52.333
The Interna-Scan hasn't achieved the right
level of precession for clear imaging.

11:54.333 --> 11:56.125
New deep space transmission?

11:56.708 --> 11:58.917
Let's identify its origin.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.958
Shall we record and file it?

12:07.500 --> 12:10.083
2:15? What 2:15?
I don't have any meetings today.

12:11.333 --> 12:12.167
Reed.

12:12.250 --> 12:15.375
-Oh, that 2:15.
-Thank you for making the time.

12:15.458 --> 12:16.792
Johnny, do we have to today?

12:16.875 --> 12:19.000
I had some thoughts
on the new suit design.

12:19.083 --> 12:20.875
There are no new suit designs.

12:20.958 --> 12:24.375
You finished them years ago.
They have dust on them.

12:26.750 --> 12:28.667
I get it. You're gonna be a father soon.

12:28.750 --> 12:29.875
New responsibilities.

12:29.958 --> 12:32.750
-You're a bit scared.
-I'm not scared. I'm busy, Johnny.

12:32.833 --> 12:34.625
I'm busy. I'm busy.

12:34.708 --> 12:36.458
There's a difference.

12:40.750 --> 12:42.417
New transmission today.

12:43.542 --> 12:44.542
Have you listened to it yet?

12:44.625 --> 12:46.792
More of the same. It's a complex signal.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.458
Knock yourself out.

12:53.458 --> 12:55.583
Johnny, I'm running a test.

12:56.333 --> 12:57.625
Cool.

12:59.917 --> 13:01.167
I got time.

13:02.458 --> 13:04.292
Bridge teleportation test.

13:06.500 --> 13:09.583
Movement of organic matter, six meters.

13:11.542 --> 13:13.792
-Glasses.
-Thank you, Herbert.

13:14.667 --> 13:15.667
Sparky.

13:16.292 --> 13:17.500
Let's run it.

13:25.292 --> 13:26.292
It worked.

13:30.083 --> 13:31.833
-Johnny.
-Yep?

13:33.292 --> 13:34.500
Could you reset the breaker?

13:40.167 --> 13:41.167
Other way.

14:15.667 --> 14:16.667
Babe?

14:18.375 --> 14:19.875
Babe, when you're done, can you...

14:23.000 --> 14:24.167
Hello, H.E.R.B.I.E.

14:27.542 --> 14:28.583
I...

14:28.667 --> 14:30.417
I just went by the nursery.

14:32.208 --> 14:33.292
How's it looking?

14:34.417 --> 14:37.250
It's looking like
H.E.R.B.I.E.'s building the crib.

14:37.333 --> 14:39.333
Which I kinda thought was a you deal.

14:39.875 --> 14:41.125
I built this instead.

14:41.667 --> 14:44.292
Anyone can build a crib.
Only I can build this.

14:44.375 --> 14:47.667
Anyone can build a crib,
but not ours. Not for him.

14:47.750 --> 14:48.958
This is for him.

14:51.458 --> 14:54.917
Because unlike anyone else, his parents
have cosmically compromised DNA.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.000
Reed.

14:56.083 --> 14:58.500
Reed, we have done every test.

14:59.500 --> 15:01.042
Well, not this one.

15:03.417 --> 15:04.458
You wanna see?

15:06.042 --> 15:07.042
Fine.

15:08.208 --> 15:09.250
Let's see.

15:34.167 --> 15:37.042
See? There's nothing wrong with him.

15:38.292 --> 15:40.292
He's absolutely perfect.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.250
That is such a bullshit way
to win an argument.

15:51.875 --> 15:53.708
-Happy Halloween.
-Happy Halloween.

15:53.792 --> 15:54.875
Easy with the candy.

15:55.750 --> 15:56.750
-Hi, Ben.
-Hi, Heather.

15:57.625 --> 15:59.375
Hey, Ben. How's Sue doing?

15:59.458 --> 16:02.000
Yeah, she's getting close.
She was craving some Maisie's cookies.

16:02.083 --> 16:04.667
Hey! What time is it? Say the thing.

16:04.750 --> 16:06.750
That's not really something I say.

16:06.833 --> 16:09.292
It's clobberin' time!

16:09.375 --> 16:11.542
It's just in the cartoon. Sorry, sir.

16:11.625 --> 16:13.042
Oh, my God. There he is!

16:13.125 --> 16:14.542
Hey! Lift the car!

16:14.625 --> 16:15.708
-Lift it!
-You want me to lift up a car?

16:15.792 --> 16:17.792
-This car? Right here?
-Lift the car! Lift the car!

16:17.875 --> 16:19.625
You guys are gonna get me in trouble.

16:19.708 --> 16:21.167
I'll... I'll try.

16:26.833 --> 16:27.708
Can't do it.

16:27.792 --> 16:30.208
-Come on. You can do it!
-All right. I'll try one more time.

16:32.250 --> 16:36.208
Lift the car! Lift the car!
Lift the car! Lift the...

16:40.625 --> 16:42.583
Throw the car! Throw it.

16:42.667 --> 16:44.833
-Throw the car? All right.
-Yeah, throw the car.

16:48.375 --> 16:50.833
Okay, everyone. Settle down.
Back to your game.

16:52.125 --> 16:54.625
Hey, maybe throw it next time.
That'll show 'em.

16:54.708 --> 16:57.542
No, no, no. It's okay. I love kids.

16:57.625 --> 16:59.542
Spend the day with ten fourth-grade girls

16:59.625 --> 17:01.042
and you may begin to rethink that.

17:02.375 --> 17:03.917
Rachel Rozman.

17:04.666 --> 17:05.833
-I'm Ben.
-I know.

17:05.916 --> 17:07.833
You grew up near on Yancy, yeah?

17:09.541 --> 17:10.791
Right there.

17:11.291 --> 17:12.375
Very near.

17:12.458 --> 17:14.625
You know,
it feels really good being back here.

17:14.708 --> 17:17.000
I like that everything stays the same.

17:17.083 --> 17:19.666
Like Maisie's? The best.

17:19.750 --> 17:23.250
The black-and-white cookies were always
my favorite when I was a kid, but...

17:23.750 --> 17:25.000
we used to steal 'em back then.

17:27.958 --> 17:31.417
Okay. Well, maybe step inside next time.

17:31.500 --> 17:32.542
Kids would love to see ya.

17:32.625 --> 17:35.458
Yeah. Okay. I will. I'll bring cookies.

17:35.542 --> 17:37.458
Oh, yeah? Okay.

17:38.292 --> 17:40.500
Yeah, I'll bring cookies.

17:40.583 --> 17:41.917
All right.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.375
Sweet Jesus.

17:45.292 --> 17:47.375
It doesn't matter how long you beat it,

17:47.458 --> 17:49.792
you're not gonna make a meringue
if there's egg yolks.

17:49.875 --> 17:52.250
The real question is,
do you add some vinegar or not?

17:52.333 --> 17:54.708
I'm a vinegar guy. Always have been.

17:54.792 --> 17:57.208
Hey. Why the long face?

17:57.292 --> 17:58.292
What of it?

17:58.792 --> 18:01.750
Sounds like your 2:15
with Reed didn't go well.

18:01.833 --> 18:02.792
I'm sorry, pal.

18:02.875 --> 18:05.625
Hey, I'm fine, you know? I don't mind.
It's just...

18:05.708 --> 18:08.208
-I hear ya. We'll go to space again.
-Yeah, we will.

18:09.583 --> 18:10.583
Nice.

18:10.667 --> 18:12.583
I'm Johnny Storm. Flame on.

18:13.333 --> 18:15.250
Flame on. Flame on. Flame...

18:15.333 --> 18:16.542
Flame off.

18:18.542 --> 18:19.542
Down.

18:21.167 --> 18:23.292
Fantastic Kitchen, down.

18:24.708 --> 18:25.542
Whoops.

18:25.625 --> 18:27.500
-Stop it.
-I finished the crib.

18:27.583 --> 18:30.083
Included two extras. I don't know why.

18:30.167 --> 18:31.167
Thank you.

18:32.292 --> 18:33.292
-Go time.
-No, it's okay.

18:33.375 --> 18:35.042
This... This is me.

18:36.208 --> 18:37.833
For the last few months,

18:37.917 --> 18:40.708
I've been tracking a small number
of criminal organizations.

18:41.458 --> 18:43.000
A small number, huh?

18:43.083 --> 18:44.083
Forty-seven of them,

18:44.167 --> 18:46.917
including the Puppet Master in the Bowery,

18:47.000 --> 18:48.750
the Wizard in Gramercy Park

18:49.292 --> 18:50.792
and Diablo in Washington Heights.

18:50.875 --> 18:52.333
You babyproofed the world.

18:52.833 --> 18:55.375
-It's a sweet gesture.
-It's a thorough gesture.

18:55.458 --> 18:57.167
But I like punching.

18:57.250 --> 18:58.958
-You mean "clobbering"?
-No, I mean "punching."

18:59.042 --> 19:00.792
-Let's eat.
-Hey, what time is it?

19:00.875 --> 19:02.125
It's dinnertime. Get inside.

19:02.208 --> 19:04.208
-You sure it's not clobberin' time?
-Stop it.

19:14.167 --> 19:15.250
-Johnny.
-On it.

19:48.542 --> 19:49.792
What the hell?

19:54.667 --> 19:56.333
Would you look at that?

20:05.667 --> 20:08.625
Stand clear. I need everybody to
remain calm and clear the area.

20:08.708 --> 20:09.792
Stay back. Out of the way.

20:09.875 --> 20:12.042
-Get back.
-Out of the way. Get back.

20:12.125 --> 20:13.833
Breaking news from Times Square.

20:13.917 --> 20:16.542
There appears to be an object in the sky,

20:16.625 --> 20:19.000
debris raining down and some sort...

20:44.875 --> 20:47.250
Are you the protectors of this world?

20:48.708 --> 20:49.708
Yes, we are.

20:51.042 --> 20:53.542
Your planet is now marked for death.

20:55.083 --> 20:58.500
Your world will be consumed
by The Devourer.

20:59.333 --> 21:01.750
There is nothing you can do to stop him.

21:01.833 --> 21:04.667
For he is a universal force.

21:05.167 --> 21:07.292
As essential as the stars.

21:10.583 --> 21:12.458
Hold your loved ones close,

21:13.917 --> 21:17.042
and speak the words
you've been afraid to speak.

21:18.833 --> 21:23.042
Use this time to rejoice and celebrate,

21:24.417 --> 21:26.375
for your time is short.

21:29.542 --> 21:31.458
I herald his beginning.

21:31.542 --> 21:33.458
I herald your end.

21:34.875 --> 21:36.250
I herald...

21:39.125 --> 21:40.917
Galactus.

22:27.000 --> 22:30.125
Scientists around the world are trying
to verify the origin

22:30.208 --> 22:31.667
of this unknown space creature...

22:31.750 --> 22:33.000
Are you tracking her?

22:33.083 --> 22:34.750
She is too fast to track, Johnny.

22:34.833 --> 22:37.333
She is too fast,
but I'm tracking where she's been.

22:37.875 --> 22:39.708
What's a Galactus? Right?

22:39.792 --> 22:41.333
And how do you consume a whole planet?

22:41.833 --> 22:47.625
Here. DA-773, a planet
in the Proxima Delphi system.

22:47.708 --> 22:50.375
-He ate that whole planet?
-Five planets, actually.

22:50.458 --> 22:53.167
Five have disappeared, that I'm aware of.

22:53.250 --> 22:54.792
There might be more that fit the pattern.

22:54.875 --> 22:56.083
And the pattern is what?

22:56.750 --> 22:58.417
That they've been chosen with great care.

22:59.333 --> 23:00.333
Targeted.

23:01.500 --> 23:03.000
And not just disappeared.

23:03.667 --> 23:04.667
Destroyed.

23:05.750 --> 23:08.750
Wait, you're saying
these planets disappearing,

23:08.833 --> 23:10.500
that's connected to her?

23:10.583 --> 23:11.750
Yes.

23:11.833 --> 23:16.417
I've identified the herald's
energy signature and matched it to DA-773.

23:18.375 --> 23:19.625
She was there.

23:22.417 --> 23:23.542
She was at all of them.

23:24.042 --> 23:27.000
So you're saying this Galactus...

23:27.083 --> 23:29.000
Can do exactly what she says it can do.

23:31.250 --> 23:33.292
How long to get Excelsior launch-ready?

23:36.292 --> 23:38.792
Either we go up there
or Galactus comes here.

23:38.875 --> 23:40.958
I don't know, 20 hours.

23:41.042 --> 23:42.667
The launch window is in 16.

23:42.750 --> 23:45.708
-Guys... Hey, guys.
-Like I said, 16 hours.

23:45.792 --> 23:47.250
-I'll start the nav plot.
-Hey, guys...

23:47.333 --> 23:50.042
H, you wanna buzz the prep team
and I'll meet you down there?

23:50.958 --> 23:52.958
She spoke to me. The herald.
She spoke to me.

23:53.042 --> 23:56.125
She spoke to all of us, Johnny.
Galactus, devouring...

23:56.208 --> 23:59.542
Well, when I chased her,
she spoke to me in her language.

24:00.125 --> 24:01.167
What did she say?

24:01.250 --> 24:03.208
Well, it was in her own language.
I don't know.

24:03.292 --> 24:04.667
Well, what were the context clues?

24:04.750 --> 24:06.667
Context. Space.

24:06.750 --> 24:08.458
And what was the tone?

24:08.542 --> 24:09.875
Angry? Threatening?

24:09.958 --> 24:12.042
No, no, no. Not at all. It was...

24:13.333 --> 24:14.625
kind.

24:14.708 --> 24:15.667
Kind?

24:15.750 --> 24:16.833
Not kind. Warm.

24:16.917 --> 24:18.750
-Warm?
-I don't know. It was...

24:18.833 --> 24:20.667
She was, like, right here.

24:21.208 --> 24:24.625
And I was looking into her beautiful face,

24:25.208 --> 24:29.750
and I saw stars,
and I could see me in her face.

24:29.833 --> 24:32.625
She spoke to me, and it was kind of...

24:32.708 --> 24:33.542
Warm?

24:33.625 --> 24:35.500
Kind. Kind?

24:35.583 --> 24:37.500
No. No. I get it.

24:38.167 --> 24:41.250
Johnny loves space. Johnny loves women.

24:41.333 --> 24:43.542
Now there's a literal naked space woman,

24:44.375 --> 24:45.708
and Johnny thinks they had a moment.

24:45.792 --> 24:48.583
I doubt she was naked.
It was probably a stellar polymer.

24:48.667 --> 24:51.542
For the record, Ben loves
when Johnny speaks in third person.

24:52.875 --> 24:54.167
We need to get ready.

25:19.750 --> 25:24.500
Okay. So she spoke to you, yeah? And?

25:28.792 --> 25:30.208
There are 23 of these.

25:31.500 --> 25:34.708
The only repeated language
and the oldest recordings.

25:34.792 --> 25:38.208
Now, I don't know who they are
or what they're saying, but this...

25:41.083 --> 25:42.292
this is the same.

25:43.750 --> 25:44.833
This is her language.

25:47.375 --> 25:49.583
Okay. Maybe that is something.

25:52.208 --> 25:53.750
Reed wants to see you in the lab.

25:54.583 --> 25:55.958
You summoned me.

25:56.750 --> 25:58.167
I finally knocked it off the list.

25:58.250 --> 25:59.250
What?

25:59.875 --> 26:01.042
The new space suits.

26:03.625 --> 26:05.292
It's flame-retardant.

26:05.375 --> 26:07.375
Maxed out oxygen supply, but...

26:07.458 --> 26:08.917
You have to monitor the gauge.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.708
If you stay flamed on in zero atmosphere,

26:10.792 --> 26:13.208
you will burn through your air reserves
in less than ten minutes.

26:15.875 --> 26:20.083
I take back every single bad thing
I've been saying about you.

26:21.708 --> 26:22.917
To myself.

26:24.125 --> 26:25.125
In private.

26:29.083 --> 26:30.750
Four years ago,

26:31.625 --> 26:32.875
we were dreamers.

26:34.583 --> 26:37.083
Back then, the unknown meant adventure,

26:38.708 --> 26:41.375
and mystery, and discovery.

26:43.792 --> 26:47.625
With space, the greatest mystery of all.

26:47.708 --> 26:50.375
The last occasion led to the accident
that mutated them

26:50.458 --> 26:51.917
and gave them those fan...

26:59.667 --> 27:04.042
What we learned was that
the unknown also meant fear.

27:05.875 --> 27:09.375
And profound, radical change.

27:18.625 --> 27:19.917
Hiya, pal.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
Johnny showed me the new suit.

27:22.083 --> 27:25.167
It's pretty spiffy,
especially compared to the old ones.

27:25.250 --> 27:26.542
Well, the old ones...

27:28.958 --> 27:30.458
weren't adequate.

27:30.542 --> 27:31.833
Who could've known?

27:32.458 --> 27:33.542
Me.

27:34.958 --> 27:36.208
-I could've known.
-Stop.

27:37.083 --> 27:40.292
Please. You gotta stop
beating yourself up about this.

27:41.958 --> 27:43.000
You know, Stretch,

27:43.958 --> 27:45.292
I got bad news for you.

27:46.292 --> 27:47.750
You ain't that smart.

27:47.833 --> 27:49.333
Except I am that smart.

27:49.417 --> 27:51.000
Oh, yeah? Can you cook?

27:51.708 --> 27:53.625
It's more of an art, not a science.

27:53.708 --> 27:56.750
-Did you pass your driver's test?
-That was due to poorly marked signage.

28:00.375 --> 28:05.833
This Galactus, this herald,
they got no idea what they're up against.

28:07.917 --> 28:11.292
So the four of us will return to space
and face the danger waiting there,

28:13.000 --> 28:15.542
and we will find this Galactus.

28:16.125 --> 28:18.542
The second the engines fire,
everything you do from then on

28:18.625 --> 28:22.375
will be the first time a pregnant woman
has done them in the history of the world.

28:23.708 --> 28:24.708
I know.

28:27.083 --> 28:28.375
I really do.

28:30.500 --> 28:34.083
And just because I'm not talking about it
doesn't mean I'm not thinking about it.

28:36.625 --> 28:37.708
About him.

28:42.125 --> 28:44.167
I really love my new suit.

28:44.250 --> 28:46.625
It's really your old one,
it's just a lot bigger.

28:48.583 --> 28:49.667
Bluer.

28:49.750 --> 28:53.708
It is actually bluer. Just a little extra
around the sides is all.

28:53.792 --> 28:55.875
This is Excelsior Launch Control.

28:55.958 --> 28:58.917
T-minus two hours, 37 minutes, 20 seconds.

28:59.875 --> 29:04.417
Here we stand prepared
to face a danger that is unknown.

29:10.125 --> 29:12.250
A danger that has threatened our home,

29:13.792 --> 29:15.250
threatened our families

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
and threatened this planet.

29:22.875 --> 29:27.375
The unknown will become known,
and we will protect you.

29:28.417 --> 29:29.958
We will protect you.

29:46.333 --> 29:48.000
Final check and check, please.

29:48.958 --> 29:50.667
-Check.
-Check.

29:50.750 --> 29:52.208
Check.

29:52.292 --> 29:54.958
Twelve, eleven,

29:55.833 --> 30:01.375
ten, nine, eight, seven...

30:01.458 --> 30:02.875
Starting ignition sequence.

30:02.958 --> 30:07.750
...six, five, four, three...

30:07.833 --> 30:09.042
Go for launch.

30:09.125 --> 30:11.667
...two, one.

30:28.125 --> 30:30.083
The Excelsior has liftoff.

30:53.250 --> 30:57.417
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have a successful launch.

31:01.875 --> 31:05.833
And from all of us on Earth,
we wish you good luck.

31:06.500 --> 31:07.667
And Godspeed.

31:09.375 --> 31:10.500
Thank you, Earth.

31:16.667 --> 31:17.875
You seeing that?

31:21.583 --> 31:23.417
Approaching the FTL engine.

31:38.333 --> 31:39.583
Wait for my signal, Sue.

31:39.667 --> 31:40.667
Yeah.

31:40.750 --> 31:43.917
And three, two, one. Mark.

31:53.083 --> 31:57.000
And we are locked.

31:58.333 --> 32:00.625
And clear for FTL navigation.

32:00.708 --> 32:04.958
Faster-than-light in three, two, one.

32:16.792 --> 32:21.000
So the herald's energy signature tracks
to this binary system here.

32:21.500 --> 32:24.125
LHS-275, yes.

32:24.625 --> 32:27.125
Where we find her, we find Galactus.

32:27.208 --> 32:29.042
Reed, what are we up against here?

32:29.125 --> 32:32.375
-Some sort of a space dragon or something?
-Cool.

32:32.458 --> 32:34.667
We don't know.
But it's basic tactical science.

32:34.750 --> 32:36.625
Observe, assess capabilities,

32:36.708 --> 32:40.167
have H.E.R.B.I.E. collect any liquid,
gas, solid materials,

32:40.250 --> 32:41.625
analyze his physiology.

32:43.917 --> 32:47.500
Look, if he's just some big guy in a ship,
then yes, you can punch him out.

32:58.667 --> 33:00.917
Coming in on the dark side
of the system's larger planet.

33:01.000 --> 33:03.250
Copy that. I'm gonna take us out of FTL.

33:03.333 --> 33:05.250
Okay, everyone. Be prepared.

33:12.042 --> 33:13.458
So, where's this Galactus?

33:18.292 --> 33:19.500
That's strange.

33:20.292 --> 33:23.417
The herald's heat signature
is coming from inside the planet.

33:28.167 --> 33:30.083
What the hell is happening to that planet?

33:30.167 --> 33:31.625
Is there something alive down there?

33:43.042 --> 33:44.333
What is that?

33:47.083 --> 33:48.125
-Ben!
-I'm on it!

33:48.208 --> 33:50.125
Dropping us out of FTL.

33:54.625 --> 33:55.750
Watch out!

34:01.042 --> 34:02.125
Sue, hide us!

34:20.458 --> 34:23.250
It's all gone. The whole planet.

34:23.333 --> 34:25.583
And it was 13% larger than Earth.

34:31.667 --> 34:33.583
-Ben!
-It's not responding. I'm locked out.

34:35.875 --> 34:38.542
H.E.R.B.I.E.,
try to stabilize the engines.

34:40.625 --> 34:43.125
-What's going on?
-It's got us. It's pulling us in.

34:43.750 --> 34:44.875
Ben, save the engines.

34:46.042 --> 34:47.292
Save the engine!

35:21.458 --> 35:22.458
Johnny...

35:24.583 --> 35:25.958
your girlfriend's back.

35:37.542 --> 35:38.708
Hi.

35:39.333 --> 35:41.000
Galactus will see you.

35:41.500 --> 35:43.542
-I'll go.
-All of you.

35:45.667 --> 35:47.042
You should not have come.

36:27.000 --> 36:28.292
Follow.

36:29.417 --> 36:31.000
Scan everything and collect samples.

36:31.083 --> 36:32.083
Affirmative.

36:43.875 --> 36:45.333
What does Galactus want?

36:46.708 --> 36:49.417
He doesn't want. He feeds.

36:51.583 --> 36:53.958
How does he choose
which planets to consume?

36:54.500 --> 36:56.000
He does not.

36:57.833 --> 36:59.125
You choose.

37:00.542 --> 37:01.542
Yes.

37:05.333 --> 37:06.708
Johnny. What are you doing?

37:07.250 --> 37:08.625
I'm gonna charm her.

37:12.708 --> 37:13.917
So what did you say to me?

37:14.625 --> 37:16.208
When you threw me off your board?

37:17.458 --> 37:18.625
What did you say?

37:22.167 --> 37:23.708
It's a blessing.

37:24.417 --> 37:27.583
It means, "Die with yours."

37:29.208 --> 37:31.250
"Die with yours."

37:33.417 --> 37:34.583
Last question.

37:34.667 --> 37:38.208
So the surfboard, right?
Is that part of your body? Or is that...

37:46.917 --> 37:48.250
So she dumped you already?

37:48.333 --> 37:49.417
No. It went well.

38:05.208 --> 38:07.667
You stand before Galactus.

38:16.333 --> 38:19.167
The Devourer of Worlds honors you.

38:29.708 --> 38:30.917
We are honored.

38:32.625 --> 38:35.833
I was once little like you.

38:36.583 --> 38:39.083
Billions of years ago.

38:39.875 --> 38:42.417
A man from another world

38:43.333 --> 38:48.333
before this relentless, eternal hunger.

38:52.333 --> 38:54.333
You have traveled far.

38:57.000 --> 38:58.333
Yes.

39:01.042 --> 39:03.667
To beg for mercy.

39:05.625 --> 39:07.042
To talk.

39:07.958 --> 39:11.625
You carry the power to save your world.

39:11.708 --> 39:13.125
Yes. I believe we do.

39:13.958 --> 39:15.458
Inside her.

39:16.708 --> 39:18.083
The child.

39:20.708 --> 39:21.875
-What the hell?
-What...

39:22.417 --> 39:24.250
He hungers.

39:24.333 --> 39:25.750
What does that mean?

39:25.833 --> 39:28.417
I will spare your world.

39:29.292 --> 39:31.083
In exchange for the boy.

39:31.167 --> 39:33.500
What? No.

39:34.042 --> 39:36.917
He possesses the Power Cosmic,

39:37.000 --> 39:40.292
and he will inherit this cursed throne.

39:41.250 --> 39:43.917
It's not true. He's normal.

39:44.000 --> 39:47.167
We would know.
I would know. I tested the child.

39:47.250 --> 39:50.292
-He hides his nature from you.
-No.

40:01.292 --> 40:02.542
What are you doing to her?

40:03.583 --> 40:04.667
Baby's coming. The baby's coming.

40:04.750 --> 40:05.958
-Now?
-Yeah.

40:06.042 --> 40:08.000
You will not have our planet.

40:08.708 --> 40:10.583
And you will never have our son!

40:19.667 --> 40:22.333
I will eat your planet slowly

40:23.458 --> 40:26.167
while your child watches.

40:52.583 --> 40:53.708
No you don't!

41:04.333 --> 41:05.542
I'm coming, buddy!

41:07.708 --> 41:08.833
Go, go, go, go!

41:09.833 --> 41:12.417
H.E.R.B.I.E., prep all systems
for immediate launch.

41:18.542 --> 41:19.542
No!

41:28.625 --> 41:29.708
No!

41:34.125 --> 41:36.833
Surfboard, not part of the body.

41:46.417 --> 41:47.917
Come on.

42:01.292 --> 42:02.375
H.E.R.B.I.E.!

42:02.458 --> 42:03.750
Come on.

42:06.583 --> 42:07.792
Get us out of here, Ben!

42:07.875 --> 42:09.708
Hang in there, Suze, I'll get you home.

42:25.708 --> 42:26.917
Get us to the FTL!

42:28.417 --> 42:29.750
FTL in visual range.

42:31.000 --> 42:32.333
-Babe.
-I'm here, Sue. I'm here.

42:34.500 --> 42:35.958
Surfer on our six.

42:37.375 --> 42:38.292
Attach then jump.

42:38.375 --> 42:40.917
-And go where?
-Anywhere! Just jump!

42:45.042 --> 42:47.125
H.E.R.B.I.E., I'm gonna need your help
stabilizing this thing.

42:57.792 --> 42:59.500
Hold on!

43:09.750 --> 43:12.000
Ben!

43:19.958 --> 43:21.750
We lost her. All clear.

43:28.875 --> 43:30.042
She's still on us.

43:30.125 --> 43:31.125
Johnny, kill her.

43:31.667 --> 43:33.958
-Really?
-Yeah. She wants to take your nephew.

43:34.042 --> 43:36.000
-Kill her!
-All right. All right.

43:38.167 --> 43:41.750
Just when I finally met
someone interesting.

43:51.208 --> 43:52.833
It's bending the beam!

43:52.917 --> 43:55.250
The wormhole is bending the beam!

44:00.708 --> 44:03.000
Reed, I can't get a lock on her!

44:03.083 --> 44:04.667
All right. Figure it out. Come on.

44:04.750 --> 44:05.958
Reed, what's the plan?

44:14.792 --> 44:16.375
Johnny, quit screwing around.

44:16.458 --> 44:19.542
Do I tell you how to drive the ship?
Don't tell me how to kill sexy aliens!

44:19.625 --> 44:21.042
Stop calling her sexy.

44:26.333 --> 44:27.750
Yes! Yes!

44:27.833 --> 44:29.125
-Yes!
-Yes!

44:34.875 --> 44:35.833
She's back!

44:35.917 --> 44:37.875
-Reed, I can't shake her.
-Working on it!

44:39.542 --> 44:41.458
-She's slippery!
-Reed!

44:45.458 --> 44:47.125
Drop us out of FTL here.

44:47.792 --> 44:49.500
That's a pretty big neutron star.

44:49.583 --> 44:51.750
I know. We're gonna use it.

44:51.833 --> 44:54.792
Isn't that basically a black hole?
Won't that kill us?

44:54.875 --> 44:56.000
Taking us out.

45:15.625 --> 45:16.708
What's the plan?

45:16.792 --> 45:19.875
Draw her close enough to the star,
she'll get stuck in the gravity well.

45:19.958 --> 45:21.417
There'll be a time dilation.

45:21.500 --> 45:24.083
-How much of a dilation?
-Is it more than mine?

45:24.167 --> 45:25.917
It'll take her a month to break free.

45:27.167 --> 45:28.333
Take us in, Ben.

45:28.417 --> 45:30.083
Reed, we could get sucked in.

45:30.708 --> 45:31.833
Ben, trust me.

45:32.500 --> 45:33.750
Hang on.

45:47.958 --> 45:49.042
Come on.

45:49.125 --> 45:50.042
It's chewing us up!

45:51.292 --> 45:52.375
Get closer.

45:52.458 --> 45:53.708
It's chewing us up!

45:53.792 --> 45:55.417
A little closer!

45:56.250 --> 45:57.625
Come on, Reed. What are we doing?

45:57.708 --> 46:01.333
Sue, we need 30 seconds of invisibility.
Can you do it?

46:01.875 --> 46:03.167
After your next contraction.

46:51.542 --> 46:53.125
-Yes!
-Hell, yeah!

46:53.208 --> 46:54.792
You all right, Sue?

46:57.667 --> 46:59.125
We need to strap you down.

46:59.208 --> 47:01.625
-Strapping her down.
-Do not strap me down!

47:02.625 --> 47:04.167
Not strapping her down.

47:05.500 --> 47:07.583
Baby, you need gravity to push.

47:08.250 --> 47:10.208
This is not right.
It's not how it's supposed to be.

47:10.292 --> 47:11.375
I know, I know.

47:11.458 --> 47:13.083
But we're gonna make it work.

47:14.583 --> 47:16.125
You're doing wonderful, my love.

47:19.500 --> 47:21.500
We don't have enough juice to get home.

47:21.583 --> 47:22.917
Oh, no.

47:26.667 --> 47:27.708
No, we do not.

47:27.792 --> 47:31.208
I can slingshot around the star,
draft off its orbital momentum.

47:31.292 --> 47:33.708
We need to get to .88 speed of light.

47:33.792 --> 47:35.417
Reed!

47:35.500 --> 47:37.125
-Johnny, the velocity gauge.
-Reed!

47:37.208 --> 47:38.208
On it.

47:39.750 --> 47:40.917
-I'm here.
-Don't go. Don't go.

47:41.000 --> 47:42.542
I'm not going anywhere.

47:42.625 --> 47:44.250
I'm right here.

47:44.333 --> 47:46.333
Beginning slingshot. Here we go.

47:49.208 --> 47:50.583
Coming up on .82.

47:50.667 --> 47:51.792
On your mark, Johnny.

47:53.583 --> 47:56.167
Why... Why do they wanna take him?
Something is wrong with him.

47:56.250 --> 47:57.708
-There's nothing wrong with him.
-You don't know that.

47:57.792 --> 47:58.917
-I do. I do know.
-No, you don't.

47:59.000 --> 48:00.542
You know everything,
but you don't know that.

48:00.625 --> 48:02.542
-What if he's a monster?
-He's not a monster.

48:03.375 --> 48:05.417
-Everything's gonna change.
-Nothing is gonna change.

48:05.500 --> 48:07.125
-Everything's gonna change.
-I promise you.

48:07.208 --> 48:08.875
-I promise.
-You can't promise that.

48:08.958 --> 48:10.417
-I promise.
-You can't promise that.

48:10.500 --> 48:11.833
-Reed...
-Okay.

48:16.250 --> 48:18.042
He's coming. He's coming.

48:18.125 --> 48:19.208
Give me your hand.

48:19.292 --> 48:20.417
.84. Ben!

48:20.500 --> 48:21.833
Come on!

48:24.500 --> 48:26.083
-Sue. Push.
-No.

48:26.167 --> 48:27.750
-Yes, you can.
-.85.

48:27.833 --> 48:28.917
-Ready?
-Okay.

48:29.000 --> 48:31.542
One, two, three, push!

48:35.917 --> 48:37.500
-Come on!
-.86!

48:37.583 --> 48:39.833
Push. Push. That's good.

48:41.333 --> 48:42.375
.87.

48:45.958 --> 48:47.458
-Mark!
-Ben!

48:47.542 --> 48:48.708
H.E.R.B.I.E.

48:50.750 --> 48:51.792
Ben, help!

48:52.833 --> 48:54.250
Thrusters engaged.

48:55.750 --> 48:57.167
H.E.R.B.I.E., get ready!

49:03.250 --> 49:04.625
Hold on, everyone.

49:30.667 --> 49:32.208
I got you, little guy.

50:02.958 --> 50:04.125
Franklin.

51:05.375 --> 51:09.792
After a monthlong return trip,
the Fantastic Four are finally home

51:09.875 --> 51:11.458
and receiving a warm welcome.

51:21.833 --> 51:23.042
Her baby!

51:24.417 --> 51:26.708
Oh, my God. Unbelievable.

51:26.792 --> 51:29.125
-Lynne, we're going to need--
-Come this way.

51:32.625 --> 51:33.750
Reed! Reed!

51:33.833 --> 51:35.750
-Move back!
-Dr. Richards, over here!

51:35.833 --> 51:38.750
-Can we get a word?
-Stand back. Make a path.

51:38.833 --> 51:41.458
Sue! Sue!

51:45.917 --> 51:48.917
They're ready for you. Step up.
Just keep it brief.

51:53.708 --> 51:55.833
I'm sorry.
We don't have a prepared statement.

51:58.917 --> 52:01.083
One at a time, please. One at a time.

52:01.167 --> 52:02.208
Connor.

52:02.750 --> 52:05.958
Welcome back. Could you take us through
how you defeated Galactus?

52:07.667 --> 52:08.667
How we de...

52:12.083 --> 52:13.167
We didn't.

52:13.250 --> 52:15.625
Not yet. Not yet, we didn't.

52:15.708 --> 52:17.167
What does that mean?

52:17.250 --> 52:18.542
Follow up.

52:20.125 --> 52:21.500
What do you mean, you didn't?

52:23.542 --> 52:26.708
We attempted to negotiate, but Galactus...

52:30.250 --> 52:32.667
He asked too high a price.

52:32.750 --> 52:35.000
-Well, what does he want?
-What did he ask?

52:39.042 --> 52:40.583
He asked for our child.

52:43.083 --> 52:45.625
He said, "Give us your child,

52:47.667 --> 52:48.875
and I will spare the earth."

52:50.167 --> 52:52.500
We said no, obviously. We said no.

52:53.333 --> 52:55.333
We're gonna... We're gonna circle back

52:55.417 --> 52:56.750
with a more detailed statement...

52:56.833 --> 52:58.542
-You said no?
-What does that mean for us?

52:58.625 --> 53:00.542
Could giving Galactus the child save us?

53:02.292 --> 53:03.750
Hang on-- You can't just...

53:03.833 --> 53:05.833
Just answer this. Answer this.

53:06.667 --> 53:08.375
Are we safe?

53:09.417 --> 53:10.958
-Are we safe?
-Yeah.

53:14.833 --> 53:15.917
I don't know.

53:16.833 --> 53:19.292
-What do you mean, you don't know?
-You don't know?

53:20.625 --> 53:23.917
What do you mean, you don't know?
What do you mean, you don't know?

53:39.333 --> 53:40.333
I'm sorry.

53:41.375 --> 53:42.750
I've failed you.

53:43.500 --> 53:46.167
I need the child.

53:46.250 --> 53:48.875
I must get the child.

53:50.292 --> 53:51.917
But he's just a baby.

53:57.958 --> 54:01.542
He is a being of infinite power,

54:02.333 --> 54:06.208
one strong enough to absorb my hunger,

54:07.375 --> 54:11.625
so that I may finally rest.

54:12.333 --> 54:14.708
-How much time do we even have?
-And what do we do when he gets here?

54:14.792 --> 54:16.833
What about the ship?
We blast it. Problem solved.

54:16.917 --> 54:19.417
You can't blast it.
Conventional weapons won't work.

54:19.500 --> 54:20.958
-So, we run.
-We run?

54:21.042 --> 54:23.000
Draw him away from Earth.
We're faster than him, right?

54:23.083 --> 54:25.042
-Not faster than the herald.
-Well, we got a head start.

54:25.125 --> 54:28.000
Yeah, but that's all we've got, and then
he could still eat the Earth anyways.

54:28.875 --> 54:30.083
Reed.

54:30.625 --> 54:32.333
You want to take us through what you have?

54:33.000 --> 54:35.083
-What I have?
-Yeah.

54:36.083 --> 54:37.583
What I have is nothing.

54:37.667 --> 54:39.375
Nothing. Did you say nothing?

54:39.458 --> 54:42.250
I analyzed the samples H.E.R.B.I.E. took
from Galactus's ship.

54:42.958 --> 54:46.542
All evidence suggests
he predates our universe, our reality.

54:46.625 --> 54:49.750
It could take ten years to understand
his composition, let alone his existence.

54:49.833 --> 54:51.083
You're talking about a god?

54:51.167 --> 54:53.708
I'm talking about something
beyond our experience.

54:54.208 --> 54:55.792
An unknowable life...

54:55.875 --> 54:57.958
who imagines Franklin as his successor,

54:58.042 --> 55:00.542
and possessing some kind of cosmic power.

55:00.625 --> 55:02.625
That can't be true.
You ran all those tests. Right?

55:02.708 --> 55:04.958
I have, but I don't know
what can or cannot be.

55:05.042 --> 55:07.167
I'm not sure how long.
I'm not sure of anything. I...

55:07.667 --> 55:08.750
I have nothing. I...

55:09.375 --> 55:10.625
I have nothing.

55:12.292 --> 55:14.542
If we could solve something,

55:14.625 --> 55:17.958
any link in the chain...

55:19.042 --> 55:22.250
E is the effort force, R is the lever arm
connected to the effort.

55:22.333 --> 55:24.750
L is the load, r is the lever arm
connected to the load.

55:24.833 --> 55:26.917
Archimedes. The Law of Levers.

55:27.000 --> 55:30.250
"Give me a lever and a place to stand
and I will move the earth."

55:31.583 --> 55:32.583
We need a lever.

55:32.667 --> 55:34.167
You wanna translate that?

55:34.250 --> 55:36.917
Yeah, we solve the right small problem,
we solve the big Galactus one.

55:37.000 --> 55:38.750
Yes. Yes.

55:38.833 --> 55:40.583
All right, boys, let's go look for levers.

55:40.667 --> 55:41.667
Yep.

55:44.833 --> 55:47.042
You know, you're supposed to sleep
when the baby sleeps.

55:47.542 --> 55:50.292
I've been, you know, reading the books.

55:51.542 --> 55:53.833
He thinks the baby actually sleeps.

55:56.667 --> 55:57.875
It's a blessing.

56:01.625 --> 56:02.625
It's a blessing.

56:06.042 --> 56:07.542
I gotta show you something.

56:07.625 --> 56:08.708
What do you wanna show me?

56:08.792 --> 56:10.583
-It's really good.
-I barely slept last night.

56:10.667 --> 56:11.708
I'm sorry to hear that.

56:11.792 --> 56:14.208
It's not like you chose this whole thing.
Being a mother, you know?

56:14.292 --> 56:16.750
Sit down. Good. I gotta show you.
Just trust me.

56:17.333 --> 56:18.833
Okay. All right.

56:18.917 --> 56:20.583
Johnny, it smells.

56:20.667 --> 56:22.500
It's pheromones. Relax. All right.

56:23.208 --> 56:24.667
Racking back the helmet cam.

56:31.042 --> 56:32.125
It's a blessing.

56:32.958 --> 56:35.458
It means, "Die with yours."

56:40.458 --> 56:42.917
I told you I'd heard that before.

56:44.458 --> 56:46.958
Now we have a sentence translated,

56:47.042 --> 56:49.625
and we can use that to figure out
what all of this means.

56:49.708 --> 56:51.167
I mean, Reed could build an algorithm,
and then...

56:51.250 --> 56:52.417
His big brain is busy.

56:52.500 --> 56:53.792
I'm all over this.

56:53.875 --> 56:58.125
A Rosetta stone to find him
an Archimedes lever.

56:58.792 --> 56:59.917
See?

57:00.000 --> 57:01.625
I can reference old stuff too.

57:09.458 --> 57:10.875
There you go. Good boy.

57:29.750 --> 57:33.292
Fantastic Four has verified
that an unknown spacecraft

57:33.375 --> 57:36.708
believed to be Galactus
has just passed Jupiter.

57:36.792 --> 57:41.333
Financial institutions remain closed
as angry protestors take to...

57:41.417 --> 57:45.375
The newly formed Galactus cult intends
to summit Mount Ev--

57:45.917 --> 57:49.125
Tempers boiled over
in Central London today,

57:49.208 --> 57:52.792
breaking out in violence,
as the whole world wonders,

57:53.292 --> 57:55.417
"What is to be our fate?"

57:57.750 --> 57:59.208
Hey, what about us?

58:00.500 --> 58:02.042
We got families too.

58:03.125 --> 58:05.500
Guys, it's getting bad out there.

58:06.042 --> 58:09.208
It seems to me
they have no plan for Galactus.

58:09.292 --> 58:11.792
We, as a society,
have to reckon with the idea

58:11.875 --> 58:14.667
that the Fantastic Four
could save us today,

58:14.750 --> 58:16.750
-but they choose not to?
-No.

58:16.833 --> 58:18.833
The idea is simple.

58:18.917 --> 58:23.375
Reed Richards and Sue Storm hand over
their baby and we all live.

58:23.458 --> 58:24.375
One life...

58:32.500 --> 58:33.792
Where are you?

58:34.792 --> 58:37.042
Get down from your high tower.

58:39.417 --> 58:41.792
You're supposed to protect us!

58:41.875 --> 58:43.292
Give up the baby!

58:46.292 --> 58:48.750
-They're scared.
-Who isn't scared?

58:48.833 --> 58:51.583
That is scary.

58:51.667 --> 58:54.042
Why? They can't hurt us.

58:54.125 --> 58:55.958
Well, it's scary because they hate us.

58:56.042 --> 58:59.458
They think they might die, and they
hate us for it. And they hate Franklin.

59:01.083 --> 59:04.042
And they may be right because right now,
we don't have a workable plan.

59:04.125 --> 59:05.625
The clock is ticking.

59:05.708 --> 59:06.875
So their plan looks good.

59:06.958 --> 59:12.250
It's mathematical, it's ethical,
and it's available.

59:13.667 --> 59:14.958
What are you saying?

59:15.792 --> 59:19.833
I'm not saying anything.

59:32.958 --> 59:35.917
Oh, sweetheart. It's all right, buddy.

59:41.958 --> 59:45.958
You know Ben's wrong.
There's always people that can hurt you.

59:47.208 --> 59:49.292
Sue, please hear me.

59:50.250 --> 59:52.833
I would never give him up to Galactus.
I would never do that.

59:52.917 --> 59:57.333
"Mathematical? Ethical? Available?"
It was just so easy for you to say that.

59:57.417 --> 59:58.417
It means nothing.

59:58.500 --> 01:00:00.375
It means I know you,
I know how your brain works.

01:00:00.458 --> 01:00:02.083
It means you've thought about it.

01:00:02.167 --> 01:00:04.792
Means you've rolled it around in your head
and you've worked the problem.

01:00:04.875 --> 01:00:06.042
Which means nothing.

01:00:07.083 --> 01:00:10.208
It is my job to think terrible things
so that terrible things don't happen.

01:00:10.292 --> 01:00:13.042
It's not your job, Reed. That's you.

01:00:13.833 --> 01:00:16.333
Okay. You're right, it is me.

01:00:18.208 --> 01:00:24.833
I don't dream, I don't wonder, I invite
the worst possible thing into my head

01:00:24.917 --> 01:00:28.333
to figure out how to hurt them
before they hurt anybody else.

01:00:28.417 --> 01:00:32.792
And you know what? Sometimes…
sometimes you being you hurts me.

01:00:36.750 --> 01:00:37.875
Well, I don't mean to.

01:00:43.417 --> 01:00:44.792
I know. I know.

01:00:47.458 --> 01:00:48.833
I know.

01:00:50.375 --> 01:00:53.083
Listen, I am going to solve this.
I'm gonna make it right.

01:01:03.333 --> 01:01:07.083
We don't know what he is
or what he might become…

01:01:09.333 --> 01:01:11.833
but I am not giving him up.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:35.417
You're selfish.

01:01:43.167 --> 01:01:44.750
How can you bring him out here?

01:01:46.417 --> 01:01:48.208
I wanted to introduce you to someone.

01:01:50.167 --> 01:01:52.750
This is our son, Franklin.

01:01:53.750 --> 01:01:55.542
There's been a lot of talk about him.

01:02:01.375 --> 01:02:04.667
Most of you know me. You know my story.

01:02:04.750 --> 01:02:07.708
When Johnny and I were kids,
our parents were in a car crash.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.792
Our dad was driving and he lived,

01:02:12.708 --> 01:02:14.333
but our mom didn't.

01:02:14.875 --> 01:02:18.250
I know what it's like to be part
of a family that was torn apart.

01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:22.500
Our dad, he wasn't always a great father,
but he wanted to be.

01:02:22.583 --> 01:02:23.750
He did his best.

01:02:23.833 --> 01:02:27.250
He wanted us to be together
because that's what family is.

01:02:28.167 --> 01:02:31.000
It's about fighting for something
bigger than yourself.

01:02:31.708 --> 01:02:34.458
It's about connecting to something
bigger than yourself.

01:02:53.875 --> 01:02:56.542
It's about having something
bigger than yourself.

01:02:57.500 --> 01:03:01.625
And the four of us... the four of us
already do because we have you.

01:03:05.042 --> 01:03:06.667
You know, our mom always used to say,

01:03:06.750 --> 01:03:10.208
"Suzie, for you,
I would move heaven and earth."

01:03:12.167 --> 01:03:14.083
And we would do that for you.

01:03:18.542 --> 01:03:22.208
I will not sacrifice my child
for this world.

01:03:24.667 --> 01:03:28.458
But I will not sacrifice this world
for my child.

01:03:32.042 --> 01:03:33.625
We will face this together.

01:03:34.625 --> 01:03:36.375
We will fight this together.

01:03:36.875 --> 01:03:39.500
And we will defeat this together.

01:03:39.583 --> 01:03:40.708
As a family.

01:03:47.208 --> 01:03:49.083
"As a family."

01:03:52.083 --> 01:03:53.250
Archimedes.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:56.083
The Law of Levers.

01:03:56.167 --> 01:03:58.833
"Give me a lever and a place to stand
and I will move the earth."

01:03:58.917 --> 01:04:01.417
We are going to move heaven and earth.

01:04:03.125 --> 01:04:04.417
Well, just earth.

01:04:05.125 --> 01:04:06.125
Sue?

01:04:07.875 --> 01:04:08.875
You solved it.

01:04:08.958 --> 01:04:09.958
I did?

01:04:10.042 --> 01:04:12.542
Yes. We are going to move Earth

01:04:12.625 --> 01:04:15.292
to a place that Galactus
will never find us.

01:04:16.083 --> 01:04:16.958
How?

01:04:17.500 --> 01:04:19.333
Well, we already have the lever.

01:04:19.833 --> 01:04:21.000
The bridge.

01:04:21.083 --> 01:04:22.667
The bridge is a prototype.

01:04:22.750 --> 01:04:24.417
You moved an egg across the room.

01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:25.958
You think you can do that with a planet?

01:04:26.042 --> 01:04:27.250
We are out of options.

01:04:27.333 --> 01:04:30.417
We have to make it work.
We will make it work.

01:04:31.875 --> 01:04:33.208
Heaven and earth.

01:04:39.125 --> 01:04:41.542
We interrupt this program
with a special report.

01:04:41.625 --> 01:04:43.542
And now an announcement
from Reed Richards.

01:04:43.625 --> 01:04:47.417
As you're about to see,
we've solved the physics of teleportation.

01:04:53.292 --> 01:04:54.375
H.E.R.B.I.E.

01:04:56.750 --> 01:04:59.167
The difference between a planet
and an egg is only scale.

01:05:00.917 --> 01:05:02.292
Starting immediately,

01:05:02.375 --> 01:05:05.250
we will create teleportation bridges
spanning the globe.

01:05:05.333 --> 01:05:07.833
They will be synchronized
and interconnected,

01:05:07.917 --> 01:05:09.583
capable of transporting our planet

01:05:09.667 --> 01:05:13.458
to a new solar system within a 2% margin
of the inhabitable zone.

01:05:14.167 --> 01:05:16.792
But more importantly, away from Galactus,

01:05:16.875 --> 01:05:19.417
where he won't be able to find us
for millions of years.

01:05:19.500 --> 01:05:21.292
Time is not on our side.

01:05:21.375 --> 01:05:23.500
I'm reaching out to the world
with a list of materials

01:05:23.583 --> 01:05:24.667
that we need in bulk.

01:05:25.250 --> 01:05:27.292
Plutonium-239.

01:05:29.583 --> 01:05:30.750
All right, people.

01:05:30.833 --> 01:05:32.208
Like my old man used to say,

01:05:32.292 --> 01:05:34.958
"If you don't know what to do,
pick up a shovel."

01:05:35.042 --> 01:05:37.375
Fire it up.
We got bridges to build. Let's go.

01:05:42.583 --> 01:05:46.250
The last 36 hours has seen
an historical mobilization

01:05:46.333 --> 01:05:48.375
of every country working together,

01:05:48.458 --> 01:05:51.458
in a way the world has never seen before.

01:05:55.958 --> 01:05:59.208
With Galactus's ship
deep within our solar system

01:05:59.292 --> 01:06:01.875
and the Fantastic Four's
Hail Mary in the balance,

01:06:02.583 --> 01:06:05.083
we are calling on every helping hand.

01:06:05.167 --> 01:06:08.542
If you can do something well,
now you can do it for your planet.

01:06:16.333 --> 01:06:20.292
We are getting reports
that Galactus has passed Mars.

01:06:22.708 --> 01:06:23.875
H.E.R.B.I.E., record.

01:06:32.458 --> 01:06:33.750
It takes too much power.

01:06:35.083 --> 01:06:37.542
I only got this to work
by tripling my intake,

01:06:37.625 --> 01:06:39.542
which drained the New York City grid
in two seconds.

01:06:39.625 --> 01:06:41.833
To do this, there isn't enough
power in the world.

01:06:41.917 --> 01:06:44.167
I'd have to turn off
every light switch on the planet.

01:06:45.708 --> 01:06:46.708
For how long?

01:06:47.917 --> 01:06:50.167
Factoring in
we gotta keep building bridges,

01:06:50.250 --> 01:06:53.167
how long would we need to conserve power?

01:06:54.792 --> 01:06:56.208
Sacrifices will be made.

01:06:57.167 --> 01:07:00.042
We all need to conserve power
at a scale never attempted before.

01:07:01.292 --> 01:07:02.500
Quite right, H.E.R.B.I.E.

01:07:03.250 --> 01:07:04.792
All the power.

01:07:05.500 --> 01:07:07.792
The worldwide energy curfew only works

01:07:07.875 --> 01:07:10.250
if everybody does their part
to conserve electricity.

01:07:16.333 --> 01:07:17.542
Missed a spot.

01:07:17.625 --> 01:07:21.917
Yeah. Curfew fried it.
Now I look like an idiot.

01:07:24.208 --> 01:07:25.417
Beard could be cool.

01:07:26.958 --> 01:07:28.000
Seriously?

01:07:29.542 --> 01:07:31.417
I built this to see what you looked like.

01:07:32.667 --> 01:07:33.667
You see,

01:07:34.458 --> 01:07:37.708
most fathers want their sons
to look exactly like them,

01:07:38.667 --> 01:07:39.875
inside and out.

01:07:40.875 --> 01:07:41.917
But...

01:07:43.417 --> 01:07:44.917
I don't want you to be like me.

01:07:48.375 --> 01:07:50.750
There's something wrong with me,
always has been.

01:07:55.417 --> 01:07:56.875
The more I look at you,

01:07:58.750 --> 01:08:00.042
the less I know.

01:08:01.333 --> 01:08:03.500
And the less I know, the more scared I am.

01:08:05.875 --> 01:08:09.083
So you know what?
I'm not gonna look anymore.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.375
I'm gonna let you tell me who you are.

01:08:14.458 --> 01:08:17.292
And if you'd like to tell me now,
that would be helpful,

01:08:17.375 --> 01:08:20.292
especially if you're
an all-powerful space god.

01:08:20.375 --> 01:08:23.500
I'd like to know that sooner
rather than later, if you don't mind.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:29.000
Oh, no.

01:08:30.125 --> 01:08:31.207
You're busy peeing.

01:08:32.667 --> 01:08:33.957
You're a very good boy.

01:08:43.542 --> 01:08:44.750
Thanks, buddy.

01:08:51.250 --> 01:08:53.167
This is going to work.

01:08:54.957 --> 01:08:56.042
It has to.

01:09:28.667 --> 01:09:30.957
Yes! Yes!

01:09:33.832 --> 01:09:35.582
Yep, coming. Coming, coming, coming.

01:09:36.917 --> 01:09:40.082
Guys, I am onto something.

01:09:40.167 --> 01:09:41.625
Moving a planet here, Johnny.

01:09:41.707 --> 01:09:44.792
Yeah, Johnny. It's four. Fantastic Four.

01:09:44.875 --> 01:09:46.082
Let's move a planet.

01:09:46.167 --> 01:09:48.457
-Cool beard.
-You mean that? Thank you.

01:09:49.667 --> 01:09:50.750
Copy, Delhi.

01:09:52.250 --> 01:09:54.292
Let's do this. London, stand by.

01:09:54.375 --> 01:09:55.542
Yes, copy, London.

01:09:57.083 --> 01:09:58.167
Copy, Paris.

01:09:58.250 --> 01:10:00.833
-Lima, do you copy?
-Copy, Rome.

01:10:00.917 --> 01:10:03.167
-Copy, Delhi.
-Copy, Vienna.

01:10:03.250 --> 01:10:04.542
Copy, Prague.

01:10:04.625 --> 01:10:07.333
-Chicago, stand by.
-Copy, Chicago.

01:10:08.625 --> 01:10:10.000
Earth go for countdown.

01:10:10.958 --> 01:10:12.250
Here we go, folks.

01:10:13.333 --> 01:10:14.333
Go.

01:10:14.417 --> 01:10:17.375
20, 19…

01:10:18.042 --> 01:10:22.083
18, 17, 16…

01:10:23.042 --> 01:10:27.625
15, 14, 13…

01:10:28.458 --> 01:10:30.083
12...

01:10:30.167 --> 01:10:31.167
11…

01:10:31.917 --> 01:10:35.833
10, 9, 8…

01:10:35.917 --> 01:10:38.458
7, 6…

01:10:39.875 --> 01:10:41.583
-What is that?
-What's happening?

01:11:07.750 --> 01:11:10.333
-She's going for this bridge.
-No.

01:11:11.292 --> 01:11:12.583
She's coming for Franklin.

01:11:14.417 --> 01:11:16.500
-Oh, my God.
-Lock the building down!

01:11:19.167 --> 01:11:21.083
Wait. Where's Johnny?

01:11:51.667 --> 01:11:53.458
-Shalla-Bal.
-Shalla-Bal.

01:11:53.542 --> 01:11:54.542
Shalla-Bal!

01:12:11.333 --> 01:12:13.250
You understand these messages…

01:12:14.625 --> 01:12:16.542
You know my language?

01:12:17.333 --> 01:12:19.375
I've learned about you.

01:12:21.417 --> 01:12:22.333
Shalla-Bal.

01:12:24.500 --> 01:12:26.667
How do you know that name?

01:12:26.750 --> 01:12:28.750
And how did you get these?

01:12:29.875 --> 01:12:31.917
Die with yours.

01:12:32.417 --> 01:12:35.292
How? He barely has a grasp
of the English language.

01:12:35.375 --> 01:12:37.708
Twenty-three transmissions,

01:12:37.792 --> 01:12:39.333
all in your language,

01:12:40.125 --> 01:12:42.792
trace back to the planet Zenn-La.

01:12:44.917 --> 01:12:45.917
Your home.

01:12:48.125 --> 01:12:50.625
They were looking for you, to thank you.

01:12:52.167 --> 01:12:54.708
Once I translated one phrase,

01:12:54.792 --> 01:12:59.292
I pieced together enough language
to understand a part of your history.

01:13:00.333 --> 01:13:04.292
You were some sort of scientist
or astronomer.

01:13:05.708 --> 01:13:08.625
When Galactus came,
you offered to serve as his scout

01:13:08.708 --> 01:13:10.083
if he'd spare your planet.

01:13:11.042 --> 01:13:12.792
Was it to spare your family?

01:13:35.833 --> 01:13:38.083
He turned you into this.

01:13:41.667 --> 01:13:43.042
Shalla-Bal.

01:13:44.167 --> 01:13:48.083
Those were messages
from the one planet Galactus spared.

01:13:48.167 --> 01:13:49.792
Your planet.

01:13:51.708 --> 01:13:53.958
These planets weren't so lucky.

01:13:56.917 --> 01:13:59.250
How many do you remember, Shalla-Bal?

01:13:59.333 --> 01:14:02.125
Proxima Delphi. Saigas.

01:14:03.125 --> 01:14:04.542
Do you remember Polaris?

01:14:06.750 --> 01:14:09.083
They begged for mercy.

01:14:10.750 --> 01:14:14.167
You brought Galactus
to all of these planets.

01:14:14.250 --> 01:14:17.458
And now, you're bringing him here.

01:14:17.542 --> 01:14:20.625
To my home! To my family!

01:14:38.292 --> 01:14:40.417
Just trying to save my world, you know,

01:14:41.750 --> 01:14:42.917
like you did.

01:14:48.208 --> 01:14:50.333
So give up the child.

01:14:50.417 --> 01:14:53.375
If he was older, he would do it himself.

01:14:54.875 --> 01:14:56.625
Like I did.

01:14:56.708 --> 01:14:58.375
So take me.

01:15:00.417 --> 01:15:02.000
Take me.

01:15:02.083 --> 01:15:03.208
Not the boy.

01:15:05.042 --> 01:15:07.667
Let me make the sacrifice.

01:15:08.875 --> 01:15:11.333
It's not yours to make.

01:15:11.417 --> 01:15:13.500
Then stay and help us.

01:15:14.583 --> 01:15:16.708
There is no help.

01:15:17.958 --> 01:15:21.125
Take the child
and leave this doomed place.

01:15:22.125 --> 01:15:24.833
Maybe you'll live long enough
to forgive yourselves.

01:15:34.500 --> 01:15:37.292
-Johnny, that was incredible.
-I mean, does it even matter?

01:15:37.375 --> 01:15:38.583
You saved Franklin.

01:15:39.250 --> 01:15:40.417
Yes, it matters.

01:15:40.500 --> 01:15:41.583
Reed?

01:15:43.208 --> 01:15:44.333
We're not leaving, are we?

01:15:45.417 --> 01:15:46.833
No. No, we're not.

01:15:50.250 --> 01:15:51.250
We're not leaving.

01:15:59.500 --> 01:16:02.000
Yeah. Same here.
You gotta give us a second.

01:16:02.667 --> 01:16:04.583
Yeah, this is Johnny Storm.
Can you hear me?

01:16:05.125 --> 01:16:07.458
-The line's too busy. I'm sorry, okay?
-This is London.

01:16:07.542 --> 01:16:09.833
-This is London. Do you copy?
-Hold, London.

01:16:09.917 --> 01:16:10.917
What's going on?

01:16:13.417 --> 01:16:15.250
Hold, Paris. Paris, hold.

01:16:15.333 --> 01:16:17.208
-The line's not very clear.
-There's an error. Hold the line.

01:16:19.292 --> 01:16:22.292
Chicago, yes, we're onto it.
We're just... We're fixing the problem.

01:16:27.583 --> 01:16:30.125
We're trying to get...
We're trying to get on top of this.

01:16:30.208 --> 01:16:31.458
Sydney, stand by.

01:16:31.542 --> 01:16:33.292
-Tokyo, stand by.
-Sir, you're going to have to be patient.

01:16:33.375 --> 01:16:34.375
-Hold. Hold.
-Yeah, we're working on...

01:16:34.458 --> 01:16:35.792
-We have to bring him here.
-We're fixing something.

01:16:35.875 --> 01:16:37.042
We are aware.

01:16:37.958 --> 01:16:39.792
Yes, I understand. Can you stand by?

01:16:39.875 --> 01:16:42.208
-We are aware. I'll… I'll update you.
-Yeah.

01:16:42.875 --> 01:16:43.875
Yeah. This is gonna have to...

01:16:43.958 --> 01:16:45.917
We need to bring Galactus here.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:47.500
-I will come back to you. Hold...
-You...

01:16:48.167 --> 01:16:49.375
-Call you back.
-Hold up.

01:16:49.917 --> 01:16:50.917
Reed.

01:16:51.500 --> 01:16:53.417
We need Galactus to come here?

01:16:53.500 --> 01:16:56.250
I feel like we just spent a lot of time
trying to prevent that from happening.

01:16:56.333 --> 01:16:58.292
Listen to me.
We need to get him away from his ship.

01:16:58.375 --> 01:17:01.333
We need to bring him here,
to Times Square.

01:17:01.417 --> 01:17:02.375
And then what?

01:17:02.458 --> 01:17:06.042
And then, instead of moving a planet
away from one giant...

01:17:06.583 --> 01:17:09.042
we move one giant away from the planet.

01:17:09.125 --> 01:17:12.833
If we route every power grid
on the Eastern Seaboard,

01:17:12.917 --> 01:17:14.833
through our one last bridge,

01:17:14.917 --> 01:17:16.417
charge back up,

01:17:16.917 --> 01:17:20.667
we can keep the portal open for...

01:17:29.750 --> 01:17:30.958
Thirty-seven seconds.

01:17:31.042 --> 01:17:35.625
Thirty... Not a lot of time
to throw a space god off a planet.

01:17:35.708 --> 01:17:37.917
-No, it is not.
-And where do we send him?

01:17:38.458 --> 01:17:41.375
To the far edges of the universe.
Without a ship, he'll be stranded.

01:17:41.458 --> 01:17:43.542
How are we supposed to
get Galactus to Times Square?

01:17:43.625 --> 01:17:46.875
And how do we move one giant
through one large bridge?

01:17:50.458 --> 01:17:52.333
I haven't figured that part out yet.

01:17:56.375 --> 01:17:57.458
You have.

01:17:58.417 --> 01:17:59.458
Have what?

01:18:00.167 --> 01:18:02.208
We have to use the only thing
Galactus wants.

01:18:02.292 --> 01:18:04.958
-No. I'll think of another way.
-What are you talking about?

01:18:05.042 --> 01:18:06.667
You can't. You can't think of another way.

01:18:06.750 --> 01:18:08.375
-I will.
-There is only one way.

01:18:08.458 --> 01:18:09.792
What are you talking about?

01:18:12.125 --> 01:18:13.792
We have to use Franklin.

01:18:16.667 --> 01:18:17.667
Yes.

01:18:18.250 --> 01:18:19.375
You wanna use the boy?

01:18:23.125 --> 01:18:24.958
You wanna use the boy as bait.

01:18:25.042 --> 01:18:26.875
-No.
-That's your plan?

01:18:26.958 --> 01:18:28.917
No, it's not my plan. It's our plan.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:30.500
It's the only plan.

01:18:30.583 --> 01:18:32.583
-It's not my plan. I hate that plan.
-It's a bad plan.

01:18:32.667 --> 01:18:34.042
-Come on. That's a stupid plan.
-Terrible idea.

01:18:34.125 --> 01:18:37.542
Why don't I just burn through his ship?
That's another plan.

01:18:37.625 --> 01:18:38.708
It's your kid we're talking about.

01:18:38.792 --> 01:18:40.458
-Sue.
-There's gotta be a different way.

01:18:40.542 --> 01:18:42.333
-I know.
-Sue. Sue.

01:18:42.417 --> 01:18:44.208
Yes, I know. I know. I know!

01:19:13.250 --> 01:19:16.375
I thought this was one of the most
beautiful things we'd ever built.

01:19:19.125 --> 01:19:20.833
Feels terrifying now.

01:19:22.375 --> 01:19:24.083
It can be beautiful again.

01:19:25.667 --> 01:19:27.000
Everything can.

01:19:37.458 --> 01:19:38.542
They've been gone a while.

01:19:40.583 --> 01:19:41.583
Johnny.

01:19:42.375 --> 01:19:43.667
Go check. See if they're back.

01:19:43.750 --> 01:19:46.625
I'm in no rush to do that.

01:19:47.417 --> 01:19:48.875
Well, I'm definitely not gonna check.

01:19:48.958 --> 01:19:51.333
-I'm definitely not going either.
-Thank you for going and checking.

01:19:51.417 --> 01:19:53.083
You're welcome. It's the least I could do

01:19:53.167 --> 01:19:54.458
to say thank you for going down
to check first.

01:19:54.542 --> 01:19:55.958
I'm definitely not going down.

01:19:56.042 --> 01:19:56.958
Chickenshits.

01:19:57.042 --> 01:19:57.875
Jesus.

01:19:58.417 --> 01:19:59.250
Don't do that.

01:19:59.333 --> 01:20:00.833
-I hate it when you do that.
-Don't do that.

01:20:00.917 --> 01:20:03.333
Come on. Let's run through the details.

01:20:05.167 --> 01:20:06.958
I don't like when she does that.

01:20:07.042 --> 01:20:10.917
It's like... It's unsettling
when people just appear like that.

01:20:13.042 --> 01:20:15.250
Bombproof. Shockproof.

01:20:16.333 --> 01:20:17.625
Radiation-proof.

01:20:21.625 --> 01:20:24.375
Franklin will go here
when Galactus arrives.

01:20:25.500 --> 01:20:28.667
Hey, do we know what direction
Galactus will be coming from?

01:20:30.042 --> 01:20:31.292
Well, it could be from anywhere.

01:20:31.375 --> 01:20:34.917
But when he crosses those lines,
we trigger it.

01:20:37.083 --> 01:20:38.958
We're in the very center of the city.

01:20:39.667 --> 01:20:42.833
We're surrounded by
miles of apartment buildings.

01:20:43.750 --> 01:20:44.750
Any path he takes,

01:20:44.833 --> 01:20:48.125
he's gonna be going through
thousands and thousands of families.

01:20:49.875 --> 01:20:51.583
I got an idea you'll hate.

01:20:54.625 --> 01:20:57.333
Oh, my.

01:20:57.417 --> 01:20:59.083
Very advanced.

01:20:59.167 --> 01:21:03.292
So this must be where the sausage is made.

01:21:04.667 --> 01:21:07.167
I think I prefer just trying
to steal the sausage.

01:21:07.250 --> 01:21:08.625
Please, don't touch.

01:21:11.292 --> 01:21:12.292
We'll fix that.

01:21:13.625 --> 01:21:14.875
Harvey...

01:21:14.958 --> 01:21:17.125
Hello there, little robot man.

01:21:17.708 --> 01:21:19.542
Could you dim the lights for me, please?

01:21:21.708 --> 01:21:24.583
Harvey, we wanted to ask you something.

01:21:24.667 --> 01:21:28.292
And whatever it is,
I would like him to ask me.

01:21:28.375 --> 01:21:31.083
It's not Reed or me asking.

01:21:31.167 --> 01:21:32.792
It's the entire planet asking.

01:21:32.875 --> 01:21:35.500
It wouldn't be the entire planet now,
would it? Just the over part.

01:21:35.583 --> 01:21:39.125
No, Mr. Elder. We've met Galactus.
He'll eat the under part first.

01:21:39.208 --> 01:21:43.333
Well, regardless,
why don't you butter me up?

01:21:46.542 --> 01:21:47.625
Spread it on.

01:21:47.708 --> 01:21:49.208
Okay, Mole Man.

01:21:49.292 --> 01:21:51.542
-Mole Man? Really?
-You touch another piece of my--

01:21:51.625 --> 01:21:52.500
Take the "mole" out of it.

01:21:52.583 --> 01:21:53.792
-It's Mr. Elder to you.
-That is enough.

01:21:53.875 --> 01:21:55.875
Give us a minute. Just give us a minute.

01:21:55.958 --> 01:21:57.083
Yes, that's it.

01:21:58.375 --> 01:22:00.583
Johnny, don't be mad. I didn't dress you.

01:22:00.667 --> 01:22:02.583
Don't listen to him. You're handsome.

01:22:03.917 --> 01:22:05.042
Harvey.

01:22:05.125 --> 01:22:06.958
I'm sorry, Sue. I'm...

01:22:07.792 --> 01:22:09.250
End of days.

01:22:09.333 --> 01:22:11.583
We all gotta learn how to laugh.

01:22:12.417 --> 01:22:14.042
So what do you need?

01:22:14.958 --> 01:22:18.458
Evacuation orders are in effect
in the Greater New York area.

01:22:18.542 --> 01:22:20.208
Please report to Subterranea.

01:22:21.167 --> 01:22:24.792
Evacuation orders are in effect
in the Greater New York area.

01:22:24.875 --> 01:22:26.917
Please report to Subterranea.

01:22:33.792 --> 01:22:36.458
Welcome to Subterranea.

01:22:37.375 --> 01:22:38.708
Hello there.

01:22:39.333 --> 01:22:41.333
Welcome, sunshiners.

01:22:41.417 --> 01:22:43.208
Thank you so much.

01:22:43.750 --> 01:22:47.417
Yes, do me a favor
and just wipe your feet upon entering.

01:22:47.500 --> 01:22:49.833
I'm kidding. It's all dirt.

01:22:50.333 --> 01:22:51.792
Please, keep a move on.

01:22:58.042 --> 01:22:59.583
Good evening.

01:22:59.667 --> 01:23:01.500
We, the people of Earth, prepare

01:23:01.583 --> 01:23:04.000
for what could be our final moments.

01:23:05.083 --> 01:23:07.458
The hours ahead may feel long,

01:23:07.958 --> 01:23:10.875
but we must use them
to support each other,

01:23:11.708 --> 01:23:13.250
and we must hope.

01:23:13.875 --> 01:23:15.042
We must dare to hope.

01:23:15.125 --> 01:23:17.167
-Hey, Mrs. H.
-Thank you, Ben.

01:23:19.417 --> 01:23:21.125
We must use the time wisely

01:23:21.208 --> 01:23:23.000
to be with the ones we cherish.

01:23:31.167 --> 01:23:32.917
Keep hope, all right?

01:23:33.833 --> 01:23:34.833
What?

01:23:38.750 --> 01:23:40.333
Sorry, just... Hi.

01:23:40.417 --> 01:23:41.792
-Hey.
-Hey.

01:23:43.083 --> 01:23:45.292
You're looking very distinguished.

01:23:45.375 --> 01:23:47.208
I'm surprised to see you here. I...

01:23:47.292 --> 01:23:49.083
Did you come for spiritual guidance?

01:23:49.625 --> 01:23:51.000
Oh, no, no.

01:23:51.083 --> 01:23:53.542
I just came to see you.

01:24:04.542 --> 01:24:07.167
I leave you tonight with these words.

01:24:08.458 --> 01:24:12.750
"Never doubt that a small group
of thoughtful, committed citizens

01:24:12.833 --> 01:24:14.708
can change the world.

01:24:15.625 --> 01:24:20.708
Indeed, it's the only thing
that ever has."

01:25:09.375 --> 01:25:10.500
Positions.

01:27:41.292 --> 01:27:43.792
Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Don't cry.

01:27:44.833 --> 01:27:46.500
I'll be back in a minute, little guy.

01:27:55.708 --> 01:27:57.167
Just a couple more steps.

01:27:58.292 --> 01:27:59.375
Come on, come on.

01:28:25.042 --> 01:28:26.667
Clever little bugs.

01:28:29.250 --> 01:28:30.542
He's going for Franklin.

01:28:58.667 --> 01:29:00.667
Light him up, Johnny.

01:29:23.875 --> 01:29:25.083
Ben!

01:30:00.667 --> 01:30:01.708
Oh, my God.

01:31:12.792 --> 01:31:14.042
What time is it, Ben?

01:31:14.125 --> 01:31:15.125
No.

01:31:15.208 --> 01:31:17.625
-What time is it, Ben?
-No, Johnny.

01:31:17.708 --> 01:31:19.542
-Say it!
-I don't wanna.

01:31:19.625 --> 01:31:21.208
Say it!

01:31:21.292 --> 01:31:24.458
It's clobberin' time!

01:32:24.083 --> 01:32:27.000
You are my salvation.

01:32:28.250 --> 01:32:31.292
My deliverance from this vicious hunger.

01:32:34.583 --> 01:32:36.792
Time to feed.

01:32:49.792 --> 01:32:51.250
Put down my son.

01:33:39.875 --> 01:33:41.667
Sue. Sue, stop.

01:33:43.292 --> 01:33:45.125
Sue, stop. It's too much.

01:33:45.208 --> 01:33:46.958
-Get Franklin.
-Sue, stop!

01:33:47.042 --> 01:33:48.167
Save our son.

01:33:57.333 --> 01:33:59.083
Johnny, the controls.

01:34:35.333 --> 01:34:36.667
Hang on, Suze!

01:34:55.167 --> 01:34:56.333
Johnny, now!

01:35:45.542 --> 01:35:47.542
Reed! It worked.

01:35:48.625 --> 01:35:49.625
No!

01:36:02.500 --> 01:36:04.500
Tell Franklin Uncle Johnny loves him.

01:36:45.125 --> 01:36:46.125
Sue.

01:36:52.083 --> 01:36:53.042
Sue?

01:36:56.208 --> 01:36:58.333
No, no, no. No, no, no.

01:37:01.833 --> 01:37:03.000
-I got him.
-Sue.

01:37:07.208 --> 01:37:08.458
No.

01:37:08.542 --> 01:37:10.417
No. Sue. Sue.

01:37:12.625 --> 01:37:13.583
-She breathing?
-No.

01:37:14.208 --> 01:37:15.417
No. No, baby. No.

01:37:15.500 --> 01:37:17.417
You stay with us. You stay with us, okay?

01:37:28.458 --> 01:37:31.917
Stay with me, Sue.
Stay with us, baby. Stay with us, baby.

01:37:33.625 --> 01:37:34.458
Come on, Sue.

01:37:34.542 --> 01:37:36.417
Come on, Sue, stay with us.

01:37:36.500 --> 01:37:37.458
Don't leave us, baby.

01:37:38.292 --> 01:37:39.167
Sue!

01:37:40.417 --> 01:37:41.708
Come on, baby!

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:54.208
I'm sorry.

01:39:57.958 --> 01:39:59.125
Hey.

01:40:06.958 --> 01:40:08.250
He's not us.

01:40:08.917 --> 01:40:10.125
He's more.

01:40:42.917 --> 01:40:47.167
Wow, folks. We have so much
exciting ground to cover today.

01:40:47.833 --> 01:40:50.417
The last year, a lot has happened.

01:40:50.500 --> 01:40:51.917
We have seen it with our own eyes,

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.167
but tonight we're gonna
see it through theirs.

01:40:54.250 --> 01:40:56.833
Our city, our country and our planet...

01:40:56.917 --> 01:40:59.042
No. And there's nothing
to be nervous about.

01:40:59.125 --> 01:41:02.542
You just stick with me. This thing
will be done before we know it.

01:41:03.125 --> 01:41:05.917
...obvious to say, but it is
definitely worth talking about,

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:10.167
is the fact that the surfboard
is not part of the body.

01:41:10.250 --> 01:41:13.042
Okay. So, Ted wanted me
to give you something

01:41:13.125 --> 01:41:14.917
as a thank-you for doing this.

01:41:16.792 --> 01:41:17.875
Interesting.

01:41:17.958 --> 01:41:21.292
He would love it if Franklin would
wear it for this in one minute.

01:41:23.042 --> 01:41:24.667
-No, actually.
-No. Absolutely not.

01:41:24.750 --> 01:41:26.333
No, I don't think we can.

01:41:26.417 --> 01:41:28.083
Well, I will break the bad news.

01:41:28.167 --> 01:41:29.708
-Thank you, Lynne.
-You're welcome.

01:41:29.792 --> 01:41:31.125
Places, please.

01:41:31.208 --> 01:41:32.958
-It's too early.
-Way too early.

01:41:33.042 --> 01:41:34.375
It's too early for that kind of stuff.

01:41:34.458 --> 01:41:36.000
He can't even sit up without help.

01:41:36.083 --> 01:41:37.792
I did not have time
to eat breakfast this morning...

01:41:37.875 --> 01:41:40.333
-You need something?
-...so if only I could eat a magic baby.

01:41:44.542 --> 01:41:46.833
-Get his hair. Get that hair.
-No. Don't... Don't try me.

01:41:46.917 --> 01:41:49.417
Who knows where his powers will take him?

01:41:50.667 --> 01:41:53.000
But right now, he's here.

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:58.458
What's that guy doing?

01:41:59.458 --> 01:42:00.917
-Who's that right there?
-Hi, cutie.

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:03.167
Frankie.

01:42:05.042 --> 01:42:06.125
You got him?

01:42:06.208 --> 01:42:09.125
Explorers, heroes, citizens or leaders.

01:42:09.208 --> 01:42:10.792
They continue to change,

01:42:10.875 --> 01:42:14.333
becoming whatever we need them to be
whenever we need.

01:42:14.417 --> 01:42:15.958
-We're going in ten...
-Ladies and gentlemen,

01:42:16.042 --> 01:42:18.250
just when you thought
we couldn't love, admire

01:42:18.333 --> 01:42:20.667
or appreciate them any more than we do,

01:42:21.375 --> 01:42:24.542
and they're now 25% more fantastic,

01:42:26.125 --> 01:42:31.458
Reed, Sue, Johnny, Ben
and Franklin, the Fantastic Five!

01:42:39.125 --> 01:42:41.292
Precious cargo. Coming through.

01:42:44.875 --> 01:42:46.167
Is this...

01:42:46.250 --> 01:42:47.250
No, I've set that already.

01:42:47.333 --> 01:42:49.458
-You've already set it?
-Let's get this car seat in nice.

01:42:49.542 --> 01:42:50.792
All right, just make sure that it...

01:42:50.875 --> 01:42:52.333
-Hold on, wait. Set the...
-Right, pull up.

01:42:52.417 --> 01:42:54.500
Wait, wait. I gotta set it in first
before you close it.

01:42:54.583 --> 01:42:56.417
-Set it in before you...
-There.

01:42:58.750 --> 01:43:01.250
It's gonna make that noise until
you thread the belt under the chair...

01:43:01.333 --> 01:43:03.208
-All right.
-...and you get it through the other side.

01:43:03.292 --> 01:43:06.125
-You gotta feed it through the buckle.
-Yeah. I'm doing it.

01:43:06.208 --> 01:43:07.875
-Well, I don't feel anything.
-I can't...

01:43:07.958 --> 01:43:10.083
-Johnny, you just hook it under the chair.
-Yep, it's through.

01:43:10.167 --> 01:43:11.792
-All right, I got it.
-Through the buckle.

01:43:11.875 --> 01:43:12.875
Let's move this along, fellas.

01:43:12.958 --> 01:43:14.333
You gotta thread it. You gotta...

01:43:14.417 --> 01:43:16.083
That's not... That isn't gonna help.

01:43:16.167 --> 01:43:17.542
You gotta thread it through, connect it

01:43:17.625 --> 01:43:19.417
-and then pull the slack.
-I've thread it through.

01:43:19.500 --> 01:43:21.250
Yeah, but you didn't pull the slack.

01:43:21.333 --> 01:43:22.708
Just push from above. Push from above.

01:43:22.792 --> 01:43:24.500
-No, you gotta...
-Pull the slack!

01:43:24.583 --> 01:43:26.667
Okay, I'll get-- I've pulled the slack.
It's thread through.

01:43:26.750 --> 01:43:28.208
-All right.
-I can't fit my hands in there.

01:43:28.292 --> 01:43:31.667
You from the left. You from above.
Three, two, one.

01:43:33.375 --> 01:43:34.292
Got it.

01:43:34.375 --> 01:43:36.833
-Yes! Yes!
-That's a good sound.

01:43:36.917 --> 01:43:38.333
Okay, we're ready.

01:45:44.833 --> 01:45:46.417
"He pushed his way out

01:45:48.333 --> 01:45:50.833
-and he was a butterfly."
-"He was a butterfly."

01:45:55.417 --> 01:45:57.083
You want the other book, don't you?

01:45:57.167 --> 01:45:58.583
-Yeah.
-Okay.

01:45:59.083 --> 01:46:00.083
Back in a second, babe.

01:46:02.292 --> 01:46:04.833
H.E.R.B.I.E., have you seen
the book that Franklin loves?

01:46:06.292 --> 01:46:09.208
Not that one. We did that one yesterday,
and I know he loves it, but thi...

01:46:09.292 --> 01:46:10.708
Here we are. It's here.

01:46:11.917 --> 01:46:14.917
You see, we're going for something
a little bit more fun today. Yeah?

01:53:49.875 --> 01:53:52.917
Changed by cosmic rays from space

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:56.167
Now they save the human race

01:53:56.250 --> 01:53:58.708
Sue Storm commands the light

01:53:59.625 --> 01:54:02.292
Johnny's flames burn blazing bright

01:54:02.375 --> 01:54:05.125
Ben is rocking the world with might
