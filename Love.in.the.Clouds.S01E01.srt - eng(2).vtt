{\an8}ADAPTED FROM BAI LU CHENG SHUANG'S
"LOVE IN THE CLOUDS"

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.920
EPISODE 1

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:36.280
I am

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.840
Ming Xian,
Crown Prince of Yaoguang Mountain.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:39.840
Since I was 13,

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.920
I have fought in the Qingyun Tournament.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.440
I've brought victory to Yaoguang Mountain
for seven consecutive years.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.440
Since childhood, I've used
magic to disguise myself as a man.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.040
In the eyes of others, I am a man.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.680
They call me
the mightiest Warrior God of Hexu

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:58.800
and see me as a hero.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.000
But I am no hero.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.920
MING ZHENGHUI,
EMPEROR OF YAOGUANG MOUNTAIN

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.760
I simply never dared to relax,

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.400
because winning
the Blessed Rain is my duty.

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:11.840
Ever since I could remember,

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.400
I've been told that I could only win,

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.400
that I must win,
and that I must keep winning.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.640
- Ming Xian!
- Ming Xian!

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.440
JI BOZAI, A WARRIOR OF JIXING ABYSS

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.480
I knew there was a fish
that slipped through the net.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.160
Why do you not strike?

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.160
Why have they both vanished?

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.040
Ming Xian can't
lose to Jixing Abyss, right?

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.280
Of course he won.

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:35.560
Your Highness, can we really
defeat Ming Xian this time?

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.600
My spiritual power is
restrained in this space.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.360
I can't even maintain my armor.

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:49.840
This man is no ordinary fighter.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.160
A Jixing Abyss warrior
with such spiritual power…

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.520
Who are you really?

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.840
You are trapped in my Spirit Well,

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:05.680
yet you still speak with such conceit?

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.360
Even within your Spirit Well,

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.800
I can defeat you with weakened strength.

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:12.320
Is that so?

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.440
Impressive, Warrior God.

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.160
You even forged
a weapon with your own blood.

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:04.920
I will win.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.000
That is the only thing I know.

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:09.600
Everyone can lose.

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.240
You can too.

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.400
JING SHU, EMPRESS OF YAOGUANG MOUNTAIN

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.280
- Ming Xian is defeated?
- Look, Father!

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.200
He's severely injured.

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.240
- Yes.
- How disappointing.

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:43.320
In this tournament of two realms,

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.240
Jixing Abyss wins!

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:47.160
Jixing Abyss rises.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.800
Yaoguang Mountain falls.

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:52.320
Let the Blessed Rain descend!

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:54.280
Your Highness, we have won!

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:56.320
I knew I did not misjudge him.

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:14.120
{\an8}- Blessed Rain!
- It's the Blessed Rain!

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:16.400
{\an8}- It really is the Blessed Rain!
- It really is the Blessed Rain!

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.520
Seven years have passed.

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:23.400
The Blessed Rain has
finally descended upon Jixing Abyss!

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:31.360
How dare this loser show his face?

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:32.800
- Exactly!
- Right!

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:34.120
- It's all his fault!
- How dare he?

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:35.160
Right!

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:37.280
The Blessed Rain was
within reach, yet he let it slip away!

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:38.320
Without the Blessed Rain,

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:40.040
Yaoguang Mountain's
spirit light will fade,

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:41.200
and the land will dry up!

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:42.200
Without the Blessed Rain,

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:43.480
no spirit stones will form.

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:45.080
How are we going to live?

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:46.400
Exactly.

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:48.760
You don't deserve to be our Warrior God!

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:51.960
How can we survive?

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:53.400
We are doomed.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.400
I am Ming Xian,
Crown Prince of Yaoguang Mountain.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.480
Since I was 13, I have
fought in the Qingyun Tournament.

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:10.880
I won for seven consecutive years,

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:14.360
yet it feels as though I never won at all.

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:26.480
YAOGUANG PALACE, YAOGUANG MOUNTAIN

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:28.480
CHAMBER OF EASE, YAOGUANG MOUNTAIN

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:39.559
Ming Xian!

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:41.240
Ming Xian, what happened to you?

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:43.480
TWENTY-SEVEN,
MING XIAN'S COMPANION BEAST

00:08:43.559 --> 00:08:44.400
Twenty-Seven,

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:47.320
my spiritual veins are broken.

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:51.000
How can that be?

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:53.920
It seems I have been poisoned,

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:55.960
by something potent.

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:12.200
He did it.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.360
Despicable.

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:21.720
Mother.

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:25.640
I order you to leave.

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:27.080
Depart Yaoguang Mountain at once.

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:34.520
Mother, are you banishing me?

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:35.880
Your spiritual veins are severed.

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:38.440
If you remain here, you will only die

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:40.480
at the hands of those
coveting the Crown Prince's seat.

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:41.960
Mother,

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:43.880
I can restore my spiritual veins.

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:46.000
At the next Qingyun Tournament,

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:47.440
I will win back a thousandfold

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:49.360
of what Yaoguang Mountain has lost.

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:51.520
I can still be of use to you.

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.520
Please, do not send me away.

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:56.560
Ming Xian, listen.

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:59.080
I am not casting you out.

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:00.920
I just want you to live and be safe.

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:02.720
How laughable my life has been,

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:05.920
ever cautious, walking on thin ice.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.880
From the moment you were born,

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:09.280
I made you use the Veil of Illusion

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:11.000
to take on the guise of a prince.

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:16.120
You could have
lived as a simple fairy maiden.

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:20.080
This supreme art of deception

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.120
has made you appear to all

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:24.760
as a man.

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:29.280
But with your spiritual veins broken,

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:32.080
all we've done is now in vain.

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:34.920
Ming Xian,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.760
staying in Yaoguang Mountain

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:38.360
will only bring you danger.

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:39.840
I am letting you go.

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:41.720
Remove the Veil of Illusion

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:44.680
and return to your true form.

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:46.760
No one will know who you are.

00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:49.320
Live well,

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:51.760
and never come back.

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:01.720
Mother, don't worry.

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:04.080
I will restore my spiritual veins

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:06.040
and rejoin the tournament one day.

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:13.080
TWO MONTHS LATER

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:17.040
MOONLIT BLOSSOMS, JIXING ABYSS

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:43.440
MOONLIT BLOSSOMS

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:52.040
Immortal Ji?

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:55.360
I am going to another immortal then.

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:56.280
Don't go.

00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:01.920
Immortal Ji, you really treat
Moonlit Blossoms as your own home.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.760
The moment the Qingyun Tournament ended,

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:05.080
you came here.

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.960
You've even stayed here
longer than I have.

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:10.920
I fought bitterly in the tournament

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.760
for no other reason

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:15.320
than to have whatever I wanted.

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:17.920
No, you want

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.640
whatever I have.

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:22.440
Oh?

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:24.360
Then tell me,

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:29.600
what do you have?

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:36.000
Immortal Ji, have a grape.

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:44.560
With so many fairies waiting here for me,

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:47.560
I shouldn't favor one over another, right?

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:50.760
Many thanks, Immortal Ji!

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:56.880
Sir, please.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
MING XIAN,
CROWN PRINCE OF YAOGUANG MOUNTAIN

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:05.400
MING YI,
AN ATTENDANT OF MOONLIT BLOSSOMS

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:09.760
That Ji Bozai…

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:11.480
Since winning the Qingyun Tournament,

00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:14.280
he's spent his days in debauchery.

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:16.640
As expected, he is a shameless scoundrel.

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:19.600
Two months have passed,
yet I still cannot get close to him.

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:22.200
Today, he's hosting
a grand banquet to celebrate

00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:23.680
being named the Qingyun Warrior.

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:26.840
I must seize this chance to approach him.

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:31.440
I heard from my friends
about the Qingyun Tournament.

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:33.560
You know how it is in places like this.

00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:35.880
One tale can turn
into hundreds of versions.

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:41.160
They say you fight valiantly
and are unmatched in battle.

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:42.080
SUN LIAO, A WARRIOR OF JIXING ABYSS

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:43.720
Surely you couldn't have been

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:46.480
defeated by Ming Xian with a single move.

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:48.960
Who said I was?

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:51.520
Was it Ji Bozai?

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:54.080
No, Immortal Sun.

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:56.560
Ji Bozai is full of nonsense.

00:13:58.520 --> 00:13:59.560
What…

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:02.480
What does this have
to do with Immortal Ji?

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:04.400
Then why did you say such things to me?

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:06.000
You're mistaken, Immortal Sun.

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:07.000
I only meant…

00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:09.360
Now.

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:23.400
First, play the damsel in distress.

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:25.000
Then I'll get close to him.

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:31.600
Excuse me.

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:34.640
He didn't fall for it?

00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:45.000
Did you think
Immortal Ji would take your side?

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:49.200
Immortal Sun, this is a misunderstanding.

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:52.360
Immortal Ji
never said a word about you to me.

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:54.080
Please, don't blame him.

00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:56.960
Ji Bozai,

00:14:57.760 --> 00:14:59.960
have you been spreading rumors
about how I fared in the tournament?

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:03.160
You, a former Sunken Abyss prisoner,
only gained spiritual veins by chance

00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:05.440
and became a warrior
through Princess Tianji's favor.

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:07.040
What,

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:09.520
is gossip behind people's backs
all you're good for?

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:22.440
Sun Liao,

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:24.600
you are actually quite skilled.

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:28.440
It's just
that Ming Xian struck too quickly.

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:29.360
You…!

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:36.640
What a pity.
You are a step too late again.

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:38.560
You…

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:44.000
Well, well, once again I see you

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:46.560
fighting for the sake

00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:48.240
of a fairy maiden, Immortal Ji.

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:55.800
Sun Liao,

00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:58.840
this is Immortal Ji's celebratory banquet.

00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:00.040
Don't make a scene.

00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:06.440
Consider yourself lucky.

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:22.800
This man is truly hard to approach.

00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:24.960
I must think of another way.

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:32.280
Immortal Ji, the food and wine are ready.

00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:33.360
The banquet may begin.

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:41.680
Congratulations, Immortal Ji,
on winning the Qingyun Tournament.

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:43.720
May I have the honor of toasting you?

00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:47.000
Immortal Ji, your valor in the tournament

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:48.920
brought the Blessed Rain to Jixing Abyss.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:49.960
It is an honor to see you today.

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:51.360
Allow me to toast you.

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:54.600
Master said my time was running out.

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:56.720
Ming Xian, let me see your injury
from the Qingyun Tournament.

00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:58.320
Master, I don't know what poison it is,

00:16:58.400 --> 00:16:59.600
but my spiritual veins are broken.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.520
Listen. The poison in you is called

00:17:08.599 --> 00:17:09.720
Heavenly Grief.

00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:13.079
For those with spiritual veins,
it destroys them.

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:15.440
For those without, it grants them.

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:18.440
From now on,
don't use your spiritual veins again,

00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:20.240
or the poison will only spread faster.

00:17:20.319 --> 00:17:22.440
This mark is called the Grief Blossom.

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:24.000
When all seven petals fall,

00:17:24.079 --> 00:17:25.880
your primordial spirit will be burned out.

00:17:28.079 --> 00:17:30.360
So, within a year,

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:31.800
you must find
the antidote, Golden Millet Dream,

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:34.200
and take it to
restore your spiritual veins,

00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:35.760
or you will die.

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:39.480
Since the poison came from Ji Bozai,

00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:41.560
he may hold the Golden Millet Dream.

00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:43.920
Go to Jixing Abyss and find him.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.560
Once I get rid of the pursuers,
I will come to you.

00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:58.440
He refuses food and drink from others
because he fears they might be poisoned.

00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:01.000
Truly, an evil man
sees evil in all things.

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:02.800
Lord Hanfeng has arrived!

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:06.080
No need for formalities.

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:08.360
I cannot stand them.

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:09.760
Hands down, all of you.

00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:11.400
From now on, act like Bozai.

00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:13.360
Wherever you see me,

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:15.080
greet me as you would an old friend.

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:16.480
Wouldn't that be nice?

00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:18.640
Lord Hanfeng, was that a dig at me?

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:20.320
I wouldn't dare disrespect you.

00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:22.240
When I was still a prisoner,

00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:24.960
I had to kneel even to a noble's pet.

00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:26.440
Though I am better off now,

00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:28.040
I ask only for a life
where I need not bow.

00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:32.680
I've always liked this side of you.

00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:34.280
Today is a fine day, Bozai.

00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:36.120
You've been named the Qingyun Warrior.

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:38.320
I've brought a small gift to
express my congratulations.

00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:42.560
Your Wugui Sea is far too desolate.

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:45.320
Even the one servant
you have is already old.

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:46.240
That's hardly acceptable.

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:50.160
My niece Tianji is the one to blame.

00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:53.200
Though she is in charge of
Jixing Abyss's Shouhua Academy,

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:54.800
she has yet to live up to her station.

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:56.720
She didn't even think
to assign you attendants.

00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:59.840
Today, I've brought you two maids.

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:03.520
From now on, they can handle
your accounts and household tasks.

00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:06.800
Bozai, are
you happy with this gift of mine?

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:12.800
Lord Hanfeng, must you keep
such a close eye on Wugui Sea?

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:18.480
Just as I thought,
there are rifts within Jixing Abyss.

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:21.560
It's not that I don't appreciate it.

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:24.800
Tonight's feast
is hosted by Princess Tianji in my honor,

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:28.280
yet you suddenly arrived with two maids.

00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:32.440
If I take them back,
won't that upset Princess Tianji?

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:39.320
So you dare not offend Princess Tianji,

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:42.320
but you have no fear of offending me?

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:47.920
Bozai,
are you sure you are turning down my gift?

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:52.400
Is Immortal Ji really
turning down Lord Hanfeng's gift?

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:53.320
He's turning it down?

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:55.760
Won't Lord Hanfeng be offended?

00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:56.680
This is my chance.

00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:00.760
I object! Lord Ji, you just promised

00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:02.560
to take me back to Wugui Sea.

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:09.840
Did I say that?

00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:12.640
You did.

00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:21.240
I must have made too many promises
and forgotten.

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:27.520
Then why don't you
take all three back with you?

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:29.760
- Wouldn't that make quite a story?
- Right.

00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:31.320
Yes, take all of them back.

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:32.600
That's a fine idea.

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:34.520
I will have carriages and boats prepared

00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:35.640
to send you all back together.

00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:37.080
- Great!
- Good idea!

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:38.200
Take them all back!

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:40.960
Yes, take them all!

00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:41.760
- Right.
- Yes, take them all back.

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:43.120
- No way!
- Exactly.

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:44.120
There isn't enough room!

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:45.640
Wugui Sea may be remote,

00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:48.920
but as Immortal Ji's reward,

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.120
it is spacious and tranquil.

00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:52.920
I'm sure it can hold
more than a few people.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:53.880
- Yes!
- Naturally!

00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:55.080
- Exactly!
- Well said!

00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:57.280
- Immortal Ji should take them all back!
- Lord Ji…

00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:58.920
That's right!

00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:00.360
Hold on.

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:04.760
Everyone, Wugui Sea is not a fish pond.

00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:07.680
Besides, my energy is limited.

00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:08.880
Here's what we'll do.

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:11.400
Ladies, I will ask you one question,

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:13.400
and I will take
the one who pleases me most

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:14.880
with her answer.

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:16.040
How about that?

00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:17.680
- Good idea!
- Great!

00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:20.280
Let's do it!

00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:23.160
Since you are to serve in my abode,

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:27.280
tell me, what spirit beasts
are kept in Wugui Sea,

00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:29.480
and how would you tend to them?

00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:32.080
The water in Wugui Sea is stagnant.
Nothing can survive there.

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:34.960
But if I give the right answer,
I could draw suspicion.

00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:38.960
You go first. Yes, you.

00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:43.360
Wugui Sea…

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:46.280
Like rivers, lakes, and ponds,

00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:49.400
it has… turtles,

00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:53.320
fish, and shrimp, right?

00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:00.760
Lord Ji, my loyalty to you

00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:02.240
surpasses any spirit beast,

00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:04.080
and my devotion is
deeper than the Wugui Sea.

00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:09.840
Your turn.

00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:12.000
The water in Wugui Sea is stagnant.

00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:13.600
Nothing can survive there.

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:16.360
There isn't a single spirit beast there.

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:17.360
That's right.

00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:19.120
Ignorant fairy,

00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:20.840
do you really know Immortal Ji at all?

00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:22.320
Do you even know what he likes?

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:26.840
Lord Ji, please give me one more chance.
I'll get it right this time.

00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:28.080
She knows nothing.

00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:29.920
Even if he gave
her another chance, it would be wasted.

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:32.080
Lord Ji…

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:35.440
She's asking for a second chance?

00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:38.160
This fairy keeps pestering Immortal Ji.

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:39.320
Could it be…?

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:41.040
Immortal Ji would never choose her.

00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:42.880
Those two know Immortal Ji so well.

00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:44.200
Surely he'll pick either of them.

00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:46.360
Lord Hanfeng's choices are never wrong.

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:49.880
I choose…

00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:55.840
her.

00:22:57.800 --> 00:22:58.880
What?

00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:00.680
- Her?
- I envy her.

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:02.360
- Me too.
- I was once a prisoner,

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:06.600
so I know all things in
this world are meaningless,

00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:09.480
and only true
devotion deserves to be valued.

00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:10.600
This lady…

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:13.960
- Your name?
- Ming Yi.

00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:14.920
Ming Yi.

00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:18.240
Fairy Ming Yi is so devoted to me,

00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:20.000
laying bare her heart to me.

00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:21.360
How could I let her down?

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:23.880
Rest assured.

00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:25.680
I will never fail you.

00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:30.440
As for you two,

00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:32.960
it seems
we are just fated to be strangers.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.240
He is tough to handle.

00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:47.240
Still, I'm one step closer to my goal.

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:50.720
WUGUI SEA, JIXING ABYSS

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:04.200
GRANNY XUN, STEWARD OF WUGUI SEA

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.640
Your Lordship, you're back.

00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:19.240
Lord Ji,

00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:23.560
why did you cover my eyes

00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:25.200
the moment we arrived?

00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:40.080
Because I like it.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.080
Lord Hanfeng,

00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:50.280
Ji Bozai carried that fairy
into the chamber.

00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:13.160
Lord Ji,

00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:16.080
it must be nearly dawn.

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:18.000
Why not take this blindfold off me?

00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:23.240
Lord Ji…

00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:30.280
Tonight, you went to great lengths,

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:33.360
putting on a show,

00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:35.680
just so you could follow
me back to Wugui Sea, right?

00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:38.280
You got what you wanted.

00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:42.760
You saw right through me, Lord Ji.

00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:44.320
Well done,

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:46.920
keeping the acts coming one after another.

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:50.480
I dismissed two fairies,
and then you showed up.

00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:01.240
And your little scene with Sun Liao?
Truly well-coordinated.

00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:06.080
That's unfair, Lord Ji.

00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:07.880
Questioning my devotion to you

00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:10.120
by bringing up
Sun Liao is just humiliating!

00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:14.480
That's true.

00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:17.200
Could you remove the blindfold for me?

00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:18.800
I don't like this.
It feels like an interrogation.

00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:20.280
Answer my question first.

00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:28.760
Lord Ji,

00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:32.720
do you enjoy questioning women like this?

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:35.600
I never thought you had such a hobby.

00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:41.840
Thank you, Lord…

00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:46.000
Lord Ji?

00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:55.440
Lord Ji,

00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:57.400
is it really so strange that I want

00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:58.800
to follow you back to Wugui Sea?

00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:00.240
Once a Sunken Abyss prisoner,

00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:01.440
you rose to fame in one battle.

00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:03.280
You are a living legend in Jixing Abyss,

00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:05.960
the man we fairies of
Moonlit Blossoms admire most!

00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:08.640
I've given you all my heart,

00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:11.680
yet you are so cold to me.

00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:13.480
I am heartbroken.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:14.920
Don't treat me this way again.

00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:19.960
Your name

00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:22.440
is Ming Yi?

00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:27.160
"Ming," as in "bright,"
like the moon in your heart.

00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:32.320
and "Yi," as in "feelings,"
like the deep ones I hold for you.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.000
Before you worked at Moonlit Blossoms,

00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:38.000
what did you do?

00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:39.960
He's still interrogating me.

00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:41.560
The more I say, the more risk I take.

00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:43.520
I need to silence him somehow.

00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:47.440
My family once lived by gathering herbs.

00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:50.440
After my parents died,

00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:51.960
I came to Moonlit Blossoms.

00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:55.120
- So you…
- Why so many questions?

00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:56.080
Do you not trust me?

00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:58.280
No, you simply don't like me.

00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:00.800
If you dislike me,
why did you bring me back here?

00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:30.160
Are you all right?

00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:49.960
I don't like women who come on too strong.

00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:01.800
Seriously? How desperate is he?

00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:11.200
Fine then.

00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:33.280
What's Twenty-Seven doing?

00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:34.640
Why hasn't he acted yet?

00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:28.680
There's a fire outside. I'll go check.

00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:44.440
Lord… Lord Ji, what happened?

00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:51.880
Your Lordship,
the pavilion at the back is on fire.

00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:53.200
Please come and see.

00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:55.360
Let's go and check.

00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:59.080
I can't let you come along.

00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:00.760
You don't know your way around Wugui Sea.

00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:01.880
What if something happens to you?

00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:05.520
I will be fine…

00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:10.280
This barrier

00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:12.320
can only be passed
through by Granny Xun and me.

00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:13.240
No one else can enter,

00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:14.880
and you cannot leave either.

00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:16.960
This way, you are completely safe.

00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:19.280
Wait for me here.

00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:25.520
Ugh, that man.

00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:04.640
Ming Yi,

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:06.920
with your spiritual veins broken,

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:08.360
you are like an ordinary person now.

00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:11.160
You only have a little power
for simple spells.

00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:12.760
Don't push yourself.

00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:16.160
- I know.
- Are you all right?

00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:18.600
Didn't Master She warn you
not to use your spiritual veins?

00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:20.040
What if the Grief Blossom withers?

00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:22.520
Using this little power
won't stir my spiritual veins.

00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:23.840
This is a complex barrier.

00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:25.240
I have to break it myself.

00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:27.520
I only asked you to make some noise

00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:28.920
to keep him from staying the night.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:29.840
Why did you go so far?

00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:32.920
I am puzzled too.
I did exactly as you said.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:36.120
I cast a small spell
on that pavilion over there

00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:37.720
to create just a tiny flame.

00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:39.360
But somehow, it grew into a blaze.

00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:41.120
I don't understand how.

00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:43.080
Never mind. Get down
to business while he's out.

00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:44.000
Where is the thing?

00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:04.440
Trouble arose right after Ming Yi arrived.

00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:06.320
Rest assured, Your Lordship.

00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:09.080
- I will find the cause of the fire.
- No need.

00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:10.800
It is only a natural fire.

00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:12.240
No need to alarm an outsider.

00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:19.400
I don't like women who come on too strong.

00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:22.680
I need to stall a bit longer.

00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:34.320
Why are there so few layers to this robe?

00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:40.680
Why hasn't Buxiu started the fire?

00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:44.200
I will put the fire out myself.

00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:49.680
WUGUI SEA, JIXING ABYSS

00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:53.560
In these two months in Jixing Abyss,

00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:56.760
we've learned
that Ji Bozai's spiritual veins

00:33:56.840 --> 00:33:58.720
were formed through Heavenly Grief.

00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:00.720
Since he used it,

00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:02.840
without the Golden Millet Dream,

00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:04.320
he would have died already.

00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:07.480
The fact that he's still alive

00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:09.199
means he must have the antidote.

00:34:23.159 --> 00:34:24.320
It's not here.

00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:37.639
And it's not here. Where could it be?

00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:46.760
The Heavenly Grief and Golden Millet Dream
respond intensely to one another.

00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:48.280
Using this locator
forged with your poisoned blood,

00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:50.199
we should be able to find it.

00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:52.560
- I'll check over there.
- Your Lordship, mind the steps.

00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:57.120
They are coming back! Hide quickly…

00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:01.400
You ran off on your own?

00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:05.120
We have been gone so long.

00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:08.160
I wonder if that little fairy
waited as she was told.

00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:11.720
SHEDDING THE OLD AND EMBRACING THE NEW

00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:26.080
The Confinement Barrier is broken!

00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:47.080
Your Lordship, she's not inside.

00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:54.240
SHEDDING THE OLD AND EMBRACING THE NEW
