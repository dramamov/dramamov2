=Episode 3=

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.310
But so many years have passed.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.310
Your appearance has changed greatly.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.510
How did this family

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.680
recognize you?

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:56.450
For the next few days,

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:57.680
keep a close eye on them.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:59.980
I'll also find an opportunity

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.230
to probe their background.

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:07.900
To let our ancestor's guard down,

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:08.910
and then find a way home

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:09.910
from Yunshui Manor,

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:12.430
our whole family will pretend to be

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.190
poor relatives who have climbed up

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:15.810
to the new nobility.

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:16.790
Round 1.

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.190
Jicai, Jicai.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:19.870
Jicai, come with me over there.

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:20.710
There's a restroom.

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:21.740
The privy.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.120
I've never seen such a nice privy

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.870
in my whole life.

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.030
Are you crazy, Shen Gongcai?

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.770
You want me to go see a privy
with you now?

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:27.830
It'll surely impress you.

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:28.870
- I won't go.
- Come here.

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.640
Look. As I told you, it's beautiful.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.280
You must've never seen anything like it.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.280
(Privy)
Come on, look.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.800
- Right here.
- So clean?

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.030
The toilet paper is even scented.

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.500
Exactly.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.870
Look at the bottom of the toilet.

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.430
It's lined with a layer of fine powder.

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:41.900
The attention to detail here.

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.000
It won't splash.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:44.840
Feel it, feel it.

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.870
Join me.

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:50.740
This is better than modern facilities.

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:52.610
I'm sure I can sit here
without getting numb

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:53.720
in my legs.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.360
They've never even used a good toilet.

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.590
- This courtyard is huge.
- Round 2.

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.030
How much must this have cost?

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:02.630
As expected of the Vice Prefect.

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:03.470
Yes.

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:05.120
There's even a waterside pavilion.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.530
This is much better than our house

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:07.270
in the countryside.

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:08.190
Yes, yes.

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.870
Great.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.320
We've been pretending to be poor

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.530
for three rounds now.

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:13.910
My legs are sore.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.560
You just need more exercise.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.680
Shall we put on a show
of being a close-knit family?

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.310
Just like this.

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:21.360
Enough.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:22.840
Why push me?

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.520
Be quiet. They are watching.

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.120
We want them to see.

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:27.560
We just want them to see.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.520
Look at you.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.400
Be gentle; it hurts.

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.160
Round 3.

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:44.170
Dad,

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:45.870
Auntie said this tooth powder

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.520
has ginger and astragalus in it.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:48.870
It's for protecting the teeth.

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:53.150
It's true.

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.680
Yangyang, the bristles of the toothbrush

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:57.890
seem to be made of horsehair.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.380
Didn't that performer at the inn say

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.010
that only instruments use horsehair?

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:02.310
It's all because we were

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:03.270
too poor before.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.030
With this, I can eat
as much candy as I want.

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.290
I'm going to brush three times.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:08.590
That's too unambitious.

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:09.680
At least five times.

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.200
Thank you.

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.220
The Vice Prefect is here.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:33.640
Get up.

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:35.960
- Vice Prefect.
- Vice Prefect.

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.270
We've been here for a while.

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.240
Isn't the chef here slow?

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.240
The main dishes
still haven't been served.

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.260
They've all been served.

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:46.110
Here's the thing.

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:47.430
Our young master

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:50.070
never likes to fuss over food.

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:52.360
If you're not used to it,

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:53.440
you can

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:54.560
leave on your own.

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.080
- No.
- Liu Chang.

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:57.230
Be polite.

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:58.820
Yes, yes.

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:01.510
Actually, we're indeed disturbing you.

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:02.750
- It's fine.
- Yes.

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.800
The guest follows the host's lead.

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:08.670
The guest follows the host's lead?

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:10.560
Uncle, you're really easygoing.

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:12.560
For example,

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:15.600
I haven't greeted you today.

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:17.800
Usually, elders

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.920
would've sent someone to ask.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:21.630
No, no.

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:22.510
Greet?

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:30.310
I'll make up for my lack of manners now.

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.070
Greetings, Uncle, Auntie.

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.160
I respectfully invite you

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:35.350
to have a meal.

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.000
- Don't.
- Don't do this.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:37.840
Vice Prefect, don't.

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:43.870
Don't, don't.

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:50.630
Not again.

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:51.590
Vice Prefect,

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:53.120
you can't do this.

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.040
It's not appropriate.

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.200
Uncle, Auntie, this is inappropriate.

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:58.510
No, it's okay.

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:00.070
No, Vice Prefect.

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:01.190
We must do this;

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:02.350
otherwise,

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.070
we'd be losing years of life.

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:05.190
Yes, yes.

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:06.270
It's not appropriate.

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:12.000
Uncle, Auntie, what are you thinking?

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:13.310
How can you bow

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.070
to a junior like me?

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:16.800
Well...

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:19.800
Please understand.

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:21.870
My parents can't bear

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:23.510
a dignified Vice Prefect

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:24.870
bowing to them.

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.430
We're all commoners,

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:27.800
living here for free.

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:29.680
How could we possibly accept your bow?

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:30.910
- Yes.
- That's right.

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:32.090
If anyone should bow,

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:33.510
it should be us bowing to you.

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:34.390
Yes.

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:37.120
We're at home.

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:38.800
I'm just a junior,

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:39.790
not the Vice Prefect.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.190
There's no need to be so formal with me.

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:44.830
Vice Prefect, that'll be great.

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:45.960
From now on,

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:47.590
let's not worry about these formalities.

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:48.830
Let's eat.

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:50.710
Eat.

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:52.600
Vice Prefect, sit.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.390
Have a seat, Vice Prefect.

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:18.750
Vice Prefect, don't mind us.

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:21.190
We're used to being casual
in the countryside.

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:23.000
We're not very proper when we eat.

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:29.800
Yes, yes.

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.800
After we were engaged,

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:42.190
it seems there was no contact.

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:44.600
(Probing us again.)

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:45.950
(Grandpa didn't tell me)

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:47.190
(everything about the Cuis.)

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.430
(Our ancestor doesn't have
much of an accent.)

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:50.690
(He must've come to Yong'an)

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:52.250
(when he was very young.)

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:55.270
Your family later moved to the Capital.

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:57.630
Naturally,
your contact with us decreased.

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:02.510
Lady Shen, do you know

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:04.800
what happened to my family

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:06.950
after they moved to the Capital?

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:21.750
We knew we were humble

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:23.920
and not a match for your family.

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:25.600
We thought that in a few years,

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:27.040
the engagement would be called off,

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:28.430
so we didn't want to disturb.

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:29.770
Later,

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:32.120
we heard that your family had trouble,

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:34.390
but we didn't dare to ask for details.

00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:36.550
If not for the current difficulties,

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:38.870
we wouldn't have come to trouble you.

00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:43.350
So,

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:45.550
after my family moved here,

00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:47.120
you lost contact with them,

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:49.390
and you knew nothing about them?

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:50.670
Yes, yes.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:53.030
Now that I've changed my name,

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:54.200
how did you all

00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:57.510
find me?

00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:12.750
Have you forgotten?

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:14.440
That day,

00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:17.740
when you took office
and inspected Juxian Alley,

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:19.870
we happened to be selling pancakes,

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:22.410
and we recognized you.

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:23.720
Yes, yes.

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:25.620
So many years apart didn't change

00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:27.420
the fact that we're in-laws.

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:30.380
I took a look and knew
you were my future son-in-law.

00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:31.780
Yes, yes.

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:33.380
I also recognized you.

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:35.020
I was too excited.

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:36.260
I lost my composure.

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:42.700
I have to go to court.

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:44.180
Take your time.

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:51.280
Vice Prefect, goodbye.

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:52.220
Goodbye, Vice Prefect.

00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:58.420
Dad, why haven't you stood up?

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:00.220
My legs are numb.

00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:01.660
I can't move.

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:08.060
(Clear and Bright)

00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:17.780
(Ancestor's Room)

00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:23.140
(Mom, Dad, Yangyang)

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:24.100
Everyone, well done.

00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:25.380
You got up early,

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:26.860
pretending to be inexperienced,

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:27.780
wandering around,

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:29.380
but actually surveying

00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:30.560
the terrain of Yunshui Manor.

00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:31.940
The covert operation was

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:32.940
very successful.

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:36.460
I really think that privy is nice.

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:41.700
We need to maintain
a style of bold analysis

00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:43.220
and careful verification,

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:45.030
trying to find a way
back to the modern era

00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:46.900
(Water Pavilion)
in Yunshui Manor.

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:47.740
Well said.

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:48.820
Next,

00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:52.420
I'll also give a constructive speech.

00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:53.820
To get to the bottom

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:54.860
of the truth,

00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:56.700
we need first to review

00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:58.460
what happened on the day we came here.

00:10:58.860 --> 00:10:59.980
According to Jicai,

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:01.980
she was chasing a guy

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:03.500
and walked into this corridor.

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:04.920
After going through the corridor,

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:06.540
(Back Door)
she came to the back door,

00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:07.420
opened the back door,

00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:08.660
and came to this era.

00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:10.780
If we go back the same way,

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:11.820
could we

00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:12.980
go back?

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:16.300
- That makes sense.
- That makes sense.

00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:24.100
Help!

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.700
(Langhuan Chamber, Back Door)

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:28.940
(Back Door)

00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:30.580
The place we were together

00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:32.460
before we came to this era was

00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:33.660
the ancestral hall.

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:35.240
So, should we go back there?

00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:36.740
We've been there.

00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:38.260
The ancestral hall

00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:40.900
(Langhuan Chamber)
is now this small study.

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:42.420
Your dad and I

00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:43.980
have been around this area this morning.

00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:45.060
This place

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:46.460
is well guarded.

00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:47.700
It's not easy

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:48.780
to get in.

00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:51.180
So, what do we do now?

00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:55.140
Why is no one speaking?

00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:56.580
Shen Jianshe, what's your name for?

00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:58.020
It's to give a constructive speech.

00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:02.940
I think

00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:04.860
since the ancestral hall

00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:05.940
is guarded,

00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:07.820
if we all go there,

00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:09.020
it's easy to be discovered.

00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:10.100
If we could

00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:11.100
send just one person,

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:12.780
the target would be smaller,

00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:14.940
and we could likely break
through the blockade.

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:25.140
What do you mean?

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:27.500
Me?

00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:29.100
No, no, no.

00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:30.220
I can't, I can't.

00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:31.380
I can't.

00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:32.620
I won't go.

00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:37.140
For fairness, how about we vote?

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:38.420
Let's vote.

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:41.380
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:45.460
Mom, they're playing tricks.

00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:46.600
They're bribing and cheating.

00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:48.580
Raise your hands to vote
for Shen Shaoguang.

00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:49.420
Yangyang.

00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:54.500
Look, three votes are for you.

00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:55.780
It's me again?

00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:56.820
Mom...

00:13:58.140 --> 00:13:58.980
Jicai,

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:00.460
it has to be you.

00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:02.660
In our family, you're the smartest

00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:03.900
and the most quick-witted.

00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:05.380
Look at your dad and your brother.

00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:06.740
Who can you rely on?

00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:08.180
- I...
- Right?

00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:12.740
Jicai.

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:14.020
Fine.

00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:24.020
Leave.

00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:25.060
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:36.780
Oh, no, Young Master,

00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:38.700
I just thought of something.

00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:39.620
The Shens

00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:41.180
recognized you by your appearance.

00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:42.940
Doesn't that mean someone else

00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:44.420
at the court might notice too?

00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:46.100
After so long in the Capital,

00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:47.460
you finally thought of that.

00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:50.460
Don't worry about that.

00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:51.820
Since I'm back,

00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:53.840
I never intended
to hide my identity forever.

00:14:56.140 --> 00:14:57.160
I found in the documents

00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:59.640
that this secret code is the numbers
used by Huoxun Kingdom,

00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:00.580
which correspond

00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:02.580
to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:04.340
These are numbers?

00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:05.840
These are notches.

00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:07.380
If we match the correct numbers

00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:08.800
to the notches, the lock will open.

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:10.100
Nine numbers.

00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:11.020
Eight holes.

00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:12.020
Altogether,

00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:13.840
tens of millions of possibilities.

00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:16.060
Tens of millions of possibilities?

00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:18.460
That means it's impossible
to figure it out, right?

00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:20.460
Young Master, this is too...

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:21.300
Quiet.

00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:28.140
Young Master,

00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:29.300
how about I do it?

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:31.460
Even if I don't eat
or drink in this life,

00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:33.180
don't get married or have children,

00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:34.720
I will try all these possibilities

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:36.160
to repay you.

00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:38.060
Quiet.

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:48.340
I remember now.

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:49.740
Your father once taught you

00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:50.900
how to open a lock by sound.

00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:52.580
I can have a daughter then.

00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:55.480
I think what I need to learn
is how to make a silencing potion.

00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:21.100
One, two, three.

00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:22.060
Four.

00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:23.020
Five.

00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:24.740
Two, two.

00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:26.700
Three, four.

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:27.660
Five.

00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:35.500
There's no one here.

00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:37.980
So lucky.

00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:40.020
Even the guards have left their posts?

00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:49.980
Someone's coming.

00:16:58.180 --> 00:17:00.100
The portrait of the ancestors

00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:01.580
used to be in here.

00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:15.580
(No wonder dramas
are always shot this way.)

00:17:15.820 --> 00:17:17.900
(So, ancient mechanisms
are really like this.)

00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:27.700
(No Visitors Allowed)

00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:28.900
(Private Area, Do Not Enter)

00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:42.940
(This lock is...)

00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:45.500
(It's here.)

00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:47.740
(Could it be that the time-space tunnel)

00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:49.900
(that can send us back is inside?)

00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:55.220
Eight, eight, eight.

00:17:59.060 --> 00:17:59.900
Eight.

00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:09.860
Eight, eight, eight.

00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:10.860
Eight, eight.

00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:13.980
Eight.

00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:33.660
She opened the lock

00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:36.300
so easily?

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:16.100
(Why haven't I gone back?)

00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:19.340
(But this is exactly the lock.)

00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:21.460
(It came with us.)

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:23.180
(I should be right.)

00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:24.860
(This house)

00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:26.700
(is the time-space tunnel connecting)

00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:27.800
(the past and the future.)

00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:30.340
(We can definitely go home
through here.)

00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:37.220
Vice Prefect.

00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:40.100
What are you doing?

00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:43.820
I...

00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:46.260
I accidentally got lost,

00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:49.100
accidentally walked into the study,

00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:51.220
accidentally came to this room,

00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:53.700
accidentally opened the lock,

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:55.460
and came in.

00:19:58.180 --> 00:19:59.340
Accidentally?

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:13.620
This lock has numbers
from Huoxun Kingdom.

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:15.980
Ordinary people
don't recognize them at all.

00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:18.660
Yet you opened it.

00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:21.140
How could you have done it accidentally?

00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:23.140
I don't know the Huoxun Kingdom

00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:25.140
you're talking about,

00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:28.420
but I do recognize these numbers.

00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:30.100
We used to be in business,

00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:31.180
running a diner.

00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:32.020
We don't know much,

00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:33.940
but we're familiar with numbers. Look.

00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:37.700
Eight, eight, eight, eight,
eight, eight, eight, eight.

00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:38.780
It implies great wealth.

00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:40.900
It means prosperity and making money.

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:43.460
That's too easy to guess

00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:44.520
for people in business.

00:20:58.140 --> 00:20:59.220
(Tai Xuan Jing)

00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:08.820
Young Master,

00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:10.340
she just got away...?

00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:11.180
She won't.

00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:13.800
Without the cooperation of many parties,

00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:14.900
it would've been impossible

00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:16.580
to frame my father without any flaws.

00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:19.100
My family was exterminated.

00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:21.580
How could the Shens,
related to us by engagement,

00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:23.260
have been spared?

00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:25.100
Could it be

00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:28.300
that they were just impostors all along?

00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:30.860
And you were engaged

00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:32.100
to someone else?

00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:34.420
Or perhaps

00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:36.300
she's indeed my fiancée,

00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:37.740
but they sought protection

00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:39.420
and pledged allegiance to someone.

00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:41.300
They're likely spies.

00:21:42.050 --> 00:21:43.180
That would explain

00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:44.780
why this woman knows

00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:45.940
Huoxun Kingdom's numbers.

00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:46.980
I don't even know them.

00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:50.020
They might have been trained
in the Western Regions.

00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:51.320
What should we do next?

00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:52.580
Should we bring them back

00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:53.600
and torture them for info?

00:21:56.540 --> 00:21:58.020
The lock on the Langhuan Chamber door

00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:00.560
is confirmed to be the same lock
as the one from the back door

00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:02.600
of Yunshui Manor
when we came to this era.

00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:04.100
Good.

00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:05.780
That's settled then.

00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:07.660
Since modern items have appeared,

00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:09.460
Yunshui Manor must definitely be

00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:10.340
a time-space tunnel.

00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:11.180
Absolutely.

00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:13.580
But now, Vice Prefect Lin

00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:15.620
is already suspicious of us.

00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:17.740
I think this is a bit troublesome.

00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:19.460
But he's an official.

00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:20.340
He probably can't

00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:21.420
lay a hand on us directly.

00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:22.900
We still have some time.

00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:23.900
That makes sense.

00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:25.900
Before our ancestor reacts,

00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:27.900
let's make a quick getaway.

00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:30.460
I think we should do this:

00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:31.740
Let's recall the details

00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:33.860
of that day again.

00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:35.420
What else happened

00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:36.660
when we went to Yunshui Manor?

00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:38.380
For example, what we touched

00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:39.220
and what we said.

00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:41.140
We can't overlook any detail.

00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:42.300
Maybe

00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:43.740
if we recreate

00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:44.840
the situation of that day,

00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:46.420
it might work.

00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:47.540
Grandma,

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:49.520
when I time-traveled,

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:50.460
I didn't do my homework.

00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:52.340
Does that mean
if I never do my homework,

00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:53.380
I can time-travel back?

00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:54.820
You...

00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:57.100
You just don't want to do your homework,

00:22:57.100 --> 00:22:57.940
right?

00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:28.940
Liu Chang.

00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:33.420
In the spring of Tianxing Year 22,

00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:34.900
I met Fifth Master Xiao.

00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:37.180
He always carried
writing paper with him,

00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:40.220
and I followed his example
and wrote this note.

00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:42.540
This is Father's note.

00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:46.140
Right, Gongcai.

00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:48.300
When you time-traveled that day,

00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:49.980
I remember
you were wearing thong sandals,

00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:51.680
and you hadn't cut your toenails.

00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:53.620
But when you tried
to time-travel that day,

00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:54.980
you weren't wearing thong sandals,

00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:56.700
and you still hadn't cut your toenails.

00:23:57.900 --> 00:23:58.800
Come on, Dad.

00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:00.340
Does that have anything to do with it?

00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:01.540
Thong sandals, toenails?

00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:03.060
Do they have that much energy

00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:04.300
to affect time-travel?

00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:07.300
I'll think about it again.

00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:09.340
I'll look for reasons

00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:10.420
from myself.

00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:23.340
What are you doing?

00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:25.220
I remember.

00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:27.940
Weren't we in the ancestral hall
at that time?

00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:29.700
Didn't we all worship

00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:30.920
the portrait of our ancestors,

00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:32.180
hoping for their blessings?

00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:33.060
Yes, yes.

00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:34.220
Maybe this time,

00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:35.380
if we worship

00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:36.780
the real person,

00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:38.380
we can go back.

00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:42.100
Wait.

00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:43.980
I think he has a point.

00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:45.220
If we can

00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:46.260
worship the real person

00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:47.460
and make this event

00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:48.540
more grand and solemn,

00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:50.020
we will definitely be able

00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:51.740
to time-travel back.

00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:53.860
That makes sense.

00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:57.660
In Tianxing Year 23,

00:24:58.740 --> 00:24:59.580
Che

00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:01.620
grew a bit taller.

00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:05.140
Tianxing Year 26...

00:25:05.950 --> 00:25:07.320
It was the year Father was framed.

00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:09.200
(How could he become
the Vice Minister of War?)

00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:10.660
He discovered on March 26

00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:12.460
that someone
was selling official positions,

00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:14.640
and their hands had even reached
the Ministry of War.

00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:24.120
Father found out that someone

00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:26.220
was manipulating the appointments,

00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:29.720
which is why he sent Mother and me

00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:31.720
back to our hometown in Qingyang in May.

00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:33.540
He sensed

00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:35.380
that something would happen to him,

00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:39.780
thinking that he could protect
the family this way.

00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:42.620
But the mastermind behind it all

00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:43.940
pinned everything on him.

00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:45.740
Father

00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:48.300
died in prison,

00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:50.980
my family was exterminated,

00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:54.220
and our property was confiscated.

00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:14.660
This note is useless,

00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:17.100
even if it's presented in court.

00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:19.340
To overturn the case,

00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:21.540
we must find more evidence.

00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:31.300
(It seems we haven't gone back.)

00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:32.860
(What's going on?)

00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:34.500
(Did we go back?)

00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:36.380
(I don't know.)

00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:38.700
Jicai.

00:27:39.170 --> 00:27:40.840
- Do you think...?
- What are you doing?

00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:51.380
Don't be afraid.

00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:52.540
Don't be afraid, Yangyang.

00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:47.060
Lady Shen, please.

00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:08.380
Vice Prefect.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.000
What happened last night
was a misunderstanding.

00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:12.220
I can explain.

00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:48.060
Last night,

00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:51.180
your whole family sneaked into my room,

00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:53.900
intending to harm me.

00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:55.860
No, absolutely not.

00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:56.740
You've misunderstood.

00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:01.580
Misunderstood?

00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:03.580
We sneaked into your room

00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:12.220
to pray for your blessings.

00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:23.900
Pray?

00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:26.500
Our grandfather once told us a method:

00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:27.900
If we wash our hands, burn incense,

00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:28.940
offer holy items,

00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:30.060
scatter flower petals,

00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:32.060
and bow three times to the person

00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:33.140
we deeply admire,

00:30:33.380 --> 00:30:34.660
we can pray for their blessings.

00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:37.100
We've been living
at your house for free,

00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:38.460
and we feel really bad about it,

00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:40.420
so we held this ceremony

00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:43.780
to pray

00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:46.700
for your good fortune and long life.

00:30:56.260 --> 00:30:57.100
Actually,

00:30:58.060 --> 00:30:58.940
Lady Shen,

00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:01.220
you are not the lady

00:31:01.220 --> 00:31:02.540
who was engaged to me,

00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:04.100
are you?

00:31:16.380 --> 00:31:17.620
That secret code lock

00:31:18.340 --> 00:31:19.780
can't be solved

00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:21.140
just by guessing.

00:31:22.020 --> 00:31:23.220
How could you know

00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:24.180
what the code is?

00:31:25.980 --> 00:31:27.260
Why don't you be more honest?

00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:30.220
What are you really after?

00:31:32.540 --> 00:31:33.380
Tell me.

00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:35.940
Maybe I can help you.

00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:54.500
Do you have to bully me like this?

00:31:54.820 --> 00:31:55.660
I...

00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:57.260
In the old days in Qingyang,

00:31:57.260 --> 00:31:58.900
you used to be so upright

00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:00.140
and righteous.

00:32:00.380 --> 00:32:03.300
We think you'd never turn a blind eye
to friends in trouble.

00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:06.220
I know it's not easy for you,

00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:08.500
and we can't help you,

00:32:10.290 --> 00:32:12.660
but we still hope for a bit of kindness.

00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:16.380
Yet you want to deny my identity

00:32:16.620 --> 00:32:18.420
and completely shirk responsibility.

00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:22.660
We just don't deserve it.

00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:25.420
We will leave on our own.

00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:32.380
I...

00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:34.940
I...

00:32:38.860 --> 00:32:39.900
I didn't mean that.

00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:41.420
You...

00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:43.860
Please don't cry.

00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:49.380
(It seems shedding tears on the spot)

00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:51.580
(is also useful in ancient times.)

00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:54.820
If you want me to leave,

00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:57.380
I will definitely leave with my family.

00:32:58.060 --> 00:32:59.420
Just say the word.

00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:04.660
I didn't mean it that way.

00:33:05.220 --> 00:33:06.060
It's just

00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:07.700
that I don't quite remember how it was

00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:09.100
with your family when I was a child,

00:33:09.820 --> 00:33:11.220
so I need to confirm with you.

00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:13.940
I understand.

00:33:15.620 --> 00:33:17.140
You've been through a lot.

00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:19.140
It's hard to trust others.

00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:21.300
It's okay.

00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:23.340
If you have any questions,

00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:24.300
just ask us.

00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:26.100
Time will tell.

00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:27.540
You'll eventually know

00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:28.620
what kind of people we are.

00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:41.260
I...

00:33:43.420 --> 00:33:45.140
What are you going to say?

00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:47.980
You have a question so soon?

00:33:52.180 --> 00:33:53.260
I was wondering

00:33:54.340 --> 00:33:55.180
if you'd like

00:33:59.380 --> 00:34:00.540
to have some tea.
