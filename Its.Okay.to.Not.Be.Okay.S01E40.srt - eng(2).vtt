WEBVTT

00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:03.211
I need to deal with
my alcohol problem first.

00:00:03.294 --> 00:00:05.839
I'll get better.
I'll finish my treatment.

00:00:05.922 --> 00:00:08.550
If you're willing to wait,
I'll take care of you for life.

00:00:08.633 --> 00:00:09.426
Nurse Patty!

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:11.261
It's about Patrick and Miss Mia.

00:00:11.344 --> 00:00:13.680
I overheard Kai…
Miss Mia's his girlfriend!

00:00:13.763 --> 00:00:16.057
Patrick and Mia
stayed overnight there, too.

00:00:16.141 --> 00:00:17.267
Liar!

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:19.310
You don't want to be
around Matmat anymore!

00:00:19.394 --> 00:00:20.395
That's not true.

00:00:20.478 --> 00:00:22.188
You told Mama

00:00:22.272 --> 00:00:25.108
you wanted me dead!

00:00:25.191 --> 00:00:27.819
You told her, "I hope my brother dies!"

00:00:27.902 --> 00:00:29.320
I hate you!

00:01:48.483 --> 00:01:49.400
Patrick…

00:01:59.077 --> 00:02:00.161
Patrick…

00:02:11.631 --> 00:02:13.716
I can't drive you to your house.

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:19.305
I need to be with Matmat.

00:02:20.098 --> 00:02:21.307
Patrick.

00:02:21.391 --> 00:02:23.726
Doc Anok has advised
you shouldn't see him just yet.

00:02:26.104 --> 00:02:27.272
Patrick.

00:02:27.647 --> 00:02:28.731
Patrick!

00:02:33.903 --> 00:02:35.655
You did nothing wrong.

00:02:39.534 --> 00:02:40.952
I have to see Matmat.

00:02:48.793 --> 00:02:52.005
{\an8}

00:02:52.088 --> 00:02:58.720
{\an8}

00:03:10.648 --> 00:03:13.568
{\an8}He won't wake up for
a while after the shot we gave him.

00:03:15.111 --> 00:03:16.529
{\an8}You should go home and rest.

00:03:18.364 --> 00:03:20.241
{\an8}I can't leave Matmat.

00:03:20.325 --> 00:03:23.161
{\an8}

00:03:23.244 --> 00:03:25.330
{\an8}Patrick, you need to rest.

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:29.125
{\an8}You need to compose yourself
before you see Matmat again.

00:03:31.836 --> 00:03:34.464
{\an8}Go home. I'll call you once he's awake.

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.053
{\an8}He's got a gentle face,
but he's really nasty inside.

00:03:40.136 --> 00:03:42.597
{\an8}Zelda, the nurses might hear you.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.974
{\an8}Zelda's actually right. I saw it.

00:03:45.058 --> 00:03:48.645
{\an8}The look in Patrick's
eyes completely changed.

00:03:48.728 --> 00:03:49.646
{\an8}Right?

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:51.773
{\an8}- I thought no one noticed it.
I saw it, too.

00:03:51.856 --> 00:03:55.360
{\an8}How does
he have the nerve to act like that

00:03:55.443 --> 00:03:58.488
{\an8}when he lies to his own brother?

00:03:58.571 --> 00:04:01.699
{\an8}The truth really has
a way of ruining things.

00:04:01.783 --> 00:04:03.868
Patrick has no respect!

00:04:03.952 --> 00:04:05.620
You really can't trust anyone.

00:04:05.703 --> 00:04:08.289
Those pretty boys hide evil so well!

00:04:11.125 --> 00:04:12.627
{\an8}Don't you dare badmouth Patrick!

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:15.713
{\an8}- Stop, Kai.
You don't even know him!

00:04:15.797 --> 00:04:17.257
{\an8}We know him!

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:18.633
{\an8}No, you don't!

00:04:18.716 --> 00:04:20.802
{\an8}- You don't know Patrick!
Come on now.

00:04:20.885 --> 00:04:23.054
{\an8}Don't judge him
when you don't know him!

00:04:23.137 --> 00:04:24.931
{\an8}- You're nothing but gossips!
See what he did?!

00:04:25.014 --> 00:04:26.933
{\an8}- That's enough.

00:04:27.016 --> 00:04:28.059
{\an8}Nurse, look!

00:04:29.519 --> 00:04:31.145
{\an8}- Gossips!

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:32.730
{\an8}- Smell it!
No!

00:04:32.814 --> 00:04:36.234
{\an8}Geez! This is what
we get for stepping in?

00:04:36.317 --> 00:04:40.029
{\an8}Rather than being pissed off,
just figure out why Kai reacted that way.

00:04:40.113 --> 00:04:41.364
{\an8}Okay.

00:04:41.447 --> 00:04:44.284
Apparently, the patients were
saying bad things about Patrick,

00:04:44.367 --> 00:04:45.827
that's why Kai got mad.

00:04:47.912 --> 00:04:49.289
Ma'am Olivia.

00:04:50.873 --> 00:04:53.626
I already talked to Miss Zelda.
I told her you'd be speaking with her.

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:55.461
Okay, let's have a meeting.

00:04:55.545 --> 00:04:56.796
May I ask why?

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:59.173
Did something change
in patient Zelda's routine?

00:04:59.257 --> 00:05:00.925
We're
treating her for depression,

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:03.052
but I've noticed some
changes in her behavior.

00:05:03.136 --> 00:05:07.515
So I'd like to talk to her first
before consulting Dr. Emman.

00:05:08.975 --> 00:05:10.768
Can I say something.

00:05:10.852 --> 00:05:13.146
She's been our patient for a long time.

00:05:13.938 --> 00:05:16.399
But she's still a mystery to me.

00:05:18.026 --> 00:05:19.944
From what I know,

00:05:20.028 --> 00:05:22.488
she no longer has family in the country.

00:05:22.572 --> 00:05:25.992
It's her sibling in Italy
who supports her treatment.

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:30.538
May I ask what caused her depression?

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:35.418
Seems like it started after
her and her husband's separation,

00:05:35.501 --> 00:05:38.379
but she hasn't shared anything with me.

00:05:38.463 --> 00:05:41.674
Anyway, have
you talked to Patrick? How is he?

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:45.928
Not yet, ma'am.

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:50.808
He probably needs more time.

00:05:54.187 --> 00:05:57.607
Anyway, let's start our meeting.
I'll just get my logbook.

00:05:59.984 --> 00:06:02.570
Haven't you really
checked on Patrick yet?

00:06:05.073 --> 00:06:06.491
Patty,

00:06:06.574 --> 00:06:09.577
he and Matmat are
dealing with a lot right now.

00:06:10.745 --> 00:06:12.663
I have to give them space.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.124
Is that so?

00:07:23.651 --> 00:07:25.403
What happened?

00:07:31.075 --> 00:07:33.744
We were happy earlier.

00:07:41.919 --> 00:07:45.840
Matmat burst into tears recalling
how he almost drowned in the river.

00:07:51.721 --> 00:07:54.515
But why does it feel like it's my fault?

00:08:00.897 --> 00:08:03.316
Talk to your siblings.

00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:08.321
So they can patch things up.

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:13.618
And so they can finally come home.

00:08:36.891 --> 00:08:40.603
So, tell Mama that Patrick
and Matmat aren't having dinner there.

00:08:41.896 --> 00:08:42.897
Ah…

00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:44.565
Okay. Noted, sis.

00:08:44.649 --> 00:08:47.193
Besides,
Miss Li heard what you just said.

00:08:47.276 --> 00:08:49.237
- Right, Miss Li?
- Yes. Go on.

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:50.780
I have something to tell her.

00:08:50.863 --> 00:08:52.406
Uh, my pretty love…

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:55.535
I'm coming over tomorrow,
okay? My brothers need me.

00:08:55.618 --> 00:08:57.620
Hmph. Delusional.

00:08:58.371 --> 00:08:59.997
Alright, Jason.

00:09:00.081 --> 00:09:02.708
You might help cheer up Matmat.

00:09:03.584 --> 00:09:05.503
Alright. I've got to get back to work.

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:07.713
- Okay. Thanks, sis! Bye!
- Gemma, is Mia--

00:09:08.631 --> 00:09:11.467
Hey. Why didn't you ask where Mia is?!

00:09:12.802 --> 00:09:17.014
Well, Boss V,
if Miss Mia's at the hospital,

00:09:17.098 --> 00:09:19.809
Gemma would've
mentioned her earlier in the call.

00:09:19.892 --> 00:09:21.602
But she didn't.

00:09:21.686 --> 00:09:24.438
And we kept calling Miss Mia,
but she wasn't picking up.

00:09:24.522 --> 00:09:26.023
That means Miss Mia has gone missing.

00:09:26.107 --> 00:09:27.358
- But she is--
- Madeth!

00:09:27.441 --> 00:09:28.526
Mia really is missing.

00:09:28.609 --> 00:09:30.111
That's why we're
searching for her, right?!

00:09:30.194 --> 00:09:32.613
Are we just going
to wait for her to come back?!

00:09:32.697 --> 00:09:36.576
Hmph! Mia's in serious trouble
again because of that annoying Patrick!

00:09:36.659 --> 00:09:37.702
Psst!

00:09:37.785 --> 00:09:39.579
You're being too mean to Patrick.

00:09:40.079 --> 00:09:42.081
Why? I'm telling the truth!

00:09:42.164 --> 00:09:45.543
If Patrick hadn't invited Mia,
Matmat wouldn't have gotten mad at her!

00:09:45.626 --> 00:09:47.920
Psst. You know what? Listen to me!

00:09:48.004 --> 00:09:49.714
No matter how many
times Patrick invited Mia,

00:09:49.797 --> 00:09:52.049
if she had just said no,
we wouldn't have this problem!

00:09:52.133 --> 00:09:54.260
There's nothing we can do.
Mia's madly in love with him!

00:09:54.343 --> 00:09:57.221
Don't say things like that about Mia!

00:09:57.305 --> 00:09:59.056
Patrick's taking advantage of Mia!

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:01.434
Patrick isn't like that!
Mia's the one to blame!

00:10:01.517 --> 00:10:03.102
Our life was
peaceful before she got here!

00:10:03.185 --> 00:10:06.147
- Our life was peaceful before Patrick--
- Miss Li, Vincent and Jason are fighting!

00:10:08.357 --> 00:10:10.234
Is there a problem?

00:10:12.486 --> 00:10:14.238
Bro. Bro, I like your cut.

00:10:14.322 --> 00:10:16.824
- It's nice. You look so fine.
- Thanks to you.

00:10:16.907 --> 00:10:18.159
I also like your blue top.

00:10:18.242 --> 00:10:19.744
- Thanks.
- I like it.

00:10:19.827 --> 00:10:21.454
We're not fighting. Uh…

00:10:21.537 --> 00:10:23.748
I was just checking
out Jason's nice polo shirt.

00:10:31.922 --> 00:10:33.549
Nurse.

00:10:33.633 --> 00:10:35.343
Get straight to the point.

00:10:36.218 --> 00:10:38.054
What do you need?

00:10:39.513 --> 00:10:43.726
I just need to know what you're feeling.

00:10:46.103 --> 00:10:47.897
Well, the truth is…

00:10:48.939 --> 00:10:51.317
Something's been bothering me.

00:10:54.987 --> 00:10:59.617
Is it true
that someone tried to kill him?

00:11:02.286 --> 00:11:04.121
Who almost got killed?

00:11:04.914 --> 00:11:06.332
Matmat.

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:12.088
Is it true his brother
wanted him dead before?

00:11:13.589 --> 00:11:15.007
Ah…

00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:19.595
Whatever happened to Matmat in the past…

00:11:19.678 --> 00:11:20.888
Mm-hmm.

00:11:20.971 --> 00:11:24.350
…it seems like it was just
a simple fight with his brother.

00:11:25.101 --> 00:11:26.602
A misunderstanding.

00:11:27.395 --> 00:11:30.564
Misunderstanding?

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:38.531
Do you think that's funny?

00:11:39.949 --> 00:11:41.367
Did you know…

00:11:42.201 --> 00:11:43.744
In Otero's book,

00:11:43.828 --> 00:11:47.206
he killed his wife because
he thought she was having an affair.

00:11:47.289 --> 00:11:49.208
And in The Great Gatsby,

00:11:49.291 --> 00:11:51.836
George killed Gatsby,

00:11:51.919 --> 00:11:54.463
even though Gatsby
didn't do anything wrong.

00:11:55.423 --> 00:11:56.048
Mm!

00:11:59.677 --> 00:12:03.097
Do you think that way
because of the books you're reading?

00:12:04.223 --> 00:12:08.102
But it can happen in
real life. Right, Nurse?

00:12:11.605 --> 00:12:16.318
So, Nurse, you shouldn't
take a misunderstanding lightly.

00:12:18.737 --> 00:12:25.744
A simple misunderstanding
could cost someone their life.

00:13:17.379 --> 00:13:18.797
It's getting late.

00:13:19.798 --> 00:13:21.550
Aren't you going home?

00:13:28.599 --> 00:13:31.185
I'll just wait for Matmat
to get out of the isolation room.

00:13:38.901 --> 00:13:41.612
Aren't you going to go see him?

00:13:47.785 --> 00:13:49.787
He needs some space.

00:13:54.708 --> 00:13:56.126
Alright.

00:13:56.210 --> 00:13:57.962
I'll go back to work.

00:14:11.517 --> 00:14:14.937
He said he'll go
home once Matmat comes out.

00:14:16.689 --> 00:14:19.400
What if Matmat doesn't come out?

00:14:19.984 --> 00:14:21.652
Patrick really won't go home?

00:14:28.492 --> 00:14:29.827
Pogi.

00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:31.912
Matmat has autism.

00:14:33.914 --> 00:14:35.374
People like him,

00:14:36.792 --> 00:14:44.008
shut themselves off from the world,
when they're struggling, overwhelmed,

00:14:44.091 --> 00:14:46.510
or dealing with
emotions they can't explain.

00:14:48.596 --> 00:14:50.931
We shouldn't pressure
them to be okay because

00:14:51.015 --> 00:14:53.601
they should be the ones
to say when they're ready.

00:14:54.602 --> 00:14:56.061
That's why Patrick

00:14:57.187 --> 00:14:59.273
has gotten used to waiting for Matmat.

00:15:01.066 --> 00:15:04.945
He will wait no matter how long it takes.

00:15:06.238 --> 00:15:09.366
Because that's how
he shows his love for his brother.

00:15:13.329 --> 00:15:14.747
Doc Anok?

00:15:15.456 --> 00:15:16.582
Li?

00:15:17.041 --> 00:15:18.667
- Doc Anok.
- Li? Li!

00:15:19.627 --> 00:15:21.795
- Here.
- Ooh!

00:15:21.879 --> 00:15:23.297
Time for your snack.

00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:25.174
Just stay there. I got this.

00:15:25.257 --> 00:15:27.509
Sit down. Just sit there.

00:15:27.593 --> 00:15:29.929
- Here.
- Ah…

00:15:30.012 --> 00:15:31.013
There you go.

00:15:31.096 --> 00:15:34.141
Wow. You're so sweet.

00:15:34.224 --> 00:15:37.311
You came here just to bring me a snack.

00:15:37.394 --> 00:15:39.146
Don't be silly.

00:15:39.229 --> 00:15:42.191
I came back here
because I couldn't help but ask

00:15:42.274 --> 00:15:44.109
about what happened between those two.

00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:46.695
So, how are they?

00:15:50.115 --> 00:15:52.284
Life is testing them right now.

00:15:53.535 --> 00:15:54.620
My goodness.

00:15:54.703 --> 00:15:57.122
First they lost their mom,

00:15:57.206 --> 00:16:01.168
now they're facing all these challenges.

00:16:01.627 --> 00:16:03.921
Mm-hmm. First, the PTSD diagnosis.

00:16:05.005 --> 00:16:07.257
Then, Matmat's
trauma from the river incident.

00:16:09.093 --> 00:16:12.596
But Doc Anok, this is different.

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:16.433
I'm sure Matmat is
struggling to process this.

00:16:16.517 --> 00:16:21.021
Imagine, he thinks
his own brother wanted him dead.

00:16:21.105 --> 00:16:23.190
He's been carrying that for so long.

00:16:23.273 --> 00:16:25.859
I'm sure this is
hard for Patrick as well.

00:16:25.943 --> 00:16:29.446
He won't stop until
his brother forgives him.

00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:34.576
And we don't know if
Matmat will ever forgive him.

00:16:35.619 --> 00:16:41.417
But there is something
Patrick must do that is much harder.

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:43.919
What?

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:48.215
He needs
to forgive himself first.

00:16:48.298 --> 00:16:51.677
Because no matter how
many times he apologizes to Matmat,

00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:54.638
if he hasn't forgiven himself,

00:16:54.722 --> 00:16:57.933
the weight of their past
will burden him forever.

00:17:11.655 --> 00:17:13.407
Here.

00:17:14.241 --> 00:17:16.410
You ignored what I said.

00:17:18.996 --> 00:17:21.081
Sorry, Doc. I couldn't leave Matmat.

00:17:22.916 --> 00:17:24.334
How are you?

00:17:26.879 --> 00:17:29.256
How do you feel
about everything going on?

00:17:31.133 --> 00:17:32.634
I don't know, Doc.

00:17:33.385 --> 00:17:35.471
I never thought it would come to this.

00:17:36.722 --> 00:17:37.931
What do you mean?

00:17:38.891 --> 00:17:40.934
That your brother would get mad

00:17:41.018 --> 00:17:43.353
at something you did when you were kids?

00:17:45.105 --> 00:17:47.816
He never mentioned it before.

00:17:48.817 --> 00:17:50.986
You've been taking
care of Matmat for so long.

00:17:51.487 --> 00:17:55.491
You should know that people with autism
often have excellent memory.

00:17:56.158 --> 00:17:58.786
It seems that you're
the one who wants to forget.

00:18:04.917 --> 00:18:07.461
You and your brother
have gone through so much.

00:18:08.754 --> 00:18:11.757
Your past resurfacing is just
another challenge for you both.

00:18:12.841 --> 00:18:14.968
But you can overcome this.

00:18:15.052 --> 00:18:17.096
As long as you're there for each other.

00:18:19.973 --> 00:18:21.809
But didn't you hear what he said?

00:18:21.892 --> 00:18:23.352
He doesn't want me around anymore.

00:18:24.186 --> 00:18:26.355
I highly doubt that.

00:18:26.438 --> 00:18:28.023
But if that's the case,

00:18:28.107 --> 00:18:29.191
will you just abandon him?

00:18:32.694 --> 00:18:34.738
Since you also rely on Matmat,

00:18:35.781 --> 00:18:38.534
give him a chance to help you.

00:18:39.326 --> 00:18:40.744
Face this together.

00:18:44.832 --> 00:18:48.961
Will seeing the butterflies
affect his therapy progress?

00:18:49.044 --> 00:18:52.464
The emotions he showed
aren't connected to the butterflies.

00:18:52.548 --> 00:18:54.216
We need to observe him more.

00:18:57.553 --> 00:18:59.012
Alright.

00:18:59.096 --> 00:19:01.098
You can go back to work.

00:19:02.641 --> 00:19:08.230
I took care of Bella's
dad's complaint against you.

00:19:08.939 --> 00:19:10.107
What did you do?

00:19:10.607 --> 00:19:12.860
I talked to him, of course.

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:17.197
Since you're always at the hospital,
you may as well work.

00:19:17.281 --> 00:19:21.535
Once Matmat is okay, you can go home.

00:19:22.744 --> 00:19:24.872
Thank you, Doc.

00:19:24.955 --> 00:19:26.874
Your phone keeps ringing.

00:19:26.957 --> 00:19:28.584
Should I pick it up for you?

00:19:34.756 --> 00:19:35.799
Hello?

00:19:36.508 --> 00:19:38.552
Bro, remember me?

00:19:58.363 --> 00:19:59.448
Matmat?

00:20:02.993 --> 00:20:04.077
Matmat?

00:20:04.995 --> 00:20:06.997
You can hear me, right?

00:20:13.545 --> 00:20:15.797
Is it not too hot under there?

00:20:23.055 --> 00:20:24.806
Let's eat, Matmat.

00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:26.350
Aren't you hungry?

00:20:31.271 --> 00:20:33.315
Are you not hungry or

00:20:33.398 --> 00:20:35.817
are you just trying to avoid Patrick?

00:20:41.031 --> 00:20:43.158
Patrick's not outside.

00:20:43.242 --> 00:20:44.660
Come, let's eat.

00:20:52.042 --> 00:20:54.336
I'll be at the nurse station, okay?

00:20:54.419 --> 00:20:56.755
If you need company,
you know where to find me.

00:21:22.447 --> 00:21:25.826
Gemma took forever to leave!

00:21:25.909 --> 00:21:28.370
She kept talking.

00:21:28.453 --> 00:21:31.790
Matmat was so hot underneath.

00:21:31.873 --> 00:21:33.125
Hmph!

00:21:56.648 --> 00:21:58.608
Patpat is not here.

00:21:58.692 --> 00:22:00.235
Patpat's not here.

00:22:06.491 --> 00:22:08.869
Good morning, bro.

00:22:10.495 --> 00:22:13.623
I brought you chicken barbeque.
To remind you of what it tastes like.

00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:17.210
I haven't been gone that long.

00:22:18.795 --> 00:22:23.508
One day, six hours and seven minutes,
feels like forever to me.

00:22:38.565 --> 00:22:41.026
Where's Matmat?

00:22:43.153 --> 00:22:44.696
Still in isolation?

00:22:51.286 --> 00:22:52.579
He still won't come out?

00:22:54.289 --> 00:22:55.832
We haven't talked yet.

00:22:59.711 --> 00:23:02.714
If he doesn't want
to come out, it just means…

00:23:04.299 --> 00:23:06.051
he's not ready to talk to me.

00:23:06.134 --> 00:23:07.135
Patrick.

00:23:09.221 --> 00:23:11.181
None of this would've happened

00:23:11.807 --> 00:23:13.767
if you hadn't gotten close with Mia.

00:23:17.312 --> 00:23:18.271
Bro.

00:23:18.939 --> 00:23:21.483
Take a look at your palm.

00:23:24.486 --> 00:23:28.031
It might just remind you
why you shouldn't be with Mia.

00:23:31.785 --> 00:23:33.036
I know that.

00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:40.502
It was just a dream.

00:23:43.213 --> 00:23:44.840
And in that dream,

00:23:46.299 --> 00:23:47.801
I was happy.

00:23:52.848 --> 00:23:54.558
I was free from everything.

00:24:18.707 --> 00:24:20.208
But now I'm awake.

00:24:26.089 --> 00:24:27.299
I'm awake.

00:24:41.479 --> 00:24:43.190
I'm back to reality now.

00:24:53.491 --> 00:24:55.076
Patpat and Matmat
should be together forever.

00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:56.494
I will make Patrick happy.

00:24:56.578 --> 00:24:59.706
Because you told me
to not burden myself with regret.

00:24:59.789 --> 00:25:01.208
You want to be with Miss Mia!

00:25:01.291 --> 00:25:02.417
That's not true.

00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:05.337
You want Matmat dead!

00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:06.922
Do you think he
still wants to be with you?

00:25:07.005 --> 00:25:08.840
I didn't realize I was hurting Matmat.

00:25:08.924 --> 00:25:10.759
It was a mistake I ever
entertained having you in my life

00:25:10.842 --> 00:25:13.053
When I'm with you,
it's like he doesn't exist.

00:25:13.136 --> 00:25:15.847
What about when you said
you were free because of me?

00:25:15.931 --> 00:25:17.474
This is where it ends for us.

00:25:18.642 --> 00:25:22.479
If we want happiness around us,
it has start from within.

00:25:22.562 --> 00:25:25.732
I really, really miss you, Patrick.

00:25:25.815 --> 00:25:28.068
There's something odd about her.

00:25:28.151 --> 00:25:30.362
I-It's a dinosaur!

00:25:30.445 --> 00:25:34.449
It's her birthday tomorrow.
You can't leave Mia.

00:25:34.532 --> 00:25:37.994
And we need to keep
her from thinking about her mom.

00:25:38.536 --> 00:25:39.746
Did she tell you anything?

00:25:39.829 --> 00:25:42.499
I remember her saying
today's an important day for her.

00:25:42.582 --> 00:25:44.834
I wouldn't be surprised
if she turns out to be Ingrid.

00:25:44.918 --> 00:25:46.503
That she's returned for
her husband and daughter.

00:25:46.586 --> 00:25:48.505
She must die!

00:25:48.588 --> 00:25:50.382
They're monsters!

00:25:50.799 --> 00:25:52.884
Your daughter's not a monster!
Mia isn't like that at all!

00:25:53.343 --> 00:25:56.846
You have to kill
her before she kills you!
