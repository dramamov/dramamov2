00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:02.752
Patrick, let's have a baby!

00:00:02.836 --> 00:00:04.963
You're too loud. It's embarrassing.

00:00:05.046 --> 00:00:06.923
- Patpat?
- I'll take it.

00:00:07.007 --> 00:00:09.050
What are you going to do?
Are you going to talk?

00:00:09.134 --> 00:00:10.552
Hello, pretty boy.

00:00:10.635 --> 00:00:13.012
Wine, cheese, and more.

00:00:13.096 --> 00:00:16.141
I'm so, so happy

00:00:16.224 --> 00:00:19.352
that you and Matmat
are living here with me.

00:00:19.894 --> 00:00:23.898
Do you think you can
face your fear of butterflies?

00:00:23.982 --> 00:00:25.442
She isn't just here for Mia.

00:00:25.525 --> 00:00:27.360
Everything was from Ingrid.

00:00:27.444 --> 00:00:29.404
She's alive, Patrick.

00:00:29.487 --> 00:00:32.032
And if there's one thing I know for sure,

00:00:32.115 --> 00:00:34.868
she's right here, inside the hospital.

00:01:35.637 --> 00:01:37.347
I received
some letters out of nowhere,

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.766
with instructions
to give them to someone.

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:41.976
Everything was from Ingrid.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.521
And she's alive, Patrick.

00:01:45.146 --> 00:01:47.774
And she's right here, inside the hospital.

00:01:49.192 --> 00:01:51.194
Patpat, the fried rice.

00:01:51.277 --> 00:01:55.448
The fried rice. You're going to burn it.

00:01:56.199 --> 00:01:58.284
It's just toasted a bit.

00:01:58.368 --> 00:01:59.661
It's good to go.

00:02:02.455 --> 00:02:06.376
Why are your eyes red?

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:09.170
Were you not able to sleep?

00:02:10.046 --> 00:02:11.756
I had enough sleep, Matmat.

00:02:12.507 --> 00:02:13.967
Maybe something just got into my eye.

00:02:21.307 --> 00:02:23.101
You have a session with Doc Anok, right?

00:02:23.184 --> 00:02:24.102
Hmm?

00:02:25.937 --> 00:02:27.147
Mm-hmm.

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.986
Matmat is going to see Doc Anok because…

00:02:35.071 --> 00:02:36.489
butterflies cure.

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.283
But…

00:02:39.242 --> 00:02:44.164
Matmat is still scared of butterflies.

00:02:44.247 --> 00:02:45.331
They're scary.

00:02:46.457 --> 00:02:51.337
What if Matmat gets
chased by the butterflies?

00:02:58.928 --> 00:03:00.054
Matmat?

00:03:02.473 --> 00:03:03.766
Why don't we stop running?

00:03:05.727 --> 00:03:07.812
{\an8}If you're still afraid,

00:03:10.064 --> 00:03:11.816
{\an8}I'll fight the butterflies for you.

00:03:13.985 --> 00:03:17.780
{\an8}You will fight them, Patpat?

00:03:18.573 --> 00:03:19.616
{\an8}Yeah.

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:23.411
{\an8}I'm a good boxer, remember?

00:03:24.245 --> 00:03:25.496
{\an8}Y-Yes!

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.249
{\an8}Patpat is a boxer.

00:03:28.333 --> 00:03:34.464
{\an8}When Patpat and Matmat fought,
his punches hurt a lot.

00:03:34.547 --> 00:03:36.424
{\an8}Patpat is a boxer.

00:03:36.507 --> 00:03:38.343
{\an8}I'll fight all of them.

00:03:38.426 --> 00:03:42.013
{\an8}Those chasing you,
your enemies… all of them.

00:03:42.096 --> 00:03:43.431
{\an8}But…

00:03:43.514 --> 00:03:45.225
{\an8}

00:03:45.308 --> 00:03:50.605
{\an8}Matmat should be
the one defending Patpat.

00:03:50.688 --> 00:03:51.773
{\an8}Because…

00:03:53.942 --> 00:03:55.360
{\an8}I'm older.

00:03:55.443 --> 00:03:56.819
{\an8}Yes, Matmat, but--

00:03:56.903 --> 00:03:58.863
Matmat can also fight

00:03:58.947 --> 00:04:00.949
because he can…

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.203
he can protect his brother.

00:04:15.546 --> 00:04:18.841
Finally, I'm getting rid of you.

00:04:18.925 --> 00:04:22.345
You talk like
you can't stand having me here.

00:04:22.845 --> 00:04:26.432
{\an8}Admit it, Doc,
you're going to miss your chess buddy.

00:04:26.516 --> 00:04:27.892
{\an8}

00:04:27.976 --> 00:04:31.062
{\an8}And those secret
chitchats in the storage room.

00:04:31.145 --> 00:04:32.522
{\an8}- Hmm?

00:04:32.605 --> 00:04:33.690
{\an8}

00:04:33.773 --> 00:04:34.941
{\an8}- I'll be off.
Alright.

00:04:35.024 --> 00:04:36.567
{\an8}- Goodbye.
Bye, Mister Tommy.

00:04:37.026 --> 00:04:39.445
{\an8}

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:44.701
{\an8}

00:04:46.494 --> 00:04:50.456
{\an8}I don't know if I should be happy or sad.

00:04:51.582 --> 00:04:54.127
{\an8}We've had two patients leave.

00:04:55.378 --> 00:04:57.297
{\an8}If you're talking about Zelda,

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.173
{\an8}there's nothing more we could do.

00:04:59.841 --> 00:05:03.928
{\an8}Her family transferred her
straight away to another hospital.

00:05:04.012 --> 00:05:08.141
{\an8}

00:05:08.224 --> 00:05:09.517
{\an8}But as for Tommy,

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.728
{\an8}let's just be happy for him.

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.063
Now that he's getting better,

00:05:14.147 --> 00:05:18.609
let's pray he continues
to heal and finds a peaceful life.

00:05:25.283 --> 00:05:27.702
And she's alive, Patrick!

00:05:27.785 --> 00:05:29.829
"I'LL BE BACK"

00:05:29.912 --> 00:05:32.540
She's here, inside the hospital.

00:05:39.922 --> 00:05:40.798
Patrick?

00:05:42.258 --> 00:05:43.426
Ma'am?

00:05:45.595 --> 00:05:46.971
Did you need something?

00:05:48.097 --> 00:05:49.932
Uh, I was about to ask,

00:05:50.016 --> 00:05:51.893
but it looks like you're busy.

00:05:51.976 --> 00:05:53.895
Are those love letters?

00:05:54.896 --> 00:05:56.147
Ah, no.

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:58.274
These are Matmat's sketches.

00:05:59.609 --> 00:06:00.777
Mm.

00:06:02.278 --> 00:06:07.867
I heard from the other nurses
something about patients leaving notes.

00:06:08.785 --> 00:06:10.703
You do know that's not allowed, right?

00:06:11.662 --> 00:06:13.039
Yes, ma'am, I do.

00:06:13.664 --> 00:06:16.125
- But nobody's left me one.
- Mm-hmm.

00:06:16.209 --> 00:06:17.418
That's good.

00:06:18.503 --> 00:06:21.464
You'll need to speak
to them if it happens.

00:06:23.216 --> 00:06:25.051
- Yes, ma'am.
- Anyway,

00:06:25.676 --> 00:06:27.929
I found a pair of tweezers…

00:06:28.012 --> 00:06:30.306
…in one of the rooms.

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:33.559
- Okay, I'll double check each room.
- Okay.

00:06:34.143 --> 00:06:37.396
Start with Tommy's
since he's already been discharged.

00:06:54.789 --> 00:06:56.332
M-Mister Tommy.

00:06:57.041 --> 00:07:00.336
Y-You're a patient at OK Hospital.

00:07:00.419 --> 00:07:01.963
Yes, that's me.

00:07:02.046 --> 00:07:03.381
You've been discharged?

00:07:05.049 --> 00:07:06.509
I'm going home.

00:07:06.592 --> 00:07:07.927
How about you?

00:07:08.427 --> 00:07:12.390
I-I'm going to Jason's restaurant.

00:07:12.473 --> 00:07:16.811
Then, I'll see Doc Anok for our session.

00:07:17.311 --> 00:07:22.024
He wants Matmat to draw butterflies.

00:07:22.108 --> 00:07:25.111
But Matmat doesn't want to.
He's scared of butterflies.

00:07:25.194 --> 00:07:27.572
Oh? Do butterflies…

00:07:27.655 --> 00:07:32.618
Do butterflies trigger
bad memories for you?

00:07:36.956 --> 00:07:38.249
Oh.

00:07:41.043 --> 00:07:42.336
I guess they do.

00:07:43.838 --> 00:07:46.424
But, Matmat?

00:07:47.592 --> 00:07:52.013
Don't let fear control you.

00:07:52.638 --> 00:07:55.808
Don't be like me.

00:07:56.559 --> 00:07:59.103
I was trapped in the past.

00:08:02.106 --> 00:08:06.027
T-Trapped in the, in the past?

00:08:06.652 --> 00:08:10.156
I couldn't escape.

00:08:11.449 --> 00:08:15.411
I couldn't find the door out.

00:08:23.377 --> 00:08:24.545
What happened?!

00:08:24.629 --> 00:08:26.756
There's an accident.

00:08:26.839 --> 00:08:29.717
A tire exploded.

00:08:49.278 --> 00:08:51.614
Mister Tommy!

00:08:51.697 --> 00:08:54.617
Mister Tommy!

00:08:57.537 --> 00:08:59.956
Mister Tommy, Matmat's here.

00:09:00.039 --> 00:09:03.084
Mister Tommy, Matmat's here.

00:09:03.167 --> 00:09:04.418
Matmat's here.

00:09:04.502 --> 00:09:06.212
Miss, could you help me?

00:09:06.295 --> 00:09:09.048
Call Patpat on speed dial 1.

00:09:09.131 --> 00:09:10.508
M-Mister Tommy.

00:09:10.591 --> 00:09:12.260
No one's picking up, sir.

00:09:12.343 --> 00:09:14.053
Try Gemma, please.

00:09:14.136 --> 00:09:15.721
Mister Tommy!

00:09:15.805 --> 00:09:17.557
Hello?

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:20.142
Gemma! Gemma, we need help.

00:09:20.226 --> 00:09:23.354
It's-It's Mister Tommy.
A-Are you at OK Hospital?

00:09:23.437 --> 00:09:26.315
Mister Tommy… We need help, Gemma.

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:29.193
Gemma! Gemma-- Mister Tommy.

00:09:29.277 --> 00:09:31.529
I'm here, Mister Tommy.

00:10:46.812 --> 00:10:48.230
Doc…

00:10:51.275 --> 00:10:53.527
I knew you'd be missing me.

00:10:54.987 --> 00:10:56.864
- Come on, Doc.
- Go on.

00:10:57.490 --> 00:10:58.783
Get some rest.

00:10:58.866 --> 00:11:01.911
Once you're better,
I'll have someone to beat at chess again.

00:11:01.994 --> 00:11:04.205
Doc.

00:11:04.914 --> 00:11:07.333
Take me back to my room, please.

00:11:07.416 --> 00:11:10.586
I don't want to be stuck in here.

00:11:14.215 --> 00:11:15.633
- Hmm?
- Alright, fine.

00:11:19.595 --> 00:11:22.014
It's hard to believe.

00:11:23.057 --> 00:11:27.353
We thought Mister Tommy
was cheerful and funny,

00:11:28.354 --> 00:11:31.107
but deep down
he still remembers the killings

00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:33.734
and violence from his past.

00:11:34.443 --> 00:11:35.945
Chances are,

00:11:36.529 --> 00:11:40.157
Mister Tommy
brought with him all the hurt,

00:11:40.658 --> 00:11:42.493
the nightmares,
and violence he experienced.

00:11:45.538 --> 00:11:48.874
I thought he had gotten better.

00:11:53.421 --> 00:11:54.880
But, Matmat…

00:11:55.381 --> 00:11:57.716
don't let fear control you.

00:11:58.551 --> 00:12:01.095
Don't be like me.

00:12:16.819 --> 00:12:18.070
Face your fears.

00:12:18.154 --> 00:12:22.199
Help Patrick by
facing your fear of butterflies.

00:12:29.457 --> 00:12:31.917
B-Butterfly…

00:12:32.001 --> 00:12:36.172
M-Matmat will draw a butterfly.

00:12:41.802 --> 00:12:43.512
I will fight them all.

00:12:43.596 --> 00:12:47.308
All of your enemies and
everyone who is chasing you.

00:12:48.392 --> 00:12:53.314
Matmat
should be the one to protect you.

00:12:53.397 --> 00:12:55.441
Matmat is the big brother.

00:12:55.524 --> 00:12:56.567
Butterfly…

00:13:03.699 --> 00:13:04.950
Matmat…

00:13:05.034 --> 00:13:06.243
Matmat can't do it.

00:13:07.995 --> 00:13:09.079
Matmat can't do it.

00:13:19.798 --> 00:13:21.842
Doc! Doc?

00:13:21.926 --> 00:13:23.802
Matmat? You okay?

00:13:23.886 --> 00:13:25.262
Does anything hurt?

00:13:26.388 --> 00:13:29.433
Patrick, I have good news.

00:13:30.518 --> 00:13:32.061
Your brother saved the day.

00:13:33.229 --> 00:13:36.482
Good thing he was with
Tommy when he had an episode.

00:13:36.899 --> 00:13:39.193
He acted like a responsible adult.

00:13:39.276 --> 00:13:40.402
He's a hero!

00:13:42.363 --> 00:13:43.489
Really, Matmat?

00:13:45.699 --> 00:13:48.244
Mm-hmm.

00:13:48.869 --> 00:13:52.122
M-Matmat helped.

00:13:52.206 --> 00:13:55.793
M-Matmat is a hero.

00:13:57.795 --> 00:14:00.464
Helping people is big deal.

00:14:01.298 --> 00:14:04.218
Is that why you called me here, Doc?

00:14:04.635 --> 00:14:06.595
Well, here's the thing,

00:14:06.679 --> 00:14:08.347
he has something to say.

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:12.393
What is it, Matmat?

00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:14.645
Do you have a new--

00:14:21.819 --> 00:14:26.282
M-Matmat tried to draw…

00:14:27.575 --> 00:14:31.912
a butterfly but,
Matmat couldn't do it, Patpat.

00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:38.752
Is it because of what we talked about?

00:14:40.421 --> 00:14:43.090
Because I said I would fight them all?

00:14:48.846 --> 00:14:51.807
Matmat, we can do this. Okay?

00:14:52.808 --> 00:14:55.644
- Little by little--
- Mister Tommy said…

00:14:58.147 --> 00:15:01.191
M-Mister Tommy said…

00:15:02.067 --> 00:15:03.527
Matmat…

00:15:05.487 --> 00:15:08.532
Matmat shouldn't be like him.

00:15:11.994 --> 00:15:13.495
How so?

00:15:20.669 --> 00:15:25.633
Don't be like Mister Tommy

00:15:25.716 --> 00:15:27.843
who was stuck in the past.

00:15:29.011 --> 00:15:33.140
Matmat shouldn't be stuck in the past.

00:15:39.772 --> 00:15:42.566
M-Mister Tommy said…

00:15:44.526 --> 00:15:49.740
M-Matmat might never find…

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:55.037
…the way out.

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:58.415
Matmat might be trapped forever.

00:16:01.335 --> 00:16:04.421
R-Remember Mia's book?

00:16:04.964 --> 00:16:10.886
"The Kid Batibat Visited"

00:16:12.888 --> 00:16:16.058
I, I let Mister Tommy borrow it.

00:16:19.561 --> 00:16:24.733
Because I remember what it said.

00:16:29.238 --> 00:16:30.781
What did it say?

00:16:33.367 --> 00:16:34.493
Our…

00:16:37.162 --> 00:16:41.667
painful memories…

00:16:42.876 --> 00:16:46.547
shape who we are.

00:16:49.174 --> 00:16:53.095
You won't be
able to tell the difference between

00:16:53.178 --> 00:16:55.389
pain and relief,

00:16:55.472 --> 00:16:59.977
happiness and sadness without them.

00:17:00.769 --> 00:17:02.354
How can I forget?

00:17:04.732 --> 00:17:10.112
I saw so many innocent people die.

00:17:12.448 --> 00:17:14.408
But, Mister Tommy,

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:16.493
you were just doing your job.

00:17:17.327 --> 00:17:19.663
You had to fight bad people.

00:17:20.914 --> 00:17:23.292
But they had kids on their side.

00:17:25.127 --> 00:17:27.004
I killed them, too.

00:17:27.629 --> 00:17:29.840
I should've protected the innocent!

00:17:29.923 --> 00:17:31.425
They shouldn't have been involved!

00:17:31.508 --> 00:17:33.510
They shouldn't have died!

00:17:40.017 --> 00:17:43.979
That's why these memories…

00:17:45.189 --> 00:17:47.024
should not be erased.

00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:50.861
We must acknowledge them and face them.

00:17:52.571 --> 00:17:58.577
Because if we ignore them,

00:18:00.287 --> 00:18:04.208
who we really are…

00:18:05.667 --> 00:18:08.921
will remain lost in sadness and darkness.

00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:12.091
Matmat.

00:18:13.592 --> 00:18:17.429
Mister Tommy said…

00:18:19.098 --> 00:18:23.519
It's okay to remember
what happened before.

00:18:26.647 --> 00:18:28.690
As long as you learn from it.

00:18:30.192 --> 00:18:31.193
So…

00:18:33.946 --> 00:18:34.947
Patpat…

00:18:38.867 --> 00:18:41.870
Matmat will fight back now.

00:18:41.954 --> 00:18:42.955
He will.

00:18:44.706 --> 00:18:47.960
But Matmat can't, he can't…

00:18:50.838 --> 00:18:54.633
Matmat can't draw a butterfly yet.

00:19:00.889 --> 00:19:02.224
Hmm, but…

00:19:03.016 --> 00:19:05.394
Matmat is ready to be brave.

00:19:09.398 --> 00:19:12.234
Just like Patpat.

00:19:15.487 --> 00:19:18.115
Um, Patpat?

00:19:21.201 --> 00:19:23.704
We won't move anymore.

00:19:25.455 --> 00:19:28.959
Every time the rainy season comes,

00:19:29.042 --> 00:19:32.421
we won't move anymore.

00:19:33.922 --> 00:19:37.968
Whenever it's Mama's death anniversary,

00:19:38.635 --> 00:19:40.095
Matmat won't…

00:19:42.097 --> 00:19:45.642
Matmat won't run
away from the butterflies.

00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:48.145
Way to go, Matmat!

00:19:48.979 --> 00:19:50.939
What a brave boy!

00:19:52.232 --> 00:19:53.233
So…

00:19:54.109 --> 00:19:56.987
are you ready to tell us what you saw?

00:20:02.117 --> 00:20:03.452
What I saw?

00:20:05.037 --> 00:20:06.914
What you saw that night.

00:20:08.957 --> 00:20:10.417
When…

00:20:12.294 --> 00:20:13.337
Mama was killed.

00:20:25.891 --> 00:20:29.353
I wonder what Matmat was thinking
when he was drawing you.

00:20:29.436 --> 00:20:32.231
There's a camping car, so you're leaving.

00:20:34.233 --> 00:20:35.442
Where?

00:20:37.027 --> 00:20:38.237
Why?

00:20:40.405 --> 00:20:41.823
To travel?

00:20:43.492 --> 00:20:45.118
But you said,

00:20:45.744 --> 00:20:49.081
you only leave when you're
running away from something.

00:20:53.627 --> 00:20:55.045
To escape?

00:20:57.422 --> 00:20:59.258
Escape what?

00:21:03.011 --> 00:21:06.139
What makes a person want to run away?

00:21:32.749 --> 00:21:34.042
Come on, Matmat.

00:21:39.506 --> 00:21:45.178
We picked up Mama that time,
remember Patpat?

00:21:46.013 --> 00:21:48.015
W-We picked her up.

00:21:50.892 --> 00:21:52.227
Ma!

00:21:52.311 --> 00:21:53.812
You can go ahead.

00:21:53.895 --> 00:21:55.731
I'll follow in a bit.

00:21:56.523 --> 00:21:58.025
Alright. Hurry up, okay?

00:21:58.108 --> 00:21:59.359
Follow us right away.

00:21:59.443 --> 00:22:01.111
Right away, Patpat.

00:22:01.194 --> 00:22:03.739
Patpat will follow us right away.

00:22:05.073 --> 00:22:06.992
Dear, are you hungry?

00:22:07.075 --> 00:22:09.286
Yes,
Mama. Matmat's hungry.

00:22:09.369 --> 00:22:13.081
Mama will
cook as soon as we get home.

00:22:15.125 --> 00:22:18.337
- Where's Patpat, Mama?
- He said he'll follow in a bit.

00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:21.214
I will go find Patpat, Mama.

00:22:21.298 --> 00:22:23.008
- Oh, Matmat.
- Patpat!

00:22:23.091 --> 00:22:24.217
Matmat!

00:22:24.634 --> 00:22:27.429
- Where are you?
- Matmat, be careful!

00:22:32.434 --> 00:22:34.019
Matmat!

00:22:36.146 --> 00:22:37.814
Patpat!

00:22:37.898 --> 00:22:40.275
- Matmat left…
- Where are you, Patpat?

00:22:40.358 --> 00:22:42.235
- so Mama was left alone.
- Patpat?

00:22:42.319 --> 00:22:46.907
Matmat thought he saw Patpat.

00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:48.283
Mama?

00:22:49.409 --> 00:22:50.702
Ma!

00:22:51.787 --> 00:22:52.996
Mama!

00:22:55.499 --> 00:22:58.502
- Patpat?

00:23:00.462 --> 00:23:04.424
Matmat went back for Mama.

00:23:05.509 --> 00:23:08.553
Matmat screamed.

00:23:08.637 --> 00:23:11.681
M-Matmat screamed!

00:23:16.311 --> 00:23:18.522
Ma'am, please don't hurt my son.

00:23:18.605 --> 00:23:20.816
- Please have mercy!
- Ma?

00:23:20.899 --> 00:23:23.110
Your husband
and I aren't having an affair.

00:23:23.193 --> 00:23:24.861
Liar!

00:23:24.945 --> 00:23:27.531
Please don't hurt my son!

00:23:30.075 --> 00:23:31.993
Mama!

00:23:32.077 --> 00:23:34.412
Mama!

00:23:34.496 --> 00:23:36.832
M-Matmat…

00:23:36.915 --> 00:23:38.208
…screamed!

00:23:38.291 --> 00:23:40.710
Matmat screamed, Patpat!

00:23:46.341 --> 00:23:48.718
- Matmat!
- Ma!

00:23:48.802 --> 00:23:49.886
Mama!

00:23:59.312 --> 00:24:00.772
- Mat--
- Ma!

00:24:10.323 --> 00:24:11.908
Matmat.

00:24:22.586 --> 00:24:24.004
Ma…

00:24:24.087 --> 00:24:26.047
You saw what just happened?

00:24:26.131 --> 00:24:27.716
Mm-hmm.

00:24:33.013 --> 00:24:36.808
You won't tell anyone, okay?

00:24:36.892 --> 00:24:38.310
Mm-hmm.

00:24:38.393 --> 00:24:41.479
If I find out…

00:24:41.563 --> 00:24:44.524
…you told anyone,

00:24:44.608 --> 00:24:47.485
I will kill you!

00:24:47.569 --> 00:24:51.907
Wherever you go, I will follow you!

00:24:56.203 --> 00:24:58.705
T-There was a butterfly on her dress!

00:24:58.788 --> 00:25:01.208
And I will make sure…

00:25:01.291 --> 00:25:02.834
I kill you!

00:25:05.795 --> 00:25:07.005
Matmat!

00:25:07.088 --> 00:25:08.798
Run!

00:25:08.882 --> 00:25:11.593
- Answer me!
- No! I won't do that!

00:25:11.676 --> 00:25:14.262
No, I won't do that!

00:25:14.346 --> 00:25:15.764
No!

00:25:15.847 --> 00:25:17.849
I won't!

00:25:19.184 --> 00:25:23.230
T-The woman's dress
had a butterfly on it, Patpat!

00:25:27.234 --> 00:25:29.861
S-She was wearing…

00:25:39.496 --> 00:25:41.373
This is the first time he's said that.

00:25:42.165 --> 00:25:43.124
Matmat?

00:25:43.208 --> 00:25:45.752
The woman, the woman…

00:25:46.294 --> 00:25:51.424
T-There was a butterfly
pinned on her dress!

00:25:53.593 --> 00:25:55.845
A woman, Matmat?

00:25:55.929 --> 00:25:57.555
A woman killed Mama?

00:25:57.639 --> 00:26:00.308
Do you remember the woman's face?

00:26:00.392 --> 00:26:02.852
N-No, Doc.

00:26:02.936 --> 00:26:05.939
Matmat can't remember.

00:26:08.942 --> 00:26:10.902
What about the butterfly?

00:26:10.986 --> 00:26:12.445
Do you remember what it looked like?

00:26:13.989 --> 00:26:17.200
M-Matmat
remembers seeing two butterflies.

00:26:17.284 --> 00:26:19.286
One big butterfly.

00:26:19.369 --> 00:26:21.955
And one small butterfly.

00:26:22.038 --> 00:26:24.499
They were on top of each other!

00:26:25.083 --> 00:26:26.376
On top of each other!

00:26:27.627 --> 00:26:32.132
They were pinned on the woman's dress!

00:26:33.591 --> 00:26:37.721
It was like a mommy
butterfly with her baby butterfly!

00:26:37.804 --> 00:26:39.431
On top of each other!

00:26:40.307 --> 00:26:45.437
T-They were pinned on the woman's dress!

00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:47.439
A butterfly didn't kill your mother.

00:26:49.649 --> 00:26:52.402
But a woman with butterflies on her dress.

00:26:52.485 --> 00:26:55.363
Is it like a brooch with a pin?

00:27:39.366 --> 00:27:40.492
What's the problem?

00:27:40.575 --> 00:27:42.160
He's avoiding me again.

00:27:42.243 --> 00:27:44.829
As long as Samuel lives,
his family can still be together.

00:27:44.913 --> 00:27:46.247
Mia's mother will come back?

00:27:46.331 --> 00:27:49.209
I'm now choosing who I want as my family.

00:27:49.292 --> 00:27:52.420
Is the punishment
the world gave me finally over?

00:27:52.504 --> 00:27:54.631
He won't ever tell
anyone what he's feeling.

00:27:54.714 --> 00:27:57.509
I've already told you everything I know.

00:27:57.592 --> 00:28:00.762
Mia's mother can't be
the reason my life got ruined.

00:28:00.845 --> 00:28:02.931
Only this house knows the whole truth.
