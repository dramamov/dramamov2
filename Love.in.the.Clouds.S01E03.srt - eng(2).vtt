ADAPTED FROM BAI LU CHENG SHUANG'S
LOVE IN THE CLOUDS

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.240
Immortal Ji.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.920
HOU ZHAO, JIXING ABYSS
FORMER CHIEF OF JUDGMENT HALL

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.640
You lost again.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.520
- That's right.
- As agreed,

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.080
Chief Hou Zhao, you may
request that I do one thing as punishment.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:50.360
I will do everything.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:51.720
Sure.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.320
How decisive of you.
Immortal Ji, you are really decisive.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.160
In that case, please answer me

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.960
whether the rumor out there is true.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.600
Have you
cultivated Golden Millet Dream before?

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.440
Yes. Tell us.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.960
- That's right.
- Tell us.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.880
Tell us.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.080
EPISODE 3

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.200
There has been a rumor in Jixing Palace

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.480
saying that your spiritual veins

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.080
were obtained through Heavenly Grief.

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.240
You used Heavenly Grief
yet you still live.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.720
Do you actually possess

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.520
the Golden Millet Dream?

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.120
To be honest,

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.000
I wasn't born with spiritual veins.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.480
I only

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.000
got it a bit later.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.600
Lord Hanfeng, you know

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.200
that someone
who committed a crime in Jixing Abyss

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.080
will be locked up in
the Sunken Abyss to be enslaved.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.680
I had been in
the Sunken Abyss since I was young.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.720
I was hungry and cold.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.920
I even had to work all day long.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.360
It was too exhausting.

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:00.800
In the end,

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.640
I couldn't stand living like that,

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.760
so I risked my life
to avoid the supervisor

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.440
and escaped the Sunken Abyss.

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.880
Then, I passed out

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.600
because my injury was too serious.

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:14.760
When I woke up,

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:16.800
my spiritual veins

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:19.320
grew on their own

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:21.279
for some reason.

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.120
Perhaps

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.840
it was all a blessing in disguise.

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:29.520
Lord Hanfeng,

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.160
I'm not telling everyone about this

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:34.800
because I don't want to remember

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.360
my painful past.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.560
My days in the Sunken Abyss

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:42.480
were truly a living hell.

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.720
You have been through a lot.

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.160
You've had

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.000
a hard time.

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.000
You have no choice

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.720
but to tell such blatant lies.

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:05.680
I understand why.

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:07.880
Golden Millet Dream
is a good thing after all.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.960
{\an8}Everyone must keep it a secret.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.360
However, let's look at
it from another perspective.

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:18.840
If everyone can have
a miraculous encounter like you,

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.600
wouldn't it be only a matter of time

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.600
before Jixing Abyss
can rule the Six Realms?

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.680
If you know something
about the Golden Millet Dream

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.360
yet won't share with other people,

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.880
won't that make
you a wanted criminal of Jixing Abyss?

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.760
Why are there so many people
who want the Golden Millet Dream?

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.160
Is Mu Qibai not going to give up?

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:54.680
Who is it?

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:18.680
Isn't she the fairy from Moonlit Blossoms?

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:21.160
Don't mind her.

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:23.880
Greetings, Lord Hanfeng.

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.240
I didn't notice you for so long.

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:32.920
You must not be an ordinary fairy.

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:35.560
Don't tell me…

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:39.120
Did you purposely choose

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.440
a fairy with spiritual
veins to be by your side,

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:42.440
Bozai?

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:53.160
Lord Hanfeng,
what's wrong with you tonight?

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:55.520
You asked me about
the origins of my spiritual veins,

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:58.840
and also suspect my people

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.520
of having spiritual veins.

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:11.000
DUAL CULTIVATION MANUAL

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:15.360
I asked her to come upstairs.

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:17.520
I didn't know you'd be here, Lord Hanfeng.

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.320
That was why I asked her to hide here.

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:23.240
A night together is worth a fortune.

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:28.480
Sorry to interrupt you both.

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:29.560
Bozai,

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:31.880
take care.

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:33.160
Wait. Let me send you off.

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:35.160
No need.

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:38.040
Lord Hanfeng, this is your first visit.
I should send you off.

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:41.960
Wait for me to come back.

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:59.360
That's enough. This is good.

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:01.320
- You may return.
- Take care.

00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:43.559
Worms?

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:45.880
A bug!

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:53.600
How come Wugui Sea's lady-in-charge

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:56.880
is so afraid of a small insect?

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:12.440
Thank you, My Lord.

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:15.240
It's late.

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:18.120
Why were you hiding in my bed?

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:21.880
I am the lady of Wugui Sea.

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:23.720
Can't I be in your bed?

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.240
My Lord, I…

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:44.040
He…

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:45.880
He's touching me.

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:53.160
My Lord, why are you doing this?

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:57.000
It seems like the Dual Cultivation Manual
is quite useful.

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:05.680
No. I must take back control.

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:14.400
My Lord, don't worry.

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:17.840
I know the rules.

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:27.840
Let me find it…

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:55.600
My Lord.

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:59.120
I'm prepared tonight.

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:00.240
After all,

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:03.720
I'm serious about you.

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:12.960
The Golden Millet Dream isn't on him.

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:17.880
Stop moving.

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:30.560
My Lord.

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:35.160
I don't like your outfit.
I'll talk to you later.

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:38.400
What kind of outfit do you like?

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:40.920
Why don't you like…

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:47.520
Hold on.

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:52.160
Fairies with spiritual
veins in the Six Realms

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:54.080
have Soul-hiding Nails
planted in them when they were born

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:55.280
to seal their spiritual veins.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.320
Just now,

00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:00.240
he was checking if
I had the Soul-hiding Nail.

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:03.400
Your Lordship,
I've obtained Ruo Shui's Moonshade Grass.

00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:05.560
Are you hurt?

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:07.560
- I'm fine.
- Don't be stubborn.

00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:09.400
With your level of cultivation,

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:10.480
I know you can go anywhere

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:12.840
without being noticed by her.

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:17.120
But you were almost found out
when you were there today.

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:19.240
Forgive me.

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:20.320
It's all right.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.640
Now that we've
obtained the Moonshade Grass,

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:33.520
it's time to meet Hou Zhao.

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:34.440
Yes.

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:41.240
WUGUI SEA PRISON

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:13.320
Ji Bozai. Ji Bozai.

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:15.720
How dare you!

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:17.720
You dare imprison me here?

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:21.320
The chief of Judgment Hall is missing.

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:23.920
Let's see how you handle it

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.120
when the higher-up investigates this!

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:30.840
Do you think you are so important?

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:38.480
Moonshade Grass?

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:40.240
Moonshade Grass!

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:44.880
How did you get it?
Where did you get it from?

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:48.480
Moonshade Grass can only be
found in Mangfu Swamp once in a century.

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:50.920
Immortal Hou Zhao,

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:53.120
am I sincere enough?

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:55.400
Your daughter, Ruo Shui,

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:58.440
suffers from
congenital Total Deterioration.

00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:00.880
With it,

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:04.880
the wish of your life

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:07.520
can be fulfilled, right?

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:17.680
No!

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:18.920
Stop!

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:22.320
If you give
the Moonshade Grass to Ruo Shui,

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:25.080
I will promise you anything! Anything!

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:29.240
Such a good father
who loves his daughter a lot.

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:30.520
Even I think

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:33.600
- I'm doing something despicable now.
- Sure.

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:35.400
Ji Bozai.

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:36.880
I promise you.

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:38.560
Just like you said,

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:41.160
I'll give you my memory.

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:49.600
Divine souls of all realms,

00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:52.080
Immortal Hou Zhao has permitted me

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:54.120
to obtain all his memories.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.920
Immortal Hou Zhao, thank you

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:20.120
for giving me all your memories.

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:22.600
Otherwise, I will
have to spend more effort

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:25.200
to find the people I want to get rid of.

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:44.080
Buxiu,
give the Moonshade Grass to Ruo Shui.

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:45.080
Yes.

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:47.000
How do you know
that it's him, Your Lordship?

00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:54.600
Have you
cultivated Golden Millet Dream before?

00:15:57.840 --> 00:15:59.080
Everyone in the world

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:00.600
thought Golden Millet Dream
was a kind of pill

00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:01.800
or a medicine.

00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:05.320
He was the only one
who used the term, cultivated.

00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:09.440
That's right. Have you investigated
Ming Yi's background?

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:12.440
Ming Yi is indeed the youngest daughter

00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:13.640
of a herb-gathering
family in Freezing Hot Waters.

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:15.680
After her parents passed away,

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:17.680
she came to the divine capital
and joined Moonlit Blossoms.

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:19.920
There's something else I found.

00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:22.280
Ming Yi's parents used to gather herbs

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:24.120
near the Sunken Abyss
when they were alive.

00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:28.240
I investigated their deaths.
They were poisoned by Blood Pearl Bloom.

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:32.720
Blood Pearl Bloom?

00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:42.080
The worm is rare and hard to cultivate.

00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:46.000
It can break barriers
to find what its master wants.

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:49.840
I'm sure Mu Qibai wants the worm to find
the Golden Millet Dream.

00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:52.000
Unfortunately, Ji Bozai killed it.

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:55.080
It's fine.

00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:57.400
There's one more.

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:08.280
A bug!

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:16.480
You're up next.

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:33.720
Your Lordship.

00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:40.520
He still found out in the end.

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:47.040
I've severed the connection
of the worm with its master.

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:49.200
From now on, it only obeys you.

00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:51.440
It will bring us to
the Golden Millet Dream.

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:11.960
You fool!

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:15.760
- Lord Chengyun, forgive me.
- You fool!

00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:18.360
The Search Mirror was
calibrated with Ming Xian's mask.

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:20.320
It will never malfunction.

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:23.680
I failed to capture him
and deserve to die.

00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:25.120
However,

00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:28.040
the Search Mirror reacted to a fairy.

00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:31.280
It was a woman.

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:33.320
It's impossible for her to be Ming Xian.

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:35.280
A fairy?

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.840
Where is she in Jixing Abyss?

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:42.120
- What is her name?
- She's in Jixing Abyss' Moonlit Blossoms.

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:43.040
Her name…

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:44.680
I don't know her name.

00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:48.840
I only know that the fairy
is probably serving Ji Bozai.

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:50.880
Ji Bozai?

00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:55.840
In five days, Shouhua Academy

00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:58.240
will begin choosing warriors
for the next Qingyun Tournament.

00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:01.080
His Lordship wants
you to attend the tournament too.

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:03.040
Please learn the rituals and rules

00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:05.600
of the divine capital
from me this afternoon.

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:06.840
Don't be late.

00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:11.160
Granny Xun is obviously testing you.

00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:13.400
If you slip up,
all our hard work will be in vain.

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:17.960
She is trying to test me on purpose,
which is why I should go.

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:20.600
But this is too dangerous.

00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:22.280
We have released the worm.

00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:24.600
We will find the Golden Millet Dream soon.

00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:27.440
Give me five days.
I'm sure we can endure it.

00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:35.360
Today, I'll give you a test.

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:38.120
Do you know
what the Qingyun Tournament is?

00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:40.080
A millennium ago, the Six Realms

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:43.280
have been fighting to get
the Nine Heavens' Blessed Rain.

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:45.040
To reduce the number of casualties,

00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:48.720
the six emperors formed an alliance
in front of Zhuojin Tower.

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:50.280
They agreed to organize
the Qingyun Tournament every year

00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:52.440
to decide who gets the Blessed Rain.

00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:55.400
WANGXING COURT

00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:00.360
With Hou Zhao's memory,

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:03.960
we can find out
the murderer who killed Fairy Bo that day.

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:10.560
I've been waiting so long for this.

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:29.040
- Granny Xun, why are you hitting me?
- Give me your hand.

00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:31.000
- What did I do to deserve this?
- Give me your hand?

00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:32.640
No hiding.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.920
Granny Xun, stop hitting me. I…

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.000
What is this about?

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:40.480
My Lord, save me.

00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:43.280
Granny Xun is beating me to death.
Look how swollen my hand is.

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:44.800
I can't even wear the thumb ring.

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:46.240
Granny Xun, what's going on?

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:47.960
Your Lordship,

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:51.080
I was asking Ming Yi a few
questions about the Qingyun Tournament.

00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:54.920
However, I realized her knowledge
of the Qingyun Tournament

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.200
has far exceeded ordinary fairies.

00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:59.000
I think her identity is very suspicious.

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:02.760
Please investigate, Your Lordship.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.680
My Lord, don't you trust me?

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.680
Now that Granny Xun mentioned it,

00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:17.200
I've been curious about it as well.

00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:19.840
Freezing Hot Waters

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:22.800
is located at the border of
Yaoguang Mountain and Jixing Abyss.

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:25.800
Most of the residents there
are herb-gathering attendants.

00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:28.200
They gather herbs all day long

00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:30.200
and work extremely hard.

00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:32.640
You also told me

00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:34.520
your family was poor,

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:39.040
yet you have the appearance
of someone who is privileged.

00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:41.800
The Qingyun Tournament is
a grand event among the Six Realms,

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:43.560
but there are only a few ordinary fairies

00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:47.200
who have witnessed the tournament,

00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:49.240
let alone understand the history of it.

00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:09.720
There are 365 days in a year.

00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:13.360
My father gathered herbs for 360 days.

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:16.920
His hands were bruised and pink.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.520
They didn't even resemble hands.

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:22.920
I could never wash the dirt off him.

00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:26.520
I only hoped for him to hug me
with his hands since I was young.

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:30.920
My mother did embroidery to make a living.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.480
She did it for a few decades.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.160
Her hands were full of calluses
and more kept growing.

00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:39.800
However, she still
wouldn't let me help her.

00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:41.920
That was how

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.000
I became someone who looked privileged

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:46.480
like you said just now.

00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:53.120
When they were alive,
I couldn't repay them properly.

00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:57.680
So, I tried
to learn more about the Qingyun Tournament

00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:00.120
because I don't want
to have any more regrets.

00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:01.960
It's also because

00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:08.120
you are the most important
person to me right now, My Lord.

00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:12.040
I want to know more about you.
Is it wrong to do that?

00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:13.160
Both of you may continue.

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:19.200
Are you doing this
to make him doubt you on purpose?

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:21.720
That's right.

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:23.840
He will feel very guilty
for letting down someone

00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:25.320
who treats him sincerely.

00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:26.880
You even know about that?

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:29.280
Do you think I stayed in
Moonlit Blossoms for nothing?

00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:35.520
You are good at crying.

00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:37.760
Come here.

00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:43.720
Your Lordship. What happened out there?

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:45.600
It's nothing. Continue.

00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:03.760
Your Lordship.

00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:14.320
I asked you

00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:18.280
to prepare a Blessing Cake

00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:19.840
as a tribute to the Emperor.

00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:24.280
Are you planning

00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:26.720
to make me a Funeral Cake instead?

00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:33.160
Your Lordship.

00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:35.240
During every festival in Jixing Abyss,

00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:37.280
every family will prepare
a Blessing Cake to pray for blessings.

00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:40.280
But Fairy Ming Yi
doesn't know how to make it at all.

00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:42.120
Something's wrong about this.

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:44.320
It's just a pastry.

00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:52.600
Blessing Cake. First, steam Chinese Yam
and mix it with a starch mixture.

00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:53.800
Add sugar, milk,

00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:55.360
and different types of flowers.

00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:57.480
Let it cool before shaping its form.

00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:00.160
As before,

00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:03.480
- you didn't mention one…
- There's one more crucial ingredient.

00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:04.800
Meteor's Night.

00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:06.200
It is a type of dew

00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:08.720
condensed on the Blessing Flower,
endemic to Jixing Abyss.

00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:11.360
How will I not remember
the recipe of Blessing Cake

00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:13.000
that every soul in Jixing Abyss knows?

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:15.600
So,

00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:17.520
did you make a mistake on purpose?

00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:21.920
Yes.

00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:25.880
I know you and Granny Xun

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:28.240
don't trust me.

00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:32.280
So, both of you did many things

00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:34.720
and worked together

00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:36.960
to test me multiple times.

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:40.480
I want to find
an opportunity to make things clear.

00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:44.080
Did many things? We didn't work together.

00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:54.760
Get along now.

00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:56.320
I…

00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:04.480
Blowing up the issue is
a trick to resolve the issue.

00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:08.640
Of course. If I want to resolve
the issue once and for all,

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:11.080
I must throw in a small benefit.

00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:17.920
- You can clean up for me.
- Granny Xun.

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:25.160
So you know how to make Blessing Cakes.

00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:26.440
What are you up to this time?

00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:28.560
I didn't know at first.

00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:30.400
I learned how to do
it after you taught me.

00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:32.840
Besides, you are so tired.

00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:34.280
I must offer you something in return.

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:37.600
I will never be duped.

00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:49.080
You are a moth, Granny Xun.

00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:51.280
You like leafy
vegetables and flower petals.

00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:53.040
I added rose and bay leaf

00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:55.280
in these Blessing Cakes.
What do you think?

00:26:58.200 --> 00:26:59.480
I'm not eating. Go out.

00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:01.960
Granny Xun, come on.

00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:03.960
SHEDDING THE OLD AND EMBRACING THE NEW

00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:04.960
Granny Xun.

00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:07.400
I'm sincere about being friends with you.

00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:08.560
Look.

00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:10.560
Lord Ji allowed me to stay here.

00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:12.080
You find me suspicious

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:13.680
and report to him as
soon as I make a small mistake.

00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:17.320
Won't that distract Lord Ji a lot?
Why don't we

00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:19.080
get along with each other peacefully?

00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:20.200
You can observe me more.

00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:22.360
If I do things right, all is well.

00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:23.720
If I make a mistake,

00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:25.720
catch me in the act
and chase me away immediately.

00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:26.720
Doesn't it solve
the problem once and for all?

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.040
Granny Xun.

00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:34.800
I only want to serve Lord Ji well.

00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:37.400
Lord Ji was a criminal.

00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:39.600
He doesn't have a confidant by his side.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.880
I'm sure you began serving him
in the middle of his journey.

00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:46.000
Why are you so loyal to him?

00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:52.400
I don't mind telling you the story.

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:54.760
I owed His Lordship a great favor.

00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:58.600
My former husband treated me badly.

00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:01.680
I wanted to kill him
and commit suicide after that.

00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:04.600
His Lordship passed by and saved me.

00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:06.440
He even offered me a new path in life.

00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:09.760
So, I will never betray His Lordship.

00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:14.600
It's my first time
hearing you say so many things.

00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:17.400
Lord Ji has good taste.

00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:21.040
He only keeps
people like you and me by his side.

00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:26.160
They are all yours.

00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:48.120
Are they delicious?

00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:50.280
Just all right.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.040
Your Lordship,

00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:56.640
I'm sure we won't be interrupted

00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:58.360
when we view Hou Zhao's memory this time.

00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:20.880
{\an8}BO'S MEDICAL CLASSICS, PART 1

00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:21.920
{\an8}Your Highness.

00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:24.720
We used every way possible

00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:26.360
but Bo Yulan

00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:28.240
wouldn't admit to anything.

00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:30.720
Is that all you can do?

00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:34.240
I was the one who made you the chief.

00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:35.640
Tell me.

00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:39.520
How should you be
punished for dereliction of duty?

00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:41.360
Your Highness.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.840
Let me show you the rope.

00:29:58.160 --> 00:30:01.160
Do you know what to do next?

00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:06.080
Your Highness, give me another chance.

00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:09.000
I'll surely find out the whereabouts
of the Golden Millet Dream formula.

00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:35.840
He's hard to please, isn't he?

00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:39.920
Look at me. Do you think he's happy?

00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:44.200
Bo Yulan is really stubborn. Even now,

00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:47.040
she still won't
reveal where the formula is.

00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:50.000
A member of an apothecary
family that can't fight at all

00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:52.200
endures everything

00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:53.760
with her stubbornness.

00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:57.920
No wonder the group of men
who besieged Zhangwei Mountain

00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:58.720
BO YULAN, JI BOZAI'S MASTER

00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:01.360
only obtained the first part of
Bo's Medical Classics 22 years ago.

00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:04.320
Without the second part
to complete the whole book,

00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:06.640
we will never make
the Golden Millet Dream successfully.

00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:08.560
Enough.

00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:09.920
Don't be so pessimistic.

00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:14.840
How can we face him
if we can't get anything out of her?

00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:16.120
All of us will suffer.

00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:18.360
I still have one more move.

00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:21.600
Soul-seizing

00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:24.000
Technique.

00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:28.320
This is an evil move.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.840
Seizing away her soul
to bring out her inner demon

00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:33.880
and force the truth out of her.

00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:36.040
If we can't find out anything after that,

00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:38.800
it can only mean that Bo Yulan

00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:41.800
doesn't know the whereabouts
of the Golden Millet Dream formula.

00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:32.960
I only need you to give me an answer.

00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:40.960
Your Highness,

00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:43.800
the general used
the Soul-seizing Technique on Bo Yulan.

00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:45.680
She couldn't endure it

00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:47.960
and her primordial spirit was destroyed.

00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:54.920
Master.

00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:05.560
Your Lordship.

00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:30.880
- The Golden Millet Dream?
- No.

00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:34.880
I think he has a nightmare.

00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:42.280
Buxiu.

00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:47.639
Master died

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:53.400
from their torture.

00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:21.240
If Hou Zhao hadn't slipped his tongue,

00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:24.920
I would have never caught him.

00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:28.280
Thanks to him,

00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:30.920
I finally know

00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:37.320
who Master's murderers are.

00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:41.600
Hou Zhao is just the beginning.

00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:46.120
I won't

00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:51.720
spare any of them.
