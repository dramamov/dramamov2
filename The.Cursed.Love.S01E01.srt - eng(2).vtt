- Oh...
- Ooh...

00:01:09.054 --> 00:01:11.174
At night with the blessing from Siva,

00:01:11.214 --> 00:01:13.894
the wishes of all prayers come true.

00:01:14.074 --> 00:01:16.734
I wish Tambralinga's in peace forever.

00:01:17.954 --> 00:01:19.094
What about you?

00:01:19.134 --> 00:01:22.812
I wish both of us were able to worship Siva

00:01:23.154 --> 00:01:25.102
right by each other side, like this, forever.

00:01:55.174 --> 00:01:56.374
Suriya!

00:02:13.334 --> 00:02:20.414
♫Every time the old's replaced with a new one♫

00:02:20.454 --> 00:02:27.394
♫Nothing's the same forever, it's all changed♫

00:02:27.434 --> 00:02:30.854
♫But there's one thing still remains♫

00:02:30.894 --> 00:02:34.974
♫That's my only one true love♫

00:02:35.014 --> 00:02:36.814
♫Through hundred thousand years♫

00:02:36.854 --> 00:02:42.094
♫It's still only you, not anyone else♫

00:02:42.454 --> 00:02:49.454
♫Keep my love safe and sound 'til that day♫

00:02:49.494 --> 00:02:55.294
♫I'll be there to be by your side, your side only♫

00:02:55.614 --> 00:02:59.054
♫Please hear my plead♫

00:02:59.094 --> 00:03:03.614
♫No matter how long it takes♫

00:03:03.654 --> 00:03:07.094
♫I'll still choose to love you♫

00:03:07.134 --> 00:03:14.536
♫This heart's forever loyal, no difference♫

00:03:15.054 --> 00:03:18.614
♫It keeps beating for you forevermore♫

00:03:18.654 --> 00:03:22.094
♫Never want to change, alright♫

00:03:22.134 --> 00:03:26.974
♫There's only you there inside my heart♫

00:03:27.014 --> 00:03:33.054
♫My love for you never evanesces♫

00:04:17.574 --> 00:04:19.214
When do we hit the road again?

00:04:19.334 --> 00:04:20.534
Hang on a sec.

00:04:20.894 --> 00:04:22.414
It takes us less than 3 hours

00:04:22.454 --> 00:04:23.654
to reach Nakhon Si Thammarat.

00:04:24.414 --> 00:04:26.094
But we have to reach Khao Luang
before it's dark.

00:04:27.014 --> 00:04:28.854
Right on, Siwat.

00:04:33.494 --> 00:04:34.334
Eh?

00:04:35.554 --> 00:04:36.974
This symbol is...

00:04:37.734 --> 00:04:39.083
It's like a symbol of wind

00:04:39.123 --> 00:04:42.054
from Shiva Nataraja statue
that my dad used to show me.

00:04:43.294 --> 00:04:44.814
I dreamed about it again.

00:04:45.934 --> 00:04:48.054
As we're getting closer to Nakhon Si Thammarat,

00:04:48.574 --> 00:04:50.574
everything becomes more obvious
than it'd ever be.

00:04:51.734 --> 00:04:53.254
Once we reach Khao Luang,

00:04:54.194 --> 00:04:57.294
I think we'll get a trace to
track down Tambralinga.

00:06:04.374 --> 00:06:07.694
This morning, Mrs. Maria Merton reported

00:06:07.734 --> 00:06:10.654
about Sin Siwat Merton's disappearance,

00:06:10.694 --> 00:06:12.774
who is an adopted son of Mr. Michael Merton;

00:06:12.814 --> 00:06:16.254
the king of a multi-billion empire "HMS Group."

00:06:16.894 --> 00:06:20.454
After Mr. Michael Merton passed away,

00:06:20.494 --> 00:06:24.814
the will states that Mr. Sin Siwat's the one
who bequeathed the estate

00:06:24.854 --> 00:06:27.334
and take care of his existing business
and all the asset remained.

00:06:27.374 --> 00:06:30.574
Meanwhile, Mrs. Maria Merton, the legal spouse,

00:06:30.614 --> 00:06:34.774
receive only 5% worth of all the asset.

00:06:41.014 --> 00:06:42.654
Here she comes.

00:07:13.594 --> 00:07:15.534
I wish to contest the will

00:07:15.574 --> 00:07:17.054
for justice.

00:07:17.094 --> 00:07:19.734
You believe the will's fake?

00:07:20.014 --> 00:07:22.134
This matter will be proven later on.

00:07:22.374 --> 00:07:23.654
But I strongly don't believe that

00:07:24.014 --> 00:07:26.494
Mr. Michael was driving recklessly to his death.

00:07:27.814 --> 00:07:29.734
That sounds like you're assuming that

00:07:29.774 --> 00:07:32.334
his death was not an accident.

00:07:32.654 --> 00:07:35.214
Michael adopted and took care of Siwat
with love and care.

00:07:35.594 --> 00:07:37.494
I'm also not so sure

00:07:37.794 --> 00:07:39.934
if he's that ungrateful.

00:07:40.554 --> 00:07:43.734
So you think this accident was caused by Mr. Siwat?

00:07:45.034 --> 00:07:47.294
The cop's working on this case.

00:07:48.554 --> 00:07:49.814
Siwat...

00:07:49.854 --> 00:07:50.914
If you are watching,

00:07:51.134 --> 00:07:52.394
you need to come back here

00:07:52.634 --> 00:07:54.654
to clear your own name.

00:07:55.994 --> 00:08:00.654
If anyone can provide a lead to Mr. Siwat Morton,

00:08:00.954 --> 00:08:02.534
we'll reward you, generously.

00:08:03.934 --> 00:08:04.934
Siwat!!

00:08:05.414 --> 00:08:06.334
Siwat!

00:08:09.574 --> 00:08:11.987
What about the leaked intimate photos of you

00:08:12.012 --> 00:08:13.934
and Mr. Michael's close person Aisoon?

00:08:13.974 --> 00:08:15.694
- Is that real?
- That's edited!!

00:08:16.294 --> 00:08:18.293
But some people have witnessed
you and Aisoon, though.

00:08:18.333 --> 00:08:19.934
I told you it's edited!

00:08:19.974 --> 00:08:21.174
I'm saying it loud and clear,

00:08:21.214 --> 00:08:22.294
don't you understand Thai?

00:08:22.334 --> 00:08:23.414
It's fake!

00:08:23.454 --> 00:08:24.294
It's fake!!

00:08:24.334 --> 00:08:25.734
- All fake!
- Hold on.

00:08:25.774 --> 00:08:26.814
- Maria!
- Mrs. Maria!

00:08:26.854 --> 00:08:27.854
Maria!

00:08:28.714 --> 00:08:30.934
Saying like I planned my father's death.

00:08:32.054 --> 00:08:34.494
Maria and my dad are trying to pressure you
so that you return.

00:08:35.474 --> 00:08:37.854
Both of them knew that
the yoni stone necklace's gone.

00:08:47.374 --> 00:08:49.014
Excuse me, I'm going to the bathroom.

00:09:02.214 --> 00:09:03.174
What the heck is this?

00:09:03.214 --> 00:09:05.254
Open your f*cking eyes!

00:09:05.894 --> 00:09:08.534
You told me if I could track his phone signal,

00:09:08.574 --> 00:09:10.054
you will find his whereabouts,

00:09:10.094 --> 00:09:11.414
and I'll get that necklace back!!

00:09:11.454 --> 00:09:12.654
And what the f*ck is this?

00:09:12.994 --> 00:09:14.694
We've been following them for hours.

00:09:14.814 --> 00:09:15.894
It takes time, don't you know that?

00:09:16.154 --> 00:09:17.614
It takes time?

00:09:18.134 --> 00:09:19.614
You f*cking told me

00:09:19.654 --> 00:09:22.054
you would find that brat Siwat so soon.

00:09:22.094 --> 00:09:22.854
What about this then?

00:09:22.894 --> 00:09:24.714
He's gone for half a day now!

00:09:24.754 --> 00:09:26.294
I've not heard anything new at all.

00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:27.974
You suck!

00:09:28.454 --> 00:09:29.414
Annoying b*tch!

00:09:29.674 --> 00:09:30.974
You actually are!

00:09:33.214 --> 00:09:34.454
I already told you

00:09:35.014 --> 00:09:37.094
that we should've killed them
before the will reading.

00:09:37.487 --> 00:09:38.767
You're so arrogant.

00:09:38.854 --> 00:09:40.134
Thought you could suppress them.

00:09:40.174 --> 00:09:42.094
What about now? Huh?

00:09:42.414 --> 00:09:43.734
It's a mess!

00:09:43.774 --> 00:09:45.254
This is all because of your stupidity.

00:09:48.374 --> 00:09:49.174
Do it.

00:09:51.254 --> 00:09:53.054
Damn it!

00:10:03.874 --> 00:10:05.454
Where did you find them?

00:10:08.074 --> 00:10:09.774
Finish your job

00:10:09.974 --> 00:10:11.934
before I withdraw one hundred million baht

00:10:12.114 --> 00:10:14.334
out of your Tambralinga tracking mission!

00:10:18.334 --> 00:10:19.734
Heard that?

00:10:20.254 --> 00:10:23.814
Take the necklace and Siwat back to me.

00:10:46.894 --> 00:10:47.894
Hello.

00:10:47.934 --> 00:10:49.134
- Hi.
- Hello!

00:10:49.734 --> 00:10:50.934
It's your treat today, Kor.

00:10:50.974 --> 00:10:52.774
Sure, what do you want?

00:10:53.014 --> 00:10:55.254
Americano, no sugar.

00:10:55.494 --> 00:10:58.174
Sweet orange juice would be it.

00:10:58.334 --> 00:10:59.374
Dang it!

00:10:59.614 --> 00:11:00.814
Are you a little girl?

00:11:01.054 --> 00:11:02.374
I'm thirsty.

00:11:06.694 --> 00:11:08.054
Drink whatever you want.

00:11:08.254 --> 00:11:08.974
Hey...

00:11:09.654 --> 00:11:10.854
What happened?

00:11:17.054 --> 00:11:17.734
Hey...

00:11:27.094 --> 00:11:27.774
Oh.

00:12:16.174 --> 00:12:16.814
Siwat!!

00:12:16.854 --> 00:12:17.734
Run!

00:12:20.894 --> 00:12:22.094
Hey.

00:12:23.734 --> 00:12:24.645
Come this way!

00:12:52.974 --> 00:12:54.214
Help me...

00:12:56.995 --> 00:13:03.995
♫Keep my love safe and sound 'til that day♫

00:14:14.635 --> 00:14:16.435
Hey, what's wrong?

00:14:45.635 --> 00:14:46.795
We have to reach Khao Luang.

00:14:47.175 --> 00:14:49.195
If we follow this map my dad made,

00:14:49.835 --> 00:14:51.115
we'll find Tambralinga.

00:14:52.235 --> 00:14:53.915
I'll go wherever you are.

00:14:57.555 --> 00:14:58.755
Excuse me, sir.

00:15:00.355 --> 00:15:01.155
What?

00:15:01.555 --> 00:15:03.915
The national park is about to close in 2 hours.

00:15:03.955 --> 00:15:05.915
If you want to visit the waterfall,

00:15:05.955 --> 00:15:07.555
you have to exit before 4 P.M.

00:15:07.595 --> 00:15:08.755
Alright.

00:15:09.235 --> 00:15:10.955
- This way.
- Thank you.

00:16:29.195 --> 00:16:30.315
If we can pass this river,

00:16:30.355 --> 00:16:31.915
we can walk past the hill.

00:16:35.715 --> 00:16:36.552
Come on.

00:17:13.355 --> 00:17:14.475
Hey, Dean.

00:17:15.515 --> 00:17:17.155
About Aisoon,

00:17:17.955 --> 00:17:19.955
you won't get punished because of me, right?

00:17:30.555 --> 00:17:31.395
Dean.

00:17:42.795 --> 00:17:44.795
You have to return the yoni necklace to me.

00:17:44.835 --> 00:17:45.715
If not...

00:17:45.755 --> 00:17:47.515
So, killing Michael still didn’t satisfy you enough?

00:17:48.015 --> 00:17:49.315
What the heck are you talking about?

00:17:53.475 --> 00:17:55.715
Are you sure Dean doesn't know about this?

00:17:57.195 --> 00:17:58.195
No worries.

00:17:58.615 --> 00:18:00.355
The evidence's eliminated.

00:18:01.595 --> 00:18:03.235
No one else knows about this now.

00:18:06.795 --> 00:18:09.195
I didn't believe you could do such a thing.

00:18:12.755 --> 00:18:14.075
Shut up.

00:18:15.295 --> 00:18:16.875
Siwat is next one in line.

00:18:17.295 --> 00:18:18.875
You just want the yoni necklace, right?

00:18:19.515 --> 00:18:20.835
I'll take it for you, dad.

00:18:21.555 --> 00:18:23.235
Whatever you want, I'll do it for you!

00:18:23.275 --> 00:18:25.075
But please don't hurt Siwat.

00:18:26.235 --> 00:18:27.735
But you have to mark your own words,

00:18:27.795 --> 00:18:29.075
and don't stay away from him.

00:18:30.515 --> 00:18:31.315
Dean...

00:18:37.995 --> 00:18:40.155
Thought you were concerned about me,
so you tagged along.

00:18:40.475 --> 00:18:41.875
So you're doing all this

00:18:42.675 --> 00:18:43.875
for Aisoon?

00:18:44.455 --> 00:18:45.995
I'm trying to protect you, Siwat.

00:18:48.315 --> 00:18:49.155
Siwat!

00:18:49.195 --> 00:18:50.075
Siwat!!

00:19:11.755 --> 00:19:12.915
I'm trying to help!

00:19:12.955 --> 00:19:14.235
Give me the yoni necklace!

00:19:14.915 --> 00:19:15.755
No!

00:19:26.835 --> 00:19:28.115
Give me that!!

00:19:38.415 --> 00:19:39.275
Damn!

00:19:51.395 --> 00:19:52.355
Siwat!!

00:19:53.395 --> 00:19:54.315
Siwat!

00:19:57.115 --> 00:19:58.035
Siwat!!

00:19:59.555 --> 00:20:01.075
Siwat...

00:20:03.315 --> 00:20:04.435
Siwat!

00:20:10.115 --> 00:20:10.995
Siwat.

00:20:12.035 --> 00:20:12.955
Siwat!!

00:20:13.355 --> 00:20:14.355
Siwat!

00:20:23.315 --> 00:20:24.235
Damn it!

00:20:49.515 --> 00:20:51.475
Anyone...please help.

00:21:27.475 --> 00:21:28.475
- Hey!
- Hey!!

00:21:28.515 --> 00:21:29.355
Come on.

00:21:31.035 --> 00:21:33.195
I was just about to inform you about the rangers.

00:21:33.315 --> 00:21:34.955
Really need a fight just for this?

00:21:38.355 --> 00:21:38.915
Hello, sir.

00:21:38.955 --> 00:21:40.115
Hello, everyone.

00:21:40.395 --> 00:21:42.755
Everyone, please take your belongings down.

00:21:43.295 --> 00:21:44.195
OK.

00:21:54.715 --> 00:21:55.555
Pun.

00:21:55.595 --> 00:21:57.315
Check them thoroughly.

00:21:57.355 --> 00:21:58.355
They've been waiting for us.

00:21:58.735 --> 00:22:00.435
I know.

00:22:01.355 --> 00:22:02.235
Boss,

00:22:03.955 --> 00:22:05.875
there are tourists in the waterfall area.

00:22:05.915 --> 00:22:06.915
They've not returned yet.

00:22:06.955 --> 00:22:07.915
This is their car.

00:22:08.075 --> 00:22:09.075
Help me!

00:22:10.435 --> 00:22:12.480
Hey, someone's coming this way.

00:22:18.875 --> 00:22:19.515
Sir.

00:22:20.155 --> 00:22:20.875
Sir...

00:22:23.035 --> 00:22:23.955
Boss...

00:22:24.315 --> 00:22:26.675
This is one of the tourists I mentioned.

00:22:27.415 --> 00:22:28.355
What about another one?

00:22:29.195 --> 00:22:30.574
My friend's in there.

00:22:31.155 --> 00:22:32.155
Where is he now?

00:22:32.315 --> 00:22:33.315
In the forest...

00:22:35.575 --> 00:22:36.675
Help me...

00:22:38.595 --> 00:22:40.035
Help me, please. Anyone...

00:22:40.915 --> 00:22:42.035
Help me!!

00:22:42.075 --> 00:22:42.795
Hey...

00:22:44.355 --> 00:22:45.115
What is it?

00:22:46.235 --> 00:22:47.155
Didn't you hear that?

00:22:47.195 --> 00:22:48.435
No, what?

00:22:50.195 --> 00:22:51.395
You take this person to the hospital!

00:22:52.435 --> 00:22:53.645
Lookwaii, call the ambulance.

00:22:53.835 --> 00:22:54.995
Pun, help me!

00:24:32.015 --> 00:24:33.435
- Watch out.
- Ouch!

00:24:34.395 --> 00:24:35.115
Ouch...

00:24:35.235 --> 00:24:36.125
It hurts.

00:24:37.175 --> 00:24:38.235
Be careful.

00:24:49.795 --> 00:24:50.555
What are you staring at?

00:24:50.595 --> 00:24:51.275
Your necklace is...

00:24:51.315 --> 00:24:52.915
just like what I have.

00:24:57.776 --> 00:25:04.536
♫My love for you never evanesces♫

00:25:20.976 --> 00:25:21.976
Hang in there.

00:25:22.396 --> 00:25:25.376
I'll take you to the hospital in town.

00:25:36.536 --> 00:25:37.216
Hmm?

00:25:37.996 --> 00:25:38.896
What, sir?

00:25:40.376 --> 00:25:41.176
Oh...

00:25:41.776 --> 00:25:42.776
Nothing, sir.

00:25:42.976 --> 00:25:44.016
I'm sorry.

00:25:58.576 --> 00:26:00.176
Team, do you hear me?

00:26:00.816 --> 00:26:01.696
What's up?

00:26:02.596 --> 00:26:03.896
I found the injured.

00:26:05.756 --> 00:26:06.656
Location?

00:26:07.256 --> 00:26:09.256
Down the hill, in front of Lom Fon Hill.

00:26:09.696 --> 00:26:11.296
He is conscious,

00:26:11.336 --> 00:26:12.496
just slightly injured.

00:26:12.736 --> 00:26:13.916
You can come after me now.

00:26:15.256 --> 00:26:15.936
Hold on.

00:26:15.976 --> 00:26:17.576
We can't go there now.

00:26:17.616 --> 00:26:18.616
It's dangerous.

00:26:19.096 --> 00:26:20.019
Why?

00:26:20.296 --> 00:26:23.056
It's Duan's hunting time.

00:26:23.536 --> 00:26:25.056
Khun, heard that?

00:26:26.336 --> 00:26:27.336
Yes.

00:26:29.456 --> 00:26:31.616
The rescue team can come take us
tomorrow morning.

00:26:32.536 --> 00:26:33.536
Yes, sir.

00:26:34.316 --> 00:26:35.316
Copy that.

00:26:37.316 --> 00:26:39.416
What does Duan refer to?

00:26:40.256 --> 00:26:41.936
And why do we have to wait
until the next morning?

00:26:42.416 --> 00:26:43.416
It's the name of the tiger.

00:26:43.976 --> 00:26:44.896
A tiger?

00:26:50.536 --> 00:26:52.656
We have to find a place to stay
that's far from his reach.

00:26:56.136 --> 00:26:56.976
Follow me.

00:27:02.456 --> 00:27:03.336
Be careful.

00:27:09.496 --> 00:27:10.376
Hey.

00:27:10.416 --> 00:27:12.816
Why do we have to be afraid of a tiger this much?

00:27:14.476 --> 00:27:15.696
Because it's a tiger,

00:27:15.736 --> 00:27:16.736
not a kitten.

00:27:20.416 --> 00:27:21.576
Actually,

00:27:22.136 --> 00:27:23.899
humans are the one intruding his habitat.

00:27:24.556 --> 00:27:25.936
No creature would love anyone

00:27:26.576 --> 00:27:28.536
invading their area.

00:27:29.616 --> 00:27:31.976
Then the forest should be preserved.

00:27:33.736 --> 00:27:35.135
That sounds right to my ear.

00:27:55.276 --> 00:27:56.336
Here you go, bro.

00:27:58.996 --> 00:28:00.456
Let me see...

00:28:00.776 --> 00:28:02.816
Anything delicious?

00:28:03.476 --> 00:28:05.016
I'm always generous though.

00:28:06.636 --> 00:28:07.376
Let me see.

00:28:08.976 --> 00:28:09.936
That's good.

00:28:10.116 --> 00:28:11.296
Looks nice.

00:28:11.336 --> 00:28:12.256
What is this?

00:28:13.376 --> 00:28:14.736
This looks yummy.

00:28:15.842 --> 00:28:16.642
This.

00:28:18.056 --> 00:28:19.456
Oh, f*ck!

00:28:19.656 --> 00:28:21.736
Stir-fired sukiyaki with chicken.

00:28:22.536 --> 00:28:23.736
I'll put it here.

00:28:24.636 --> 00:28:25.636
This...

00:28:29.416 --> 00:28:31.536
Fish with chili sauce and rice.

00:28:32.216 --> 00:28:33.216
I'll eat this.

00:28:33.416 --> 00:28:34.856
Then you take the sukiyaki.

00:28:34.896 --> 00:28:37.016
Alright, give me a spoon.

00:28:37.456 --> 00:28:38.816
Here you go.

00:28:45.216 --> 00:28:46.316
Kor.

00:28:47.476 --> 00:28:49.156
Will it rain tomorrow?

00:28:49.196 --> 00:28:50.616
I'm feeling worried about Khun.

00:28:51.136 --> 00:28:52.456
I don't think it'll rain.

00:28:53.456 --> 00:28:54.816
Let's rescue him early in the morning,
shall we?

00:28:54.976 --> 00:28:55.736
Umm.

00:28:55.976 --> 00:28:57.056
Umm, eat now, bro.

00:28:57.096 --> 00:28:57.936
Eat!

00:29:11.256 --> 00:29:12.736
Smells so incredible.

00:29:13.296 --> 00:29:15.056
It's so warm!

00:29:20.496 --> 00:29:22.276
- Cheers!
- Cheers!!

00:29:53.816 --> 00:29:55.116
That's Duan's roar.

00:29:56.256 --> 00:29:57.496
Will he approach us?

00:29:58.376 --> 00:29:59.496
This is not his usual path.

00:30:06.936 --> 00:30:07.936
Take some rest.

00:30:34.856 --> 00:30:35.856
What are you staring at?

00:30:40.576 --> 00:30:41.616
Your necklace is

00:30:43.816 --> 00:30:46.216
just like what I have.

00:30:54.336 --> 00:30:55.616
How did you get that?

00:31:01.816 --> 00:31:02.816
It's from my dad.

00:31:25.416 --> 00:31:27.416
He collected it from Khao Luang

00:31:27.976 --> 00:31:29.696
and he made me wear it all the time.

00:31:42.836 --> 00:31:44.456
So what happened with you?

00:31:45.756 --> 00:31:46.496
Hmm?

00:32:29.336 --> 00:32:36.336
♫Every time the old's replaced with a new one♫

00:32:36.376 --> 00:32:43.376
♫Nothing's the same forever, it's all changed♫

00:32:43.416 --> 00:32:50.936
♫But there's one thing still remains
That's my only one true love♫

00:32:50.976 --> 00:32:58.136

00:32:58.416 --> 00:33:05.376
♫Keep my love safe and sound 'til that day♫

00:33:05.416 --> 00:33:11.376
♫I'll be there to be by your side, your side only♫

00:33:11.416 --> 00:33:15.216
♫Please hear my plead♫

00:33:15.256 --> 00:33:19.616
♫No matter how long it takes♫

00:33:19.656 --> 00:33:23.096
♫I'll still choose to love you♫

00:33:23.136 --> 00:33:30.256
♫This heart's forever loyal, no difference♫

00:33:31.016 --> 00:33:34.576
♫It keeps beating for you forevermore♫

00:33:34.616 --> 00:33:38.096
♫Never want to change, alright♫

00:33:38.136 --> 00:33:42.936
♫There's only you there inside my heart♫

00:33:42.976 --> 00:33:47.496
♫My love for you never evanesces♫

00:37:13.736 --> 00:37:15.096
Be careful.

00:37:23.016 --> 00:37:23.888
OK.

00:37:33.416 --> 00:37:35.376
- Hey, Kor.
- What?

00:37:35.416 --> 00:37:36.616
That way!

00:37:37.696 --> 00:37:38.896
Go, go.

00:37:44.056 --> 00:37:45.936
What the f*ck?

00:37:54.656 --> 00:37:55.736
- Hey!
- Hey!!

00:37:56.536 --> 00:37:57.456
Be careful, man.

00:38:01.376 --> 00:38:02.776
This is Kor, that is Pun.

00:38:02.936 --> 00:38:03.776
They're in my team.

00:38:03.816 --> 00:38:05.056
Hey, hi.

00:38:06.736 --> 00:38:08.656
Your friend...?

00:38:09.656 --> 00:38:10.656
What's your name?

00:38:11.496 --> 00:38:12.496
I'm Siwat.

00:38:12.816 --> 00:38:14.096
How about his friend?

00:38:14.496 --> 00:38:15.736
He's at the hospital.

00:38:15.776 --> 00:38:16.896
He's safe,

00:38:16.936 --> 00:38:18.376
but lost lots of blood,

00:38:18.656 --> 00:38:19.696
that's why he's still hospitalized.

00:38:19.736 --> 00:38:20.896
Thara's watching him now.

00:38:22.136 --> 00:38:22.936
It's...

00:38:27.096 --> 00:38:28.256
He tried to kill me.

00:38:38.136 --> 00:38:40.576
I'm Sin Siwat Merton.

00:38:40.616 --> 00:38:41.776
So your father is...

00:38:41.816 --> 00:38:43.256
I'm Michael Merton's son.

00:38:43.296 --> 00:38:44.097
Hey!

00:38:44.137 --> 00:38:45.016
Calm down.

00:38:45.056 --> 00:38:46.296
What the heck do you want?

00:38:46.336 --> 00:38:48.147
- What?
- I had nothing to do with it.

00:38:48.317 --> 00:38:55.117
♫Keep my love safe and sound 'til that day♫

00:38:55.957 --> 00:38:56.957
Hello, Lookwaii.

00:38:56.997 --> 00:38:57.997
Is he up now?

00:39:00.117 --> 00:39:01.037
Oh...

00:39:01.077 --> 00:39:02.077
I'm at the 7-eleven.

00:39:02.117 --> 00:39:03.117
You want anything?

00:39:05.297 --> 00:39:06.917
Alright, I'll buy it for you.

00:39:12.637 --> 00:39:13.437
Hi.

00:39:13.477 --> 00:39:14.877
- What?
- Where's a gum?

00:39:15.117 --> 00:39:16.477
On this shelf, sir.

00:39:16.517 --> 00:39:17.617
Alright.

00:39:19.477 --> 00:39:21.157
- This is your basket.
- Thank you.

00:39:21.197 --> 00:39:23.437
- Ask me if you need help.
- OK.

00:39:36.557 --> 00:39:37.837
[Emergency Center]

00:39:42.377 --> 00:39:43.577
Mam,

00:39:43.617 --> 00:39:44.957
if there's anything wrong,

00:39:44.997 --> 00:39:46.437
let us know, immediately.

00:39:46.477 --> 00:39:47.717
- Thank you.
- OK.

00:39:58.917 --> 00:39:59.877
Lookwaii, here you go.

00:40:00.617 --> 00:40:01.597
Thanks.

00:40:04.857 --> 00:40:05.857
What's up with him?

00:40:08.637 --> 00:40:09.737
The doctor already dressed his wound.

00:40:09.777 --> 00:40:10.937
Nothing severe, I guess.

00:40:11.197 --> 00:40:12.717
But the doctor wants him to stay longer

00:40:12.757 --> 00:40:15.037
to check on his brain.

00:40:15.637 --> 00:40:17.637
He's not woken up yet.

00:40:23.777 --> 00:40:25.717
Sh*t, Khun's calling me.

00:40:26.537 --> 00:40:27.877
Don't know what's wrong.

00:40:31.717 --> 00:40:32.837
What's up, Khun?

00:40:33.217 --> 00:40:35.757
When will you arrive?

00:40:39.237 --> 00:40:40.237
Dean?

00:40:41.877 --> 00:40:44.677
You mean that friend
who got a head injury?

00:40:45.497 --> 00:40:46.757
He's not gaining his consciousness yet.

00:40:48.557 --> 00:40:49.997
Tried to hurt?

00:40:50.637 --> 00:40:51.957
Hurt who?

00:40:54.297 --> 00:40:55.397
Watch him.

00:40:55.597 --> 00:40:56.877
He's a dangerous person.

00:40:58.297 --> 00:40:59.877
Alright, I'll be there.

00:41:00.157 --> 00:41:02.317
Alright, I'll take care of this myself.

00:41:04.997 --> 00:41:06.357
I'll drop you home first.

00:41:06.497 --> 00:41:07.397
Get in the car!

00:41:08.037 --> 00:41:09.497
- Kor.
- Huh?

00:41:10.237 --> 00:41:11.158
I'm leaving.

00:41:11.198 --> 00:41:12.862
- I'm leaving now.
- Thank you.

00:41:30.397 --> 00:41:31.437
Holy sh*t!

00:41:32.997 --> 00:41:34.437
He must've escaped through the door.

00:41:36.317 --> 00:41:37.237
What happens?

00:41:37.277 --> 00:41:38.597
The patient's gone now.

00:41:57.277 --> 00:41:58.618
- OK, bro.
- OK!

00:41:59.157 --> 00:42:00.477
Excuse me.

00:42:03.217 --> 00:42:04.117
Hey, you.

00:42:04.917 --> 00:42:06.077
I've thought this through.

00:42:07.077 --> 00:42:08.317
Is it possible

00:42:08.637 --> 00:42:10.112
if that person tried to kill you?

00:42:12.617 --> 00:42:14.197
I'm not sure of that.

00:42:15.377 --> 00:42:17.077
It may be about the inheritance.

00:42:17.417 --> 00:42:19.077
Is that such a large amount?

00:42:23.397 --> 00:42:24.037
I'm talking.

00:42:24.317 --> 00:42:25.197
Khun!

00:42:25.237 --> 00:42:27.397
Dean's run away from the hospital.

00:42:28.037 --> 00:42:28.757
Huh?

00:42:29.617 --> 00:42:31.157
You report this to the cop right now,

00:42:31.277 --> 00:42:32.437
so they can help you.

00:42:32.477 --> 00:42:33.477
I'm leaving real quick.

00:42:33.677 --> 00:42:34.837
OK, fine.

00:42:36.597 --> 00:42:37.397
Kor!

00:42:37.437 --> 00:42:38.923
- Take him to rest.
- Wait.

00:42:51.437 --> 00:42:52.517
Get out!

00:42:52.557 --> 00:42:54.877
Before I file trespassing charges against you.

00:42:54.917 --> 00:42:55.957
What happened, Kor?

00:42:55.997 --> 00:42:57.557
I don't know, let's get inside.

00:42:58.957 --> 00:43:00.157
Aunt Kate, report this to the police.

00:43:00.757 --> 00:43:02.237
I signed as a guarantor

00:43:02.557 --> 00:43:04.077
but the one that took the loan was my relative.

00:43:05.077 --> 00:43:06.677
That one already fleet away.

00:43:11.757 --> 00:43:13.237
And the loan amount together with

00:43:14.917 --> 00:43:16.397
loan interest...

00:43:16.437 --> 00:43:17.557
The total is 500K.

00:43:18.337 --> 00:43:19.277
If you don't pay me back,

00:43:19.317 --> 00:43:20.557
I'll seize your everything,

00:43:21.117 --> 00:43:22.717
including the shares of your homestay.

00:43:23.337 --> 00:43:24.637
Nonsense!

00:43:25.097 --> 00:43:26.797
While making a contract, Aunt Kate signed

00:43:26.837 --> 00:43:28.317
to be accountable for only 200K.

00:43:28.577 --> 00:43:30.277
I'll file a report

00:43:30.557 --> 00:43:31.957
for fraud

00:43:31.997 --> 00:43:33.277
if you keep running your mouth!

00:43:33.317 --> 00:43:34.237
Go ahead.

00:43:34.277 --> 00:43:35.477
Call the cop on me.

00:43:35.637 --> 00:43:36.597
Do it now!

00:43:37.197 --> 00:43:38.117
Oh!

00:43:40.917 --> 00:43:43.277
This homestay has two owners.

00:43:43.437 --> 00:43:45.837
Yes, that's Uncle Singkhon and Aunt Kate!

00:43:50.317 --> 00:43:51.077
Hey...

00:43:52.357 --> 00:43:54.477
You can't seize the land

00:43:54.517 --> 00:43:55.997
without the owner's consent!

00:43:58.037 --> 00:44:01.197
Another owner they mentioned is
Singkhon Hunter of Phrom Khiri?

00:44:01.237 --> 00:44:02.637
You know him, personally?

00:44:04.477 --> 00:44:06.157
Then pay me 200K!

00:44:07.477 --> 00:44:10.317
Otherwise, I'll sue you so
the whole town knows about it.

00:44:11.957 --> 00:44:12.957
Try me.

00:44:15.437 --> 00:44:16.877
I'll do that on her behalf.

00:44:23.717 --> 00:44:24.517
Who are you?

00:44:25.137 --> 00:44:26.557
I'm a son of her friend.

00:44:29.197 --> 00:44:30.517
If you want my money,

00:44:32.877 --> 00:44:33.717
give me your account number.

00:44:34.337 --> 00:44:35.197

Give me the loan contract.

00:45:01.497 --> 00:45:03.237
The transaction's valid.

00:45:03.997 --> 00:45:05.237
If you play tricks,

00:45:05.657 --> 00:45:06.797
I'll call the cop.

00:45:11.237 --> 00:45:12.397
Your business is done. Now, go.

00:45:12.797 --> 00:45:13.797
Go.

00:45:15.957 --> 00:45:17.557
I'd like to excuse myself, Ms. Kate.

00:45:26.797 --> 00:45:27.597
Hey!

00:45:28.297 --> 00:45:29.297
Don't cause a trouble.

00:45:29.677 --> 00:45:30.477
Come.

00:45:35.317 --> 00:45:36.117

Yes, I'm his son.

Yes, right.

00:46:13.777 --> 00:46:14.597
