WEBVTT

00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:04.546
I have no choice but to
suspend you for 10 days. Without pay.

00:00:04.629 --> 00:00:07.340
Maybe Doc will change
his mind if you apologize to Jerome.

00:00:07.424 --> 00:00:08.591
- Just say--
- Gemma.

00:00:08.675 --> 00:00:09.634
It's what I wanted.

00:00:09.718 --> 00:00:11.886
You did it for Mia.

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:13.430
You said you'd leave everything behind

00:00:13.513 --> 00:00:16.349
if I just asked
you to run away from all this.

00:00:16.433 --> 00:00:18.184
Let's go? Let's run away.

00:00:18.268 --> 00:00:19.644
We'll go to Montanesa.

00:00:19.728 --> 00:00:20.770
Montanesa?

00:00:20.854 --> 00:00:22.021
That's five hours away.

00:00:22.105 --> 00:00:25.150
I can't stay overnight anyway.

00:00:25.233 --> 00:00:26.693
I'll drive this car off the cliff.

00:00:26.776 --> 00:00:28.445
- What?!
- We'll die together!

00:00:28.528 --> 00:00:29.946
Mia!

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:32.991
You don't make sense!

00:00:33.074 --> 00:00:36.327
You asked me to run away,
but you can't even stay long?

00:00:36.411 --> 00:00:39.122
- You deserve that!

00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:46.546
Ingrid?

00:00:47.297 --> 00:00:48.673
- Ah!

00:01:50.276 --> 00:01:51.528
Mia.

00:01:51.611 --> 00:01:53.780
I left some letters on your desk.

00:01:55.907 --> 00:01:57.492
Hey!

00:01:57.575 --> 00:01:59.661
Why are you throwing stuff at me?!

00:01:59.744 --> 00:02:01.746
Are you coming with me,
somewhere far away?

00:02:02.247 --> 00:02:03.123
Mia…

00:02:03.998 --> 00:02:04.999
Hey!

00:02:06.334 --> 00:02:07.961
Don't talk to me!

00:02:09.838 --> 00:02:11.005
Huh?

00:02:11.631 --> 00:02:13.967
So annoying!

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.010
Oh, right.

00:02:16.094 --> 00:02:17.762
She's in a bad mood.

00:02:23.476 --> 00:02:26.479
He's so annoying!

00:03:03.558 --> 00:03:08.104
"THE SHADOWS BEHIND A NEW FACE"

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:12.400
Mama's manuscript?

00:03:24.287 --> 00:03:27.665
{\an8}

00:03:30.668 --> 00:03:37.091
{\an8}

00:03:46.184 --> 00:03:47.727
{\an8}

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:54.692
{\an8}

00:04:00.698 --> 00:04:01.824
{\an8}

00:04:05.828 --> 00:04:09.874
{\an8}Read the book I put on your desk.
It'll help with your short story.

00:04:10.333 --> 00:04:11.292
{\an8}Yes, Mama.

00:04:11.376 --> 00:04:13.127
{\an8}You need to have a strong portfolio.

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:16.631
{\an8}Once I get promoted as nurse manager,

00:04:16.714 --> 00:04:19.008
{\an8}I can help with your expenses.

00:04:20.343 --> 00:04:22.845
{\an8}So when you get into
the University of Marlowe--

00:04:22.929 --> 00:04:24.514
{\an8}- If I get in--
When you!

00:04:26.683 --> 00:04:29.143
{\an8}…get into the University of Marlowe,

00:04:29.727 --> 00:04:31.437
{\an8}you have to stay focused

00:04:31.521 --> 00:04:34.607
{\an8}on being the best writer in that batch.

00:04:38.403 --> 00:04:40.154
{\an8}Do you understand?

00:04:40.822 --> 00:04:41.948
{\an8}Yes, Mama.

00:04:42.031 --> 00:04:45.326
{\an8}

00:04:48.246 --> 00:04:51.457
{\an8}

00:04:51.541 --> 00:04:54.585
{\an8}- A dinosaur! It's a dinosaur!
A dinosaur!

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:56.087
{\an8}- My name is Trexy.
Trexy.

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:58.298
{\an8}- A talking dinosaur?
A talking dinosaur?

00:04:58.381 --> 00:04:59.924
{\an8}I hate Trexy!

00:05:01.926 --> 00:05:03.386
{\an8}You made a mess again, Trexy.

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:05.138
{\an8}I'm sorry, Mister Junior.

00:05:05.221 --> 00:05:07.724
You don't like Trexy?

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:09.600
I don't.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.771
He's annoying.
All he does is make a mess at home.

00:05:13.855 --> 00:05:15.690
Aaah!

00:05:15.773 --> 00:05:19.110
Papa, please. We'll take care of Trexy.

00:05:19.193 --> 00:05:22.822
I think I like Mister Junior more.

00:05:23.614 --> 00:05:26.034
Okay, fine. Trexy can live here.

00:05:26.117 --> 00:05:27.452
Really, Papa?

00:05:27.535 --> 00:05:28.661
See?

00:05:28.745 --> 00:05:30.663
Mister Junior is a nice guy.

00:05:30.747 --> 00:05:33.708
He let Trexy stay even if he's a handful.

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:38.254
Matmat likes M-Mister Junior too.

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:41.174
You're right. He's kind.

00:05:41.257 --> 00:05:44.427
And since he's older,

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:51.559
he looks after Buboy, Chacha and Trexy.

00:05:52.101 --> 00:05:54.729
Just like Matmat.

00:05:54.812 --> 00:05:59.692
Matmat is older than Patpat,
so he looks after him.

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.780
Earlier at Doc Anok's office,

00:06:03.863 --> 00:06:06.657
I told Patpat,

00:06:07.158 --> 00:06:08.576
"Say sorry."

00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:12.830
That's what the older one does.

00:06:14.499 --> 00:06:15.500
Say sorry?

00:06:16.292 --> 00:06:20.338
D--Didn't he punch someone?

00:06:21.089 --> 00:06:23.007
That's what Mister Junior does.

00:06:23.674 --> 00:06:26.135
He calls out the younger ones.

00:06:28.096 --> 00:06:29.097
Yes.

00:06:30.348 --> 00:06:31.849
I get it.

00:06:32.767 --> 00:06:34.852
You're like Mister Junior.

00:06:37.355 --> 00:06:39.315
We like the same things.

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:42.735
That's why we should be besties.

00:06:47.448 --> 00:06:49.492
- B--Besties?
- Mm-hmm.

00:06:50.243 --> 00:06:51.577
Besties.

00:06:51.661 --> 00:06:54.831
Like best friends.

00:07:00.211 --> 00:07:01.879
Hmm.

00:07:01.963 --> 00:07:04.006
Best, best friends?

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:08.886
M--Matmat only had Dino Boy as a friend.

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:12.765
B--But now, Matmat has a best friend.

00:07:13.891 --> 00:07:20.523
Miss Mia Hernandez
is Matmat's new best friend.

00:07:20.982 --> 00:07:22.692
Just call me Mia.

00:07:22.775 --> 00:07:24.610
We're besties now.

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:29.115
What do you say, bestie?

00:07:30.575 --> 00:07:31.576
Matmat?

00:07:32.326 --> 00:07:34.078
Matmat, go take a bath.

00:07:36.247 --> 00:07:37.248
Mia.

00:07:38.541 --> 00:07:39.876
Mia, let's talk.

00:07:53.222 --> 00:07:55.308
Let's go to Montanesa?

00:07:57.059 --> 00:07:58.644
Just a quick trip. That'll do.

00:08:01.772 --> 00:08:02.773
One day?

00:08:04.025 --> 00:08:06.319
You want to escape everything in one day?

00:08:07.904 --> 00:08:09.906
You won't believe me,

00:08:09.989 --> 00:08:12.617
but to be honest, that's enough for me.

00:08:13.868 --> 00:08:15.828
I've been wanting to do that.

00:08:16.746 --> 00:08:18.706
To go on a vacation for a day.

00:08:26.881 --> 00:08:31.177
I didn't know you were a pressure cooker.

00:08:33.221 --> 00:08:34.222
Huh?

00:08:36.474 --> 00:08:38.142
You're softening me up.

00:08:42.104 --> 00:08:43.397
I should be saying that.

00:08:45.816 --> 00:08:47.193
You've changed me.

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:57.203
I can do a lot of things
now that I couldn't do before.

00:08:59.872 --> 00:09:01.332
It puzzles me…

00:09:02.542 --> 00:09:07.255
why I couldn't control my
anger when I saw you were hurt.

00:09:10.883 --> 00:09:12.134
I don't know.

00:09:12.218 --> 00:09:16.597
I think I've gone crazy.
I'm out of my mind.

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:23.854
Is that a bad thing?

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:28.901
Is it?

00:09:31.404 --> 00:09:32.321
No.

00:09:38.035 --> 00:09:39.036
For me…

00:09:41.372 --> 00:09:42.498
you are amazing.

00:10:33.382 --> 00:10:35.301
- I'll go to bed.
- Hmm.

00:10:35.384 --> 00:10:38.846
But first, I'll take a shower
before going to bed.

00:10:40.681 --> 00:10:42.475
- Let's talk tomorrow.
- Okay.

00:10:44.185 --> 00:10:45.561
- Good night.
- Good night.

00:10:46.395 --> 00:10:47.396
Okay.

00:10:50.274 --> 00:10:51.442
Good night?

00:10:59.617 --> 00:11:00.576
Hey!

00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:04.205
Hey, goat!

00:11:05.623 --> 00:11:07.792
You are ruining my life!

00:11:12.463 --> 00:11:14.548
What? You have nothing to say?

00:11:17.385 --> 00:11:20.388
Don't you dare show your face to me!

00:11:20.471 --> 00:11:21.472
Ever!

00:11:25.976 --> 00:11:27.103
Hmm.

00:11:28.145 --> 00:11:29.563
You won't drink anymore, right?

00:11:29.647 --> 00:11:32.608
Just drink tomorrow. It's late already.

00:11:32.942 --> 00:11:34.693
I can't carry you if you get wasted.

00:11:36.821 --> 00:11:38.989
I didn't say I was going to drink alcohol.

00:11:39.073 --> 00:11:40.408
I just wanted coffee.

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:42.993
Coffee?

00:11:43.702 --> 00:11:47.748
Yeah, right.
You look like you want a drink.

00:11:47.832 --> 00:11:49.625
The look in your face says,

00:11:49.708 --> 00:11:53.796
"Can I get a bucket of beer
and appetizers please?" To table 1

00:11:57.049 --> 00:11:58.968
Have you ever been in love?

00:12:01.762 --> 00:12:04.098
Yes, I've been in love.

00:12:07.101 --> 00:12:09.979
But unrequited love?

00:12:11.105 --> 00:12:12.106
Not yet.

00:12:12.815 --> 00:12:14.650
I'm not that stupid.

00:12:18.904 --> 00:12:20.698
I'll be frank with you.

00:12:20.781 --> 00:12:25.202
Patrick is so kind,
he's basically a saint.

00:12:25.286 --> 00:12:29.165
He only needs
the Pope's blessing at this point.

00:12:32.168 --> 00:12:33.544
But girl…

00:12:34.545 --> 00:12:36.755
You're on an losing streak.

00:12:36.839 --> 00:12:40.217
Not just today, but every day.

00:12:42.928 --> 00:12:45.014
- So you know?
- That you like Patrick?

00:12:45.097 --> 00:12:46.182
Yeah!

00:12:46.265 --> 00:12:48.267
It's so obvious, sis!

00:12:53.856 --> 00:12:57.276
You know, people like you…

00:12:59.361 --> 00:13:05.618
you are wasting
your love on the wrong person.

00:13:05.701 --> 00:13:08.871
It's not a waste if you're helping them.

00:13:10.164 --> 00:13:11.165
Why?

00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:17.463
Do you think helping him
will change his feelings for you?

00:13:17.838 --> 00:13:18.631
Yeah!

00:13:21.258 --> 00:13:25.429
If I could give him
what he's been looking for,

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:27.973
maybe then I'd have a chance.

00:13:29.892 --> 00:13:31.185
Oh, dear…

00:13:34.188 --> 00:13:39.652
Sis. You and I, especially you…

00:13:40.903 --> 00:13:44.031
We deserve the
kind of love only you can give.

00:13:45.324 --> 00:13:51.413
That's why I'd rather
choose someone who loves me

00:13:51.497 --> 00:13:53.040
than someone I love.

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:55.417
Isn't that unfair?

00:13:56.961 --> 00:13:57.962
No.

00:13:59.421 --> 00:14:02.800
You'll learn to love them.

00:14:04.802 --> 00:14:09.640
At least there's the
reassurance that the love you give

00:14:10.432 --> 00:14:12.935
will be reciprocated.

00:14:16.814 --> 00:14:21.527
But if you ask me,

00:14:21.610 --> 00:14:28.534
I think the guy for you is loving, kind,

00:14:28.617 --> 00:14:35.374
strong, and oozing with charisma.

00:14:35.457 --> 00:14:40.087
He can make you smile
even if he doesn't have a mustache.

00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:43.841
I feel that's the man for you!

00:14:43.924 --> 00:14:45.801
I feel it in my bones.

00:14:45.885 --> 00:14:49.763
I can even sense that…

00:14:49.847 --> 00:14:53.976
Good job, Madeth!
I can't believe you're on my side.

00:15:29.178 --> 00:15:31.347
Why did he do that

00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:33.474
if he wasn't going to go through with it?

00:15:40.856 --> 00:15:42.524
But it wasn't his fault.

00:15:43.567 --> 00:15:44.902
It was the goat's.

00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:49.073
Damn that goat.

00:16:03.295 --> 00:16:04.672
But admit it…

00:16:07.216 --> 00:16:09.760
He can't control
himself when he's around me.

00:16:13.305 --> 00:16:14.598
Next time,

00:16:15.724 --> 00:16:18.435
he won't try to stop himself.

00:16:19.353 --> 00:16:20.354
Yes.

00:16:20.854 --> 00:16:23.691
I believe that there will be a next time.

00:16:46.964 --> 00:16:49.341
You are going to love this.

00:16:50.009 --> 00:16:52.344
Your favorite oxtail stew.

00:16:53.804 --> 00:16:55.014
Let's leave now.

00:16:55.097 --> 00:16:56.890
I need to talk to Matmat.

00:16:57.307 --> 00:16:58.726
Well, call him.

00:16:58.809 --> 00:16:59.935
Now.

00:17:00.019 --> 00:17:01.562
Mia, it's not that easy.

00:17:01.645 --> 00:17:04.481
I have to remind him
about his sessions with Doc Anok.

00:17:04.565 --> 00:17:06.775
What time is it anyway?
Are you done packing?

00:17:07.192 --> 00:17:08.444
Not yet.

00:17:12.364 --> 00:17:13.449
Fine.

00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:16.285
I'll get ready.

00:17:17.911 --> 00:17:19.246
Because tomorrow,

00:17:20.247 --> 00:17:23.459
we'll finally be able to…

00:17:33.969 --> 00:17:35.804
What we're doing tomorrow…

00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:38.265
is going on a vacation.

00:17:41.935 --> 00:17:43.729
Hmph.

00:17:43.812 --> 00:17:45.481
That's what you think.

00:17:56.992 --> 00:17:58.869
Mmm, oh, oh!

00:17:58.952 --> 00:18:03.582
Patpat is o-okay.
He's sitting quietly at home.

00:18:05.209 --> 00:18:06.585
Poor kid.

00:18:08.253 --> 00:18:12.049
Hmm, if you felt bad for him,
you wouldn't have suspended him.

00:18:12.716 --> 00:18:13.884
I can't.

00:18:13.967 --> 00:18:15.427
I can't do that.

00:18:15.511 --> 00:18:17.721
You have to follow
the rules in the handbook.

00:18:19.098 --> 00:18:20.808
You're right, Doc Anok.

00:18:20.891 --> 00:18:24.770
If you do something wrong,
you should be punished.

00:18:24.853 --> 00:18:25.938
Mm-hmm.

00:18:26.563 --> 00:18:30.484
But, you know,
I understand what Patrick did.

00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:32.361
Because…

00:18:32.444 --> 00:18:37.157
that's how I felt
when Li and I were young.

00:18:40.035 --> 00:18:42.871
Mama Li? You two were a thing?

00:18:45.082 --> 00:18:47.501
Yeah. Back when I was younger,

00:18:47.584 --> 00:18:50.379
he courted me.

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:56.135
But… he's not the one you married?

00:18:56.218 --> 00:18:59.930
Doc Anok isn't, Gemma's Papa?

00:19:01.473 --> 00:19:04.852
You broke Doc's heart!

00:19:04.935 --> 00:19:07.396
You got it! You got it right!

00:19:07.479 --> 00:19:09.815
Did Patrick tell you that?

00:19:09.898 --> 00:19:14.486
Why, why did you break Doc Anok's heart?

00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:16.029
- Why did you?
- Hmm…

00:19:16.113 --> 00:19:17.239
First of all, I don't like you.

00:19:17.322 --> 00:19:20.450
Hmm, that's not what
you told me back in the day.

00:19:20.534 --> 00:19:22.536
You told me your parents were strict.

00:19:22.619 --> 00:19:24.454
- Hmm.
- Hmm?

00:19:24.538 --> 00:19:26.665
I just didn't like you before.

00:19:26.748 --> 00:19:28.792
Oh, you didn't like me before?

00:19:28.876 --> 00:19:31.336
So you like me now? Ohh!

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:33.005
- Aha!
- Uh…

00:19:33.088 --> 00:19:35.507
Answer the question!

00:19:35.591 --> 00:19:38.343
Uh…

00:19:38.427 --> 00:19:39.553
Yes?

00:19:42.222 --> 00:19:44.349
- Huh? Where?
- Oh?

00:19:45.058 --> 00:19:48.187
Papa… Please, Pa.
I don't want to leave yet.

00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:51.815
You never listen to me, Papa.

00:19:51.899 --> 00:19:53.317
That's enough, Bella!

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:55.152
I'm getting you out of here!

00:19:55.235 --> 00:19:56.528
Sir! Sir!

00:19:57.613 --> 00:20:00.240
Sir, please don't discharge Bella.

00:20:00.324 --> 00:20:02.117
Jerome followed her here.

00:20:02.826 --> 00:20:04.953
You know my daughter's case.

00:20:05.037 --> 00:20:07.080
And yet, you let it happen?

00:20:07.164 --> 00:20:09.416
Sir, Bella consented…

00:20:11.793 --> 00:20:13.587
We'll continue your treatment in the U.S.

00:20:14.296 --> 00:20:16.298
Pa. Don't do this, Pa.

00:20:16.381 --> 00:20:17.341
Stop right there!

00:20:19.259 --> 00:20:20.427
What is this commotion about?

00:20:21.178 --> 00:20:23.305
I'm getting Bella out of here.

00:20:23.388 --> 00:20:25.682
My daughter is not safe here.

00:20:25.766 --> 00:20:28.060
You can't just do that.

00:20:29.061 --> 00:20:31.063
Why? Who are you, huh?!

00:20:31.146 --> 00:20:33.357
He's the medical director here.

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:37.194
- You can only do that if--
- If what?!

00:20:38.195 --> 00:20:39.112
Huh?!

00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:45.661
Once you've paid
your remaining balance at the hospital.

00:20:45.744 --> 00:20:47.120
- Doc--
- The cashier is over there.

00:20:47.204 --> 00:20:48.497
Pogi, assist him.

00:20:49.706 --> 00:20:50.916
Come on, Bella.

00:20:52.376 --> 00:20:53.377
Bella,

00:20:54.127 --> 00:20:55.963
I'll pray for your continued recovery.

00:20:59.967 --> 00:21:01.385
Take care of Kai.

00:21:11.603 --> 00:21:12.729
Doc.

00:21:13.397 --> 00:21:14.731
Do you really think,

00:21:15.107 --> 00:21:18.110
it's okay to discharge Bella?

00:21:18.902 --> 00:21:19.945
No.

00:21:20.028 --> 00:21:22.614
Emman hasn't gotten
a chance to assist her yet.

00:21:23.907 --> 00:21:26.410
You shouldn't have approved her release.

00:21:26.493 --> 00:21:27.828
Eden.

00:21:27.911 --> 00:21:31.540
The decision falls on the patient
and their family if they want to go.

00:21:31.999 --> 00:21:35.627
No matter what advice we give,
if they want to go home,

00:21:35.711 --> 00:21:37.087
there's nothing we can do about it.

00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:39.131
- But Doc--
- Let's just hope…

00:21:39.214 --> 00:21:42.759
that Bella continues to recover,
even if she's not here anymore.

00:21:50.475 --> 00:21:52.144
Bella?!

00:21:52.227 --> 00:21:53.729
- Bella!
- Shh.

00:21:53.812 --> 00:21:55.647
Kai, Kai!

00:21:55.731 --> 00:21:59.609
Kai, if you try to force it,
you might not see Bella again.

00:21:59.693 --> 00:22:01.862
Even if you get discharged. Okay?

00:22:01.945 --> 00:22:03.530
Okay?

00:22:03.613 --> 00:22:05.115
Bella's leaving me.

00:22:05.198 --> 00:22:07.909
Calm down, calm down.
You have to keep your relationship quiet.

00:22:07.993 --> 00:22:09.661
You're going to be punished!

00:22:09.745 --> 00:22:12.122
Don't worry. I've read the future.

00:22:12.205 --> 00:22:15.167
You'll see her again.
Someone will help you, soon.

00:22:20.005 --> 00:22:23.300
What can you see?
Will her Papa bring her back?

00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:25.969
She has a different aura.

00:22:28.305 --> 00:22:30.390
She'll reveal herself very soon!

00:22:51.995 --> 00:22:53.747
- This is mine.
- That's mine!

00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:56.208
Matmat, stop it! Let go!

00:22:56.291 --> 00:22:58.251
I told you to stop it!

00:22:58.335 --> 00:23:02.005
That's the last thing
you can take from Matmat.

00:23:02.089 --> 00:23:04.633
He can't control
himself when he's around me.

00:23:04.716 --> 00:23:06.551
Come on, let's go.

00:23:06.635 --> 00:23:08.095
I'm going to make Patrick happy.

00:23:08.178 --> 00:23:11.431
The kind of
happiness that he won't forget.

00:23:11.515 --> 00:23:15.560
You can have Satsat.
But Patpat stays with Matmat.

00:23:15.644 --> 00:23:17.938
I'll find out what you're hiding.

00:23:18.021 --> 00:23:19.481
Do you remember me?

00:23:19.564 --> 00:23:21.399
Die!

00:23:21.483 --> 00:23:22.317
Protect Mia.

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:24.236
- Protect her from what?
- Where's Mia?

00:23:27.489 --> 00:23:30.367
I realized that I couldn't do this
if Matmat was here.

00:23:30.742 --> 00:23:32.410
I'm sure he'll try to stop me.

00:23:32.494 --> 00:23:34.621
I love that this was spontaneous

00:23:34.704 --> 00:23:36.832
because I get to see the fun side of you.

00:23:36.915 --> 00:23:38.959
You're cute when you smile.

00:23:39.042 --> 00:23:42.087
I'm happy to have the people in my life.

00:23:42.170 --> 00:23:44.131
I have a new bestie.

00:23:45.048 --> 00:23:46.466
I have you.

00:23:46.550 --> 00:23:48.176
You'd rather be with Miss Mia!

00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:50.053
You don't want to be with Matmat!

00:23:50.137 --> 00:23:51.596
Argh! I hate you!

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:53.765
I hate you! You want me to go away!

00:23:53.849 --> 00:23:55.851
You want me to die!
