WEBVTT

00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:03.128
- Give it!
- This is mine!

00:00:03.211 --> 00:00:06.548
- He's mine!
- Matmat, I said let go!

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:09.134
You're mean, Miss Mia!

00:00:13.471 --> 00:00:14.639
Matmat! Mia!

00:00:16.016 --> 00:00:17.058
Give me that.

00:00:18.852 --> 00:00:21.312
She already took Satsat.
What happens if…

00:00:21.396 --> 00:00:23.648
What if she also
takes the other things I have?

00:00:23.732 --> 00:00:25.734
Mia's not going to take everything.

00:00:25.817 --> 00:00:28.611
Are you sure of that, Patpat?

00:00:28.695 --> 00:00:31.906
Me. She can take everything but me.

00:00:33.241 --> 00:00:37.120
She… She can have Satsat.

00:01:32.967 --> 00:01:34.552
Gotcha!

00:01:34.636 --> 00:01:37.180
You can't hide from me.

00:01:37.263 --> 00:01:38.431
Stupid camper.

00:01:42.811 --> 00:01:44.437
Time! Time! Where are you?

00:01:44.521 --> 00:01:47.273
I'm on my way. Wait.

00:01:47.357 --> 00:01:49.359
I'm almost there. I'm here!

00:01:50.944 --> 00:01:52.195
Son of a--!

00:01:53.863 --> 00:01:57.450
Mama Li,
what did I ever do to you?!

00:01:57.534 --> 00:02:00.495
Why did you put this jerk in my room?!

00:02:03.081 --> 00:02:04.082
Be right back.

00:02:10.046 --> 00:02:11.798
You're such a pain!

00:02:11.881 --> 00:02:13.424
You ruined my game!

00:02:28.523 --> 00:02:30.817
Ow!

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.194
Perfect! This is perfect!

00:02:35.071 --> 00:02:36.281
Oh, Vincent!

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.158
Smile!

00:02:43.746 --> 00:02:47.917
That's what you get for being so annoying.

00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:49.043
Serves you right!

00:03:38.551 --> 00:03:40.136
Mia, dear.

00:03:41.137 --> 00:03:43.973
You are very special,

00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:45.642
because you,

00:03:45.725 --> 00:03:47.936
are my creation.

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:50.480
I made you.

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:53.274
My other self.

00:03:54.317 --> 00:03:55.401
No.

00:03:55.485 --> 00:03:57.987
You don't have control over me.

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:17.382
{\an8}You want to be assigned to monitor Samuel?

00:04:18.091 --> 00:04:19.175
{\an8}Wait.

00:04:19.634 --> 00:04:20.635
{\an8}Doc?

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:22.720
{\an8}A rotation?

00:04:22.804 --> 00:04:24.931
{\an8}Oh, not a rotation.

00:04:25.431 --> 00:04:28.768
{\an8}Olivia just requested
to be in charge of Samuel.

00:04:28.851 --> 00:04:32.146
{\an8}Well, can we talk about this first?

00:04:32.563 --> 00:04:33.815
{\an8}

00:04:33.898 --> 00:04:35.566
{\an8}Sure thing.

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.861
{\an8}Just let me know your decision.

00:04:38.945 --> 00:04:40.613
{\an8}I'll leave you two to talk.

00:04:40.697 --> 00:04:44.492
{\an8}

00:04:44.575 --> 00:04:45.868
{\an8}Olivia.

00:04:47.287 --> 00:04:49.998
{\an8}Is this your way of
sneaking in to become manager?

00:04:50.081 --> 00:04:52.292
{\an8}You're trying to impress Doc Anok?

00:04:53.626 --> 00:04:55.795
{\an8}I don't have time for this.

00:04:55.878 --> 00:04:58.214
{\an8}I have a lot of patients to take care of.

00:04:58.298 --> 00:04:59.966
{\an8}That's precisely my point!

00:05:00.049 --> 00:05:03.052
{\an8}You have enough patients,
and you're stealing mine?

00:05:05.888 --> 00:05:07.307
{\an8}- Oliv--
Good morning, Ma'am Eden.

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:11.269
{\an8}

00:05:11.352 --> 00:05:13.521
{\an8}

00:05:17.317 --> 00:05:18.401
{\an8}Oh!

00:05:18.484 --> 00:05:21.237
{\an8}You're looking sharp!

00:05:21.321 --> 00:05:23.781
{\an8}Really, Mama Li?
You think the clean-cut look suits me?

00:05:23.865 --> 00:05:27.410
{\an8}Yes! What finally
made you ditch the stache?

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:30.580
{\an8}Nothing much.

00:05:30.663 --> 00:05:33.958
{\an8}I just woke up feeling like shaving.

00:05:34.042 --> 00:05:37.086
- Hmm!
- Looks like it backfired.

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:40.048
It took years off your face!
You look way younger!

00:05:40.131 --> 00:05:41.424
- Really?
- Yes!

00:05:41.507 --> 00:05:42.884
As young as Gemma?

00:05:45.344 --> 00:05:48.931
{\an8}Jason, don't be so loud.
Get that bad energy off the table.

00:05:49.015 --> 00:05:50.266
{\an8}- Yeah.
Anyway…

00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:52.060
{\an8}Maybe not as young as Gemma.

00:05:52.143 --> 00:05:53.644
{\an8}My daughter's got a baby face.

00:05:53.728 --> 00:05:55.813
{\an8}Of course. Just like you!

00:05:55.897 --> 00:05:56.814
{\an8}She got it from you.

00:05:56.898 --> 00:05:58.608
{\an8}- Aww!
You also have a baby face.

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:01.694
{\an8}Seriously, Mama Li. Thank you.

00:06:01.778 --> 00:06:06.699
{\an8}Because you really do
make me feel, handsome.

00:06:06.783 --> 00:06:07.867
{\an8}

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:09.368
{\an8}- You wish.

00:06:09.452 --> 00:06:13.623
Hey, didn't I just
tell you not to be so loud?

00:06:13.706 --> 00:06:16.375
Right, Jason. Didn't you hear Mama Li?

00:06:16.459 --> 00:06:18.169
Sorry, Mama Li.

00:06:18.252 --> 00:06:21.172
I'm just making sure we're all awake.
Seems like someone's still dreaming.

00:06:21.255 --> 00:06:24.175
Oh, it's the two
ladies you should wake up.

00:06:24.258 --> 00:06:25.384
I'll do it, Mama Li!

00:06:25.468 --> 00:06:27.095
So when Gemma opens her eyes--

00:06:27.178 --> 00:06:29.680
She'll definitely throw a fit.

00:06:29.764 --> 00:06:31.766
- Good morning!
- Good morning!

00:06:31.849 --> 00:06:34.143
Here's the duo who'll ruin my love life.

00:06:34.227 --> 00:06:36.687
Mama Li, are you sure

00:06:36.771 --> 00:06:39.565
you want Gemma be
roommates with Madeth?

00:06:39.649 --> 00:06:41.692
What, like you're better?

00:06:41.776 --> 00:06:44.904
Yeah, boss.
It's been decided. I'm her roommate now.

00:06:44.987 --> 00:06:46.989
Gemma and I already talked.

00:06:47.073 --> 00:06:50.284
I told her to just
think like she gained a sister.

00:06:50.368 --> 00:06:52.078
That's perfect, Mama Li.

00:06:52.161 --> 00:06:54.539
Vincent can be my love's uncle!

00:06:54.622 --> 00:06:57.041
Hey! I can't be her uncle.

00:06:57.125 --> 00:06:58.751
I'm too young to be one.

00:06:58.835 --> 00:06:59.877
Fine.

00:06:59.961 --> 00:07:03.548
And since I'm already
an honorary family member,

00:07:03.631 --> 00:07:05.174
I'll wake Gemma up.

00:07:05.258 --> 00:07:06.676
- Bye!
- Madeth!

00:07:06.759 --> 00:07:09.178
Hey, chill out, Uncle. Watch your heart.

00:07:09.262 --> 00:07:10.555
Take it easy.

00:07:26.195 --> 00:07:27.280
Let's eat.

00:07:32.827 --> 00:07:33.911
Matmat.

00:07:33.995 --> 00:07:35.246
Sit down.

00:07:51.095 --> 00:07:52.472
How was your sleep?

00:07:56.225 --> 00:07:58.603
Probably the best I've ever had.

00:08:04.275 --> 00:08:05.234
Matmat…

00:08:11.574 --> 00:08:13.701
There's something
you want to tell Mia, right?

00:08:15.495 --> 00:08:16.496
Hmm…

00:08:17.455 --> 00:08:19.207
M-Miss Mia…

00:08:22.919 --> 00:08:24.629
I'm sorry about last night.

00:08:26.923 --> 00:08:27.965
Because…

00:08:30.676 --> 00:08:35.223
I hit you with
a pillow and pulled your hair.

00:08:42.313 --> 00:08:43.314
Mia…

00:08:54.158 --> 00:08:55.368
I'm sorry, too.

00:09:09.757 --> 00:09:11.467
Because I also hurt you.

00:09:15.763 --> 00:09:16.639
There.

00:09:17.807 --> 00:09:19.809
Now, we can start our day happy.

00:09:19.892 --> 00:09:21.102
Happy day, Matmat?

00:09:21.185 --> 00:09:24.105
Matmat didn't get hurt.

00:09:24.188 --> 00:09:27.817
But Satsat got hurt
because his head got ripped off.

00:09:28.943 --> 00:09:30.111
Matmat.

00:09:30.486 --> 00:09:33.739
It's okay, Miss Mia.

00:09:35.116 --> 00:09:37.493
You can keep Satsat.

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:47.962
But that's the last thing
you can take from Matmat.

00:09:50.923 --> 00:09:51.924
Okay?

00:10:06.355 --> 00:10:07.690
Okay?

00:10:11.527 --> 00:10:12.445
Okay.

00:10:15.823 --> 00:10:16.657
Okay.

00:10:20.119 --> 00:10:21.037
Let's eat.

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:25.291
Rice.

00:10:33.257 --> 00:10:35.217
I made sunny-side-up

00:10:35.301 --> 00:10:37.970
and scrambled eggs. It's up to you.
You can eat whichever you like.

00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:41.974
My pretty love, first
have some coffee to warm yourself up.

00:10:42.475 --> 00:10:44.185
I can manage. Thank you.

00:10:47.813 --> 00:10:49.190
Wait, wait!

00:10:49.273 --> 00:10:50.608
- There's more!
- Wait!

00:10:50.691 --> 00:10:52.568
- Oh! What's that?
- Vincent, here you go!

00:10:53.611 --> 00:10:54.862
This is my recipe.

00:10:54.945 --> 00:10:56.155
- Tapa.
- Tapa.

00:10:56.238 --> 00:10:58.324
A lot of people like my tapa.

00:10:58.407 --> 00:11:00.409
Hey, hey. I like your tapa, too.

00:11:00.493 --> 00:11:01.786
Just help yourself.

00:11:04.205 --> 00:11:05.498
It's so good, Ma!

00:11:05.581 --> 00:11:06.749
I told you.

00:11:06.832 --> 00:11:08.793
You know, if I can have
this for breakfast in Manila,

00:11:08.876 --> 00:11:11.128
I'm sure I'll be more motivated to work.

00:11:11.212 --> 00:11:14.298
Oh, wow! You're so hardworking!

00:11:14.382 --> 00:11:15.925
I like hardworking people.

00:11:16.008 --> 00:11:19.136
My daughter is hardworking, too.

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:20.596
As you know, Mama Li,

00:11:20.679 --> 00:11:24.350
I was able to build
my own business not long ago.

00:11:24.433 --> 00:11:26.018
- I even--
- Twice!

00:11:26.102 --> 00:11:27.436
I work twice as hard.

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:29.980
Because, of course,
there are employees who rely on me.

00:11:30.064 --> 00:11:32.858
Plus, I have to take
care of Mia's career, too.

00:11:32.942 --> 00:11:35.361
Wow, you have a lot on your plate.

00:11:35.444 --> 00:11:38.447
Good thing you still have
time to take care of your body.

00:11:38.531 --> 00:11:41.826
I mean, look at these broad shoulders.

00:11:41.909 --> 00:11:44.120
- So amazing!
- Thank you, Ma.

00:11:44.203 --> 00:11:45.371
Are you into swimming?

00:11:45.454 --> 00:11:46.580
Not really.

00:11:46.664 --> 00:11:48.791
Oh, Mama Li.

00:11:48.874 --> 00:11:52.211
Just so you know, I'm quite the runner.

00:11:52.294 --> 00:11:53.796
I can run pretty fast,

00:11:53.879 --> 00:11:55.798
especially when we're playing tag.

00:11:55.881 --> 00:11:57.633
I can outrun everyone.

00:11:57.716 --> 00:11:58.717
Don't you play any sports?

00:11:59.552 --> 00:12:00.886
Um…

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:02.972
- I just…
- Oh!

00:12:03.055 --> 00:12:05.349
work out in the gym three times a week.

00:12:05.433 --> 00:12:06.892
But recently,
I haven't been able to do so.

00:12:06.976 --> 00:12:10.688
No wonder you were able to carry Gemma.

00:12:11.188 --> 00:12:12.606
What?

00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:14.108
My pretty love, you let him carry you?

00:12:14.191 --> 00:12:17.570
- Cut it out.
- I can carry you, too.

00:12:17.653 --> 00:12:20.990
Ma, I thought we only
had to get along with Vincent.

00:12:21.073 --> 00:12:22.700
Yes, I'm trying to get along with him.

00:12:23.492 --> 00:12:26.912
Why does it seem like you're supporting
his efforts to make a move on me?

00:12:26.996 --> 00:12:30.708
Thank goodness
you noticed that he likes you!

00:12:30.791 --> 00:12:34.378
He has to put in extra
effort to make a move on you

00:12:34.462 --> 00:12:36.881
because all you see is Patrick!

00:12:46.307 --> 00:12:47.725
Mama Li!

00:12:47.808 --> 00:12:49.894
- Hi, Matmat!
- Ma!

00:12:50.519 --> 00:12:52.354
Let's go. Come on now.

00:12:52.438 --> 00:12:53.689
Gemma!

00:12:54.315 --> 00:12:55.274
Matmat.

00:12:55.357 --> 00:12:57.109
- Hi, Patrick. Hi, Mia.
- Hi.

00:12:57.193 --> 00:12:58.235
Hello.

00:12:58.611 --> 00:12:59.570
Hey,

00:12:59.945 --> 00:13:02.490
your hair is short now. It suits you.

00:13:03.991 --> 00:13:04.867
Thanks.

00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:06.076
I don't like it.

00:13:06.785 --> 00:13:11.123
It doesn't suit her.
Patpat shouldn't have cut her hair.

00:13:15.002 --> 00:13:18.130
I bet what you don't like,
is that he's the one who cut my hair.

00:13:21.383 --> 00:13:24.345
Matmat, like I told you,
I just helped Mia.

00:13:28.098 --> 00:13:31.101
Uh, Mia, you should
visit our house sometime.

00:13:31.185 --> 00:13:32.895
I'll cook for you.

00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:37.191
She's already been there, Mama Li.

00:13:37.274 --> 00:13:40.611
She and Gemma
even pulled each other's hair.

00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:44.490
- Matmat.
- Matmat, that doesn't count.

00:13:46.575 --> 00:13:47.535
Ma.

00:13:48.118 --> 00:13:50.329
Gemma, come on. Past is past.

00:13:50.412 --> 00:13:53.332
That was a long time ago.
You should've made up by now.

00:13:53.415 --> 00:13:55.000
- Ma, let's go.
- Huh?

00:13:55.084 --> 00:13:56.293
Patrick, we'll get going.

00:13:56.377 --> 00:13:57.711
Uh, bye.

00:13:58.629 --> 00:14:00.339
What's the hurry?

00:14:09.723 --> 00:14:11.892
Come on, let's go inside, too.

00:14:15.187 --> 00:14:18.649
We better get going
or we'll be late, Patpat.

00:14:18.732 --> 00:14:19.859
What about me?

00:14:40.087 --> 00:14:41.255
Hey!

00:14:41.338 --> 00:14:42.423
Welcome back!

00:14:44.466 --> 00:14:47.678
I thought you wouldn't
want to teach here again.

00:14:49.346 --> 00:14:51.849
I heard the patients love my stories.

00:14:52.474 --> 00:14:54.101
And you are a storyteller.

00:14:55.060 --> 00:15:00.065
I thought you only agreed because
you found out Patrick had requested it.

00:15:01.108 --> 00:15:02.359
You know,

00:15:02.443 --> 00:15:04.361
that kid is very clever.

00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:08.949
He said he'd only follow my orders
if I bring back your class.

00:15:11.994 --> 00:15:13.412
He requested for it?

00:15:14.663 --> 00:15:15.831
Uh, mm-hmm.

00:15:17.249 --> 00:15:19.043
Aside from welcoming you,

00:15:19.126 --> 00:15:20.544
I wanted to ask you a question.

00:15:21.921 --> 00:15:23.631
Do you know Zelda?

00:15:25.466 --> 00:15:26.592
Zelda?

00:15:27.593 --> 00:15:29.678
I only know one Zelda.

00:15:30.387 --> 00:15:31.889
Your patient here.

00:15:32.222 --> 00:15:33.682
She's answered in my class.

00:15:35.059 --> 00:15:36.143
Is that all?

00:15:37.061 --> 00:15:39.188
I have no interest in
finding out more about her.

00:15:40.481 --> 00:15:41.607
Fair enough.

00:15:42.316 --> 00:15:44.109
So… welcome back!

00:15:55.788 --> 00:15:58.624
He requested for me to come back.

00:16:10.302 --> 00:16:11.428
Hey!

00:16:11.512 --> 00:16:12.513
That's sweet.

00:16:15.015 --> 00:16:16.350
Do you know who left this?

00:16:17.476 --> 00:16:18.727
Did you just find that lying around?

00:16:19.436 --> 00:16:20.521
I didn't get one?

00:16:22.898 --> 00:16:24.149
Mm-hmm!

00:16:24.233 --> 00:16:25.359
Ahh…

00:16:25.442 --> 00:16:28.529
Wow, you've got a secret admirer.

00:16:29.154 --> 00:16:30.781
Feels like high school.

00:16:32.116 --> 00:16:33.200
There's two possibilities.

00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:37.621
Either they're into you
or they've got beef with you.

00:16:41.208 --> 00:16:42.835
I'm betting on Miss Mia.

00:16:43.377 --> 00:16:45.754
Wrong. It's neither of those.

00:16:46.213 --> 00:16:50.300
Still, it means someone likes you,
and now you've got a problem.

00:16:51.176 --> 00:16:53.470
Got any other problems besides her?

00:16:55.597 --> 00:16:56.849
Problem…

00:17:19.913 --> 00:17:22.332
Are you struggling, Samuel?

00:17:24.376 --> 00:17:27.838
Sometimes it's better to give up.

00:17:28.547 --> 00:17:32.384
But if you want to fight, go ahead.

00:17:32.885 --> 00:17:34.136
I'm right here.

00:17:36.638 --> 00:17:39.183
Only I can take care of you.

00:17:41.935 --> 00:17:46.774
I won't let someone
like Olivia steal you from me.

00:17:57.868 --> 00:17:58.869
Olivia.

00:17:59.453 --> 00:18:01.246
We need to talk.

00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:03.499
Don't avoid me.

00:18:06.418 --> 00:18:09.379
I won't let you steal my patient.

00:18:09.463 --> 00:18:12.549
- I'm not stealing anyone.
- You went behind my back.

00:18:12.633 --> 00:18:14.009
Isn't that stealing?

00:18:15.552 --> 00:18:20.224
I helped. That's what I did,
for the patient's sake.

00:18:21.517 --> 00:18:23.393
If you were really
concerned about the patient,

00:18:23.477 --> 00:18:27.189
you would know
continuity of care is important,

00:18:27.272 --> 00:18:30.275
especially for someone like Samuel.

00:18:30.359 --> 00:18:34.029
Samuel's used to my care,
and now you're changing it?

00:18:34.404 --> 00:18:36.365
I can care for him better.

00:18:38.033 --> 00:18:41.203
Are you saying I've been neglecting him?

00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:43.372
Isn't that what's happening?

00:18:43.789 --> 00:18:48.127
His surgery went well, he's
recovering fine so what are you implying?

00:18:49.211 --> 00:18:51.130
What about what happened with Mia?

00:18:52.422 --> 00:18:54.216
That's an isolated case.

00:18:54.299 --> 00:18:59.346
He met his daughter and
whatever the reason, when she's with him,

00:18:59.429 --> 00:19:01.223
- it's not--
- That's basically my point.

00:19:01.807 --> 00:19:04.685
If you were watching closely,
that wouldn't have happened.

00:19:04.768 --> 00:19:06.186
It wouldn't have happened,

00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:09.231
if you hadn't
insisted on bringing Mia here.

00:19:09.314 --> 00:19:13.485
Don't forget it was
your idea for Mia to care for her father.

00:19:13.569 --> 00:19:17.447
You knew my position on that
from the very beginning.

00:19:17.906 --> 00:19:21.493
Mia needs her father.
They need each other.

00:19:21.577 --> 00:19:24.705
You talk like you know them so well.

00:19:26.248 --> 00:19:27.708
You don't know anything.

00:19:28.458 --> 00:19:29.585
And you do?

00:19:32.671 --> 00:19:35.674
Do you know enough to talk like that?

00:19:35.757 --> 00:19:37.301
Do you even know them?

00:19:44.516 --> 00:19:47.936
We're their care providers. That's clear.

00:19:48.353 --> 00:19:50.856
Our priority is the patient's health,

00:19:50.939 --> 00:19:53.525
not their family relationships.

00:19:54.568 --> 00:19:55.736
And that's where we differ…

00:19:56.778 --> 00:20:00.324
because that's how I care for my patients.

00:20:00.407 --> 00:20:02.201
Then do it with your patient.

00:20:03.535 --> 00:20:04.786
Not mine.

00:22:11.788 --> 00:22:13.123
Ingrid.

00:22:13.206 --> 00:22:15.459
- Aah!

00:22:40.942 --> 00:22:43.487
- Don't you think something's--
- Stay out of it.

00:22:43.570 --> 00:22:45.322
Do you have to meddle in everything?

00:22:45.405 --> 00:22:48.408
First Samuel, then Matmat,
what's next, the whole hospital?

00:22:48.492 --> 00:22:51.953
No matter how many
times I tell myself to stay away,

00:22:52.037 --> 00:22:53.288
she still has an effect on you.

00:22:53.371 --> 00:22:55.123
What? Are you in love with Mia?

00:22:55.207 --> 00:22:58.752
When you fall in love, don't you
strive to become a better person?

00:22:58.835 --> 00:22:59.795
Bella!

00:22:59.878 --> 00:23:02.214
Only insecure men hurt women.

00:23:02.297 --> 00:23:04.800
- Stay out of this.
- Ma'am Mia! Help!
