00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.059
I knew you’d be here.

00:00:45.296 --> 00:00:47.556
Mom’s waiting, are you ready?

00:00:49.838 --> 00:00:51.838
We just came back from Dad’s funeral, King.

00:00:54.595 --> 00:00:56.595
Mom didn’t even show up.

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:02.845
But she wants us to go to someone else’s birthday party?

00:01:03.453 --> 00:01:05.014
It’s been ten years. Queen…

00:01:05.014 --> 00:01:07.868
since we last lived as a whole family.

00:01:09.003 --> 00:01:10.885
Things haven’t been the same for a long time.

00:01:15.703 --> 00:01:17.869
At first, I thought I wouldn’t feel anything about all of this.

00:01:22.276 --> 00:01:25.908
But honestly, I just couldn’t help it.

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:30.329
Well, there’s nothing strange about it.

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.329
He’s still our father, after all.

00:01:35.273 --> 00:01:36.918
It’s time, Queen.

00:01:36.918 --> 00:01:38.918
At least let Mom see you there.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.703
Happy birthday.

00:02:38.703 --> 00:02:40.703
Happy birthday, Wasin.

00:02:40.703 --> 00:02:42.092
Thank you, Poom.

00:02:42.593 --> 00:02:44.404
Thank you, Sakda.

00:02:44.404 --> 00:02:48.343
Hmm, I’ve just heard the news about your son, Sakda.

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:50.974
Your son will be running in the next election, right?

00:02:51.855 --> 00:02:53.855
That’s great! Best of luck to him.

00:02:56.313 --> 00:02:57.769
Thank you, Wasin.

00:02:57.769 --> 00:02:59.769
Word really does get around fast.

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:02.740
And what about your district?

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.533
As party leader, have you considered anyone yet?

00:03:06.533 --> 00:03:10.386
Nowadays, everyone’s after fresh, young faces in politics.

00:03:10.825 --> 00:03:12.825
That’s why I had to send my son in.

00:03:13.671 --> 00:03:15.014
Well, I’m still considering.

00:03:15.438 --> 00:03:18.100
I’ve heard a rumor, is it Queen?

00:03:20.493 --> 00:03:21.949
Word does get around fast.

00:03:22.283 --> 00:03:24.283
Oh! I totally forgot...

00:03:24.283 --> 00:03:27.313
Today was Jenphop’s cremation, wasn’t it?

00:03:27.313 --> 00:03:30.250
No wonder she wouldn’t feel comfortable at a party right now.

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:35.611
What are you gentlemen talking about?

00:03:35.611 --> 00:03:37.327
Looks like you’re having a pleasant conversation.

00:03:37.671 --> 00:03:41.019
We were just talking about your talented daughter, Kirin.

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.533
I was thinking of introducing my eldest son to her.

00:03:45.782 --> 00:03:48.964
Well, that’s rather unfortunate, Sakda.

00:03:50.288 --> 00:03:51.389
Well, I can’t deny that.

00:03:55.015 --> 00:03:57.015
There they are…

00:03:58.209 --> 00:03:59.878
King and Queen.

00:04:37.455 --> 00:04:39.833
You two must be so proud of King and Queen.

00:04:39.833 --> 00:04:41.833
They’re truly remarkable.

00:04:43.167 --> 00:04:44.541
Thank you, Sakda.

00:04:44.541 --> 00:04:45.926
Please, excuse me.

00:05:03.619 --> 00:05:08.078
King, see to the guests for me.

00:05:10.061 --> 00:05:10.879
Yes, Mom.

00:05:13.611 --> 00:05:14.854
Come here.

00:05:26.764 --> 00:05:28.102
Why are you dressed like this?

00:05:28.102 --> 00:05:29.642
Today was Dad’s cremation, Mom.

00:05:31.647 --> 00:05:33.363
You didn’t even go.

00:05:33.864 --> 00:05:35.864
But made me celebrate someone else instead.

00:05:35.864 --> 00:05:36.970
Wasin is not someone else.

00:05:38.271 --> 00:05:41.477
He’s my husband. And he’s your father.

00:05:41.477 --> 00:05:42.810
He is not my father.

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:44.612
We’ve talked about this many times, Queen.

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:47.591
Today is Wasin’s birthday.

00:05:48.031 --> 00:05:49.865
Can’t you at least save face for me?

00:05:50.337 --> 00:05:52.337
All that Queen’s perfection…

00:05:52.968 --> 00:05:54.069
where has it gone?

00:05:58.716 --> 00:06:00.014
Wasin wants you to enter politics…

00:06:00.014 --> 00:06:00.821
No, I won’t.

00:06:00.821 --> 00:06:03.008
Will you please stop controlling my life?

00:06:03.008 --> 00:06:03.508
Queen!

00:06:03.626 --> 00:06:05.398
Everything I’ve done…

00:06:05.737 --> 00:06:07.169
it’s all for you and King.

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:08.567
But I’ve never felt that way.

00:06:09.869 --> 00:06:12.318
Isn’t everything you do just for yourself?

00:06:12.318 --> 00:06:12.928
Queen!

00:06:27.412 --> 00:06:29.412
I can’t stay for the celebration.

00:06:30.211 --> 00:06:31.667
Please, enjoy the party.

00:06:32.714 --> 00:06:35.129
Queen…

00:06:35.129 --> 00:06:36.467
Get back here, now!

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:02.343
(I’m at the club with Pakinn. Come join, if you wanna chill.)

00:07:07.382 --> 00:07:08.389
Uh… Queen, where are you heading?

00:07:08.389 --> 00:07:09.165
Stay put.

00:07:37.933 --> 00:07:38.869
Queen...

00:07:38.869 --> 00:07:40.304
(Mom sent someone after me, didn’t she?)

00:07:40.304 --> 00:07:41.100
Yes.

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:42.365
Where are you heading?

00:07:42.365 --> 00:07:43.856
So I can follow…

00:07:46.876 --> 00:07:47.694
Huh…?

00:07:52.038 --> 00:07:53.234
Where did Queen go, Sam?

00:07:53.519 --> 00:07:54.266
That way…

00:07:55.331 --> 00:07:56.149
I mean…

00:07:56.149 --> 00:07:57.394
Where is Queen heading?!

00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:59.163
Ohhh…

00:08:00.581 --> 00:08:02.581
Ummm…

00:08:02.581 --> 00:08:03.767
I don’t know.

00:09:03.689 --> 00:09:04.388
Bo!

00:09:05.394 --> 00:09:06.401
Where are you off to?

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:11.321
You got some cash?

00:09:11.321 --> 00:09:12.296
I’m off to play cards.

00:09:14.776 --> 00:09:16.634
I don’t have any cash, Mom.

00:09:28.097 --> 00:09:29.529
Seriously?!

00:09:29.529 --> 00:09:31.951
You’ve got 500 and you said you’ve got no cash?!

00:09:32.398 --> 00:09:33.358
Here!

00:09:33.594 --> 00:09:35.014
Just go wherever you want!

00:09:37.924 --> 00:09:39.735
Ha! Got my stake now!

00:09:40.644 --> 00:09:42.006
Time to make some money!

00:10:07.573 --> 00:10:09.337
Geez… calling me now?!

00:10:17.499 --> 00:10:18.648
What’s up?

00:10:18.817 --> 00:10:20.912
(Where are you? Are you close?)

00:10:21.442 --> 00:10:23.229
Not yet, wait for me a bit.

00:10:23.229 --> 00:10:25.444
Hey! Make sure you have all the papers ready.

00:10:25.444 --> 00:10:26.977
I’m not riding all the way back again!

00:10:27.764 --> 00:10:29.764
(Alright, alright, alright!)

00:10:29.764 --> 00:10:31.887
(I’ve got everything this time for sure.)

00:10:32.612 --> 00:10:34.281
(Just call me when you get here.)

00:10:34.691 --> 00:10:36.691
Okay, see you. Bye.

00:10:47.283 --> 00:10:48.314
Whoa!

00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:54.082
Jeez! What’s the rush?!

00:12:30.571 --> 00:12:32.571
What happened, Queen?!

00:13:08.676 --> 00:13:09.953
You’re late again!

00:13:09.953 --> 00:13:11.253
Just a little bit!

00:13:21.314 --> 00:13:23.314
What?!

00:13:23.314 --> 00:13:24.450
You actually saw someone shooting?!

00:13:24.982 --> 00:13:26.982
Yeah! It scared the hell out of me.

00:13:26.982 --> 00:13:28.475
I can still picture it in my head!

00:13:28.839 --> 00:13:29.533
Wait?!

00:13:29.533 --> 00:13:30.695
So what did you do?!

00:13:31.132 --> 00:13:32.187
I turned this thing on…

00:13:32.187 --> 00:13:32.827
and kept honking the horn.

00:13:32.827 --> 00:13:33.970
Honked the horn…?!

00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:34.613
Yes!

00:13:34.613 --> 00:13:37.853
I literally went beep beep beep, just like that!

00:13:38.796 --> 00:13:40.212
Gosh! Bo!

00:13:40.212 --> 00:13:41.625
What were you thinking?!

00:13:42.621 --> 00:13:43.593
What if you actually died?!

00:13:43.721 --> 00:13:45.721
Whatever! I already did it anyway.

00:13:46.247 --> 00:13:48.247
Good thing they didn’t come after you.

00:13:49.379 --> 00:13:50.795
You’re right…

00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:53.033
I really shouldn’t have done that.

00:13:54.528 --> 00:13:55.805
Here…

00:13:55.805 --> 00:13:57.194
You sure you can ride back?

00:13:57.194 --> 00:13:58.721
I’ve got to get back to work now.

00:13:59.366 --> 00:14:00.282
I’m good.

00:14:00.282 --> 00:14:01.345
Just get back to work.

00:14:01.345 --> 00:14:02.298
I’m heading home now.

00:14:02.298 --> 00:14:03.373
You sure you’ve got everything?!

00:14:03.373 --> 00:14:04.033
For sure!

00:14:04.706 --> 00:14:05.428
Okay.

00:14:07.561 --> 00:14:09.116
Hey! Wait!

00:14:10.127 --> 00:14:13.195
Are you looking for a part-time job right now?

00:14:13.996 --> 00:14:14.940
What kind of work?

00:14:15.304 --> 00:14:16.915
A job I’m doing right now.

00:14:16.915 --> 00:14:21.332
Someone just quit, so Fern, my manager, and I have to find someone new.

00:14:21.332 --> 00:14:23.803
Do you need money for something right now?

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:27.467
Well, of course I always need money.

00:14:27.467 --> 00:14:29.665
But I’ve never done this kind of job before.

00:14:29.665 --> 00:14:30.913
I’m not sure I could do it.

00:14:31.803 --> 00:14:32.941
I think I’ll pass for now.

00:14:32.941 --> 00:14:35.344
At least I’ve got enough for my tuition.

00:14:35.344 --> 00:14:36.907
But anyway, thanks for asking.

00:14:37.333 --> 00:14:39.055
Alright, it’s up to you.

00:14:39.055 --> 00:14:40.988
I’ll just tell Fern to look for someone else.

00:14:42.006 --> 00:14:43.117
Go on, get back to work.

00:14:43.604 --> 00:14:44.465
Right! See you!

00:14:44.678 --> 00:14:45.622
Drive safe!

00:14:45.622 --> 00:14:47.560
And don’t go getting yourself into trouble again!

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:48.684
Call me when you get home.

00:14:49.279 --> 00:14:50.306
I know, I know.

00:14:50.422 --> 00:14:51.005
Bye-bye.

00:14:51.005 --> 00:14:51.548
Bye.

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:08.144
Can I stop now, sis?!

00:15:08.144 --> 00:15:08.714
No!

00:15:08.714 --> 00:15:11.746
Come on, sis! I’m very sorry.

00:15:20.665 --> 00:15:23.249
Queen…

00:15:30.794 --> 00:15:31.955
How are things?

00:15:34.338 --> 00:15:35.838
I’m wiped out, King.

00:15:35.838 --> 00:15:38.025
Queen didn’t even say a word to back me up!

00:15:38.424 --> 00:15:40.424
And that’s with sis still abroad!

00:15:40.918 --> 00:15:42.918
If she were right here in person…

00:15:42.918 --> 00:15:44.519
I don’t even want to imagine!

00:15:46.908 --> 00:15:48.769
Still…was it wrong of me not to follow?

00:15:48.769 --> 00:15:50.427
Queen told me to stay put.

00:15:52.623 --> 00:15:55.790
But at least Queen’s safe…

00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:58.099
Otherwise, sis would’ve totally killed me!

00:15:58.099 --> 00:15:59.116
You talk too much.

00:15:59.116 --> 00:15:59.994
Yes?!

00:16:01.304 --> 00:16:02.387
I’ll be on my way.

00:16:02.387 --> 00:16:03.262
Please excuse me.

00:16:08.267 --> 00:16:10.267
Mom and Wasin already know what happened.

00:16:11.569 --> 00:16:13.569
They’ve shut the news down…

00:16:15.098 --> 00:16:17.098
and are now looking into who’s behind it.

00:16:21.003 --> 00:16:22.169
Are you alright, Queen?

00:16:24.678 --> 00:16:25.900
I’m alright.

00:16:27.812 --> 00:16:29.812
I know you can handle things well, Queen.

00:16:29.812 --> 00:16:31.927
But with the situation right now,

00:16:31.927 --> 00:16:34.212
you need to be extra careful, okay?

00:16:39.338 --> 00:16:43.172
This is the file you sent me…

00:16:44.394 --> 00:16:46.033
and just like you said,

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:49.435
both sites come with risks.

00:16:51.255 --> 00:16:55.506
The first could lead to conflicts with the local community.

00:16:55.506 --> 00:16:59.243
The second comes with a high risk of not succeeding.

00:17:02.796 --> 00:17:04.879
It’s close to the airport, yes,

00:17:04.879 --> 00:17:06.584
but it’s outside the city,

00:17:07.102 --> 00:17:08.435
which doesn’t fit our company’s concept.

00:17:10.433 --> 00:17:13.976
It seems like we’re being pushed into choosing the local community.

00:17:16.485 --> 00:17:18.485
I recognized this problem from the beginning.

00:17:20.429 --> 00:17:23.291
I just never thought I’d be the one to step into Dad’s place.

00:17:28.458 --> 00:17:30.458
But I’ll see this project through.

00:17:33.487 --> 00:17:35.487
We still have time to find another site.

00:17:39.738 --> 00:17:43.767
But there’s another matter we need to take care of tomorrow.

00:17:46.225 --> 00:17:47.614
Mm…

00:17:48.129 --> 00:17:51.352
There’s still a lot we’ll have to go through together.

00:17:52.042 --> 00:17:53.395
It won’t be easy…

00:17:57.419 --> 00:17:59.195
but I have no doubt you can do it.

00:18:01.972 --> 00:18:03.972
I’ll always be by your side.

00:19:54.642 --> 00:19:55.641
Good morning.

00:19:57.594 --> 00:19:59.594
Allow me to address the matter directly.

00:20:00.782 --> 00:20:04.144
I’m aware of the proposal to appoint a new company president.

00:20:09.130 --> 00:20:11.130
The intention is for me to step down.

00:20:11.928 --> 00:20:13.317
Is that correct?

00:20:21.741 --> 00:20:23.915
That’s not quite the right way to put it, Keeraphat.

00:20:28.919 --> 00:20:31.530
We’re simply concerned with what is appropriate.

00:20:32.938 --> 00:20:36.550
This is the position of company president.

00:20:36.550 --> 00:20:41.720
It isn’t a position for someone who only graduated three or four years ago to step in and take lightly.

00:20:50.215 --> 00:20:52.965
Allow me to be honest with you, Keeraphat.

00:20:54.475 --> 00:20:57.275
Even with the experience you’ve gained from your father, Jenphop,

00:21:00.436 --> 00:21:02.102
we still cannot place our trust in you.

00:21:05.419 --> 00:21:07.419
I would rather support Keeta.

00:21:12.293 --> 00:21:13.376
Is that so?

00:21:13.669 --> 00:21:14.555
Definitely!

00:21:15.217 --> 00:21:18.301
Or do you think Keeta is not suitable for the position?

00:21:20.159 --> 00:21:21.548
He is your elder brother, Keeraphat.

00:21:25.323 --> 00:21:32.795
He has the potential, the experience, the knowledge, and the capability that may well exceed yours.

00:21:32.795 --> 00:21:35.050
Wouldn’t you agree, Keeta?

00:21:38.149 --> 00:21:41.177
How could you let your sister put herself ahead of you?

00:21:53.050 --> 00:21:56.523
You have our full support, Keeta.

00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:11.265
Thank you, Songpol.

00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:14.436
But I don’t see it that way.

00:22:18.823 --> 00:22:20.517
Queen and I…

00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:22.795
we’ve always walked side by side.

00:22:27.453 --> 00:22:30.398
Also, I'm more comfortable not to be in the spotlight.

00:22:31.771 --> 00:22:38.635
And I believe my little sister will definitely be a great leader for us all.

00:22:40.675 --> 00:22:42.675
But I, and the others, certainly don’t see it that way.

00:22:42.675 --> 00:22:45.941
In which every one of us here holds the right to make that decision.

00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:48.644
That’s correct.

00:22:50.796 --> 00:22:53.908
But my father’s decision should be respected.

00:23:27.232 --> 00:23:29.232
I will not step down from this position.

00:23:32.617 --> 00:23:36.174
But if one day it can be proven that I lack the capability,

00:23:38.913 --> 00:23:41.636
then a motion of no confidence may be submitted.

00:23:50.530 --> 00:23:52.600
This meeting is concluded.

00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:54.211
Thank you.

00:23:56.379 --> 00:23:58.379
Thank you all for attending this meeting.

00:24:12.337 --> 00:24:13.336
Sam, get the car ready.

00:24:13.336 --> 00:24:14.132
Yes.

00:24:16.483 --> 00:24:18.483
I’ve got another meeting to attend.

00:24:18.483 --> 00:24:19.859
Are you going home now,

00:24:19.859 --> 00:24:21.426
or staying at work a little longer?

00:24:28.608 --> 00:24:30.302
I just need to check on something.

00:24:32.014 --> 00:24:33.236
I’ll be back soon.

00:24:56.796 --> 00:24:58.073
Car keys.

00:25:00.206 --> 00:25:01.515
Here…

00:25:03.433 --> 00:25:06.322
Queen?!

00:25:09.009 --> 00:25:10.425
Where are you heading, Queen?

00:25:11.169 --> 00:25:12.780
Just around here.

00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:14.321
Stay put.

00:25:16.206 --> 00:25:17.317
Seriously?!

00:25:17.317 --> 00:25:18.172
Again?!

00:25:18.172 --> 00:25:20.897
Just around here, just around there, what’s the difference, Queen?!

00:25:20.897 --> 00:25:22.509
I’m totally going out of my mind!

00:25:37.597 --> 00:25:38.624
Did I take it out…?

00:25:44.910 --> 00:25:45.993
Yeah! Take this one.

00:25:45.993 --> 00:25:46.926
Better do it properly.

00:25:46.926 --> 00:25:48.701
Don’t you dare blame me if the price drops.

00:25:49.393 --> 00:25:50.281
Mom!

00:25:51.131 --> 00:25:52.492
And that’s another 15,000.

00:25:52.492 --> 00:25:55.313
I’m dead broke! Can’t even buy a damn meal!

00:25:55.313 --> 00:25:56.045
Mom?!

00:25:56.045 --> 00:25:57.443
Why are you taking my bike?!

00:25:57.443 --> 00:25:58.786
To pay off the damn debt!

00:25:58.786 --> 00:25:59.716
Hurry up!

00:25:59.716 --> 00:26:02.505
You’re lucky I didn’t sell it off a long time ago.

00:26:02.505 --> 00:26:03.491
Bo! What are you doing?!

00:26:03.491 --> 00:26:05.251
Mom! That’s my tuition money!

00:26:05.251 --> 00:26:05.796
So what?!

00:26:05.796 --> 00:26:07.461
Shouldn’t you be paying off my debt first?!

00:26:07.461 --> 00:26:09.164
Or you’d rather see me keep running and hiding?!

00:26:09.164 --> 00:26:11.012
We’ve got nothing left, Mom.

00:26:11.012 --> 00:26:12.396
You’re selling off everything!

00:26:12.396 --> 00:26:12.896
Yes!

00:26:12.896 --> 00:26:13.862
I’ll sell off everything!

00:26:13.862 --> 00:26:15.159
And it’s none of your damn business!

00:26:18.082 --> 00:26:19.155
Mom…

00:26:21.621 --> 00:26:22.593
I’m begging you.

00:26:22.593 --> 00:26:24.416
Please, don’t gamble anymore.

00:26:24.416 --> 00:26:26.584
I don’t know how I can keep finding money for you anymore.

00:26:26.584 --> 00:26:28.128
Bo!

00:26:28.128 --> 00:26:29.616
I’m your mother.

00:26:29.616 --> 00:26:32.299
Your damn job is to bring me money!

00:26:32.299 --> 00:26:34.049
You’ve got no right to talk to me like this!

00:26:34.049 --> 00:26:36.762
Bua!

00:26:36.762 --> 00:26:38.190
Please…

00:26:38.795 --> 00:26:39.639
just calm down first.

00:26:39.639 --> 00:26:40.692
Calm down, Kem?!

00:26:40.692 --> 00:26:41.725
Please, I beg you.

00:26:41.725 --> 00:26:42.477
Remember!

00:26:42.477 --> 00:26:44.190
You need to bring me the damn money!

00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:46.592
Let’s go, Bo.

00:26:46.592 --> 00:26:47.963
Don’t you dare even look at me!

00:26:47.963 --> 00:26:49.518
Get the hell out!

00:26:55.735 --> 00:26:56.795
Bo…

00:26:57.504 --> 00:26:58.726
Are you alright?

00:26:59.099 --> 00:27:00.627
Why did you talk to Bua like that?

00:27:02.093 --> 00:27:03.704
Mom took my tuition money,

00:27:03.704 --> 00:27:05.509
and she also sold my bike.

00:27:11.595 --> 00:27:12.761
Let’s do this, Bo…

00:27:12.761 --> 00:27:14.332
I just got some money,

00:27:14.332 --> 00:27:16.718
and already sent some to my parents.

00:27:18.751 --> 00:27:20.529
How much is your tuition?

00:27:20.529 --> 00:27:21.810
Let me help you pay for it.

00:27:21.810 --> 00:27:22.942
No, Kem.

00:27:37.565 --> 00:27:39.565
I really appreciate it.

00:27:39.565 --> 00:27:40.869
It’s really just you…

00:27:40.869 --> 00:27:42.316
who’s always there for me.

00:27:53.355 --> 00:27:54.660
Kem!

00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:56.712
I forgot my wallet at home!

00:27:58.502 --> 00:27:59.724
Wow!!!

00:28:02.136 --> 00:28:03.395
Mom! What are you doing?!

00:28:04.012 --> 00:28:04.845
Bo!

00:28:04.845 --> 00:28:07.029
You’ve got 5,000 and won’t share a thing?!

00:28:07.615 --> 00:28:08.420
Please, Mom.

00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:09.407
I’ve got nothing left.

00:28:09.407 --> 00:28:10.074
Bo!

00:28:10.074 --> 00:28:11.782
I’ll just take it to go play cards first.

00:28:11.782 --> 00:28:13.370
I’ll give it back once I get the money.

00:28:13.370 --> 00:28:14.483
Mom, please.

00:28:14.483 --> 00:28:16.286
I’ve really got nothing left.

00:28:16.286 --> 00:28:17.552
I’m begging you.

00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:19.830
Urgh! You’re annoying!

00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:20.453
Fine!

00:28:25.737 --> 00:28:27.292
I’ll give you 2,000.

00:28:28.411 --> 00:28:29.438
Is that enough?!

00:28:32.297 --> 00:28:33.547
Bo! Damn you!

00:28:33.547 --> 00:28:34.416
Bua!

00:28:34.416 --> 00:28:35.094
Calm down!

00:28:35.094 --> 00:28:36.399
She took all the money!

00:28:36.399 --> 00:28:37.413
I’ll give it to you.

00:28:37.413 --> 00:28:38.179
Give me what?!

00:28:38.179 --> 00:28:39.236
I have 6,000 with me.

00:28:39.236 --> 00:28:39.842
So?!

00:28:39.842 --> 00:28:40.686
Take this first.

00:28:40.686 --> 00:28:41.186
Okay!

00:28:41.186 --> 00:28:42.240
Hurry up!

00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:42.962
For me?

00:28:42.962 --> 00:28:44.858
Ugh! You’re so slow!

00:28:45.807 --> 00:28:47.807
Whoa! Kem!

00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:51.040
I wish I were your parents!

00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:51.836
Thanks a lot.

00:28:51.836 --> 00:28:52.659
Lock up the house for me.

00:28:52.659 --> 00:28:53.375
I’ve got to run.

00:28:54.194 --> 00:28:55.777
Damn! I even got an extra thousand.

00:28:55.777 --> 00:28:57.797
6,000?! I’m all set!

00:29:09.346 --> 00:29:10.068
Bo!

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:11.777
Bo!

00:29:14.367 --> 00:29:15.172
Bo!

00:29:28.625 --> 00:29:29.430
Bo!

00:29:40.702 --> 00:29:42.702
Bo?!

00:29:42.702 --> 00:29:43.653
Are you alright?!

00:29:43.653 --> 00:29:44.627
Are you hurt?!

00:29:45.679 --> 00:29:47.179
Watch where you’re going!

00:29:47.747 --> 00:29:49.330
Were you trying to get yourself hit?!

00:29:49.790 --> 00:29:51.595
I’m sorry, I’m so sorry.

00:29:51.595 --> 00:29:53.031
What if I couldn’t stop in time?!

00:29:53.616 --> 00:29:55.616
I’m sorry, I really am sorry.

00:29:58.651 --> 00:30:00.040
Bo, are you okay?

00:30:03.017 --> 00:30:05.017
Come on, let’s move aside.

00:30:12.125 --> 00:30:13.625
Are you hurt, Bo?

00:30:15.930 --> 00:30:16.596
No…

00:30:16.596 --> 00:30:17.428
Thanks a lot.

00:30:42.504 --> 00:30:45.452
I’ll send you my notes later.

00:30:47.139 --> 00:30:48.191
Thanks.

00:30:50.843 --> 00:30:52.619
Anyway, are you going home now?

00:30:54.862 --> 00:30:55.914
Not yet.

00:30:56.457 --> 00:30:57.983
I don’t feel like seeing my mom right now.

00:31:04.417 --> 00:31:05.619
Bo…

00:31:06.578 --> 00:31:08.578
What about your tuition?

00:31:17.789 --> 00:31:18.767
Right!

00:31:19.589 --> 00:31:22.088
Remember that job I told you about the other day?

00:31:24.618 --> 00:31:25.621
Yes.

00:31:26.761 --> 00:31:28.761
It’s a decent job with decent money,

00:31:29.215 --> 00:31:31.215
in case you’re interested.

00:31:38.650 --> 00:31:39.752
Mint!

00:31:40.656 --> 00:31:41.783
Oh! Ging!

00:31:49.568 --> 00:31:50.745
Here, I got you the chips, Mook.

00:31:50.745 --> 00:31:51.858
Exactly 10,000.

00:31:52.397 --> 00:31:54.646
Well, well, let me see…

00:31:54.646 --> 00:31:56.348
Did you get it all?

00:31:58.567 --> 00:31:59.949
Are there any missing?

00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:02.836
I’m just joking.

00:32:02.976 --> 00:32:04.976
Thanks, handsome.

00:32:06.281 --> 00:32:08.456
Here’s a little tip for you.

00:32:08.947 --> 00:32:10.299
Whoa! Mook!

00:32:10.299 --> 00:32:11.558
A whole thousand?!

00:32:11.558 --> 00:32:13.017
Thank you so much.

00:32:13.334 --> 00:32:14.711
Don’t mention it.

00:32:14.711 --> 00:32:17.038
If I win more, I’ll spoil you a little extra.

00:32:17.038 --> 00:32:17.660
Thank you.

00:32:28.533 --> 00:32:29.711
Urgh!

00:32:30.591 --> 00:32:31.669
Just take it!

00:32:35.145 --> 00:32:36.896
Here, another thousand!

00:32:36.896 --> 00:32:38.471
Come on, calm down.

00:32:38.471 --> 00:32:40.210
Calm down what?!

00:32:42.058 --> 00:32:44.058
Hurry up! I’m down to my last stack!

00:32:47.661 --> 00:32:48.988
I’m all in!

00:32:50.250 --> 00:32:51.676
Bua…

00:32:51.676 --> 00:32:52.410
Calm down.

00:32:52.410 --> 00:32:53.590
You don’t have to go all in.

00:32:53.590 --> 00:32:55.332
What the hell are you talking about?! I’m losing!

00:32:55.332 --> 00:32:56.546
Just get lost!

00:32:58.535 --> 00:32:59.912
I told you to get lost!

00:32:59.912 --> 00:33:01.805
Kem, stop bothering me!

00:33:10.402 --> 00:33:12.402
I’m so screwed.

00:33:15.927 --> 00:33:16.755
Yes?

00:33:17.611 --> 00:33:18.739
What the hell did you just do?

00:33:19.686 --> 00:33:20.763
I…um…

00:33:20.763 --> 00:33:22.362
Is that your job, huh?!

00:33:23.698 --> 00:33:25.548
If Big Boss didn’t cover your ass…

00:33:26.836 --> 00:33:28.312
you would’ve been long gone.

00:33:30.730 --> 00:33:31.633
So what?!

00:33:31.633 --> 00:33:34.266
Just because you’re good-looking, cool, and bring in customers…

00:33:34.728 --> 00:33:35.856
So what?!

00:33:39.602 --> 00:33:41.876
Forget about your bonus this month!

00:33:43.926 --> 00:33:46.973
And don’t let me catch you doing this again.

00:33:49.266 --> 00:33:50.169
Go!

00:33:50.675 --> 00:33:52.126
Get back to work!

00:33:52.903 --> 00:33:53.556
Go!

00:33:55.488 --> 00:33:56.890
I’m sorry about that.

00:34:05.815 --> 00:34:06.892
Flip the cards already.

00:34:13.275 --> 00:34:14.502
Change the damn deck, will you?

00:34:41.291 --> 00:34:42.069
Come in…

00:34:44.461 --> 00:34:45.638
Wait here.

00:34:46.125 --> 00:34:46.878
Mm.

00:34:55.957 --> 00:34:57.957
Here you go, go change.

00:34:58.981 --> 00:34:59.759
This one?

00:34:59.759 --> 00:35:00.389
Yep!

00:35:03.087 --> 00:35:04.414
Go on in.

00:35:15.791 --> 00:35:16.644
Are you serious?!

00:35:16.644 --> 00:35:17.583
Yes!

00:35:17.583 --> 00:35:18.333
Come out.

00:35:22.135 --> 00:35:24.135
Whoa! Bo!

00:35:24.615 --> 00:35:26.067
Look at you!

00:35:26.067 --> 00:35:27.011
So stunning!

00:35:28.886 --> 00:35:29.589
Really…?

00:35:29.589 --> 00:35:30.261
Yes!

00:35:31.559 --> 00:35:33.559
Don’t you think it’s a bit…?

00:35:34.113 --> 00:35:35.315
Nope!

00:35:35.315 --> 00:35:36.272
You look amazing.

00:35:39.098 --> 00:35:40.624
Whoa!

00:35:42.025 --> 00:35:43.551
Absolutely gorgeous!

00:35:44.494 --> 00:35:45.422
This is perfect.

00:35:46.563 --> 00:35:47.341
Bo.

00:35:47.341 --> 00:35:49.238
Remember this well.

00:35:49.238 --> 00:35:56.355
Our job is just to serve, pour drinks, and keep customers company.

00:35:56.355 --> 00:35:58.692
Nothing beyond that.

00:35:58.692 --> 00:36:01.227
We have strict rules here, Bo.

00:36:01.227 --> 00:36:04.538
Both staff and customers know them well.

00:36:04.538 --> 00:36:06.754
So you can rest assured.

00:36:06.754 --> 00:36:09.101
Just do your best at work.

00:36:10.151 --> 00:36:11.456
Yes, Fern.

00:36:12.135 --> 00:36:13.262
Thank you.

00:36:14.930 --> 00:36:16.007
Beautiful.

00:36:16.899 --> 00:36:17.877
Uh uh…

00:36:17.877 --> 00:36:18.624
You really are!

00:36:18.624 --> 00:36:19.577
Uh uh…

00:36:53.988 --> 00:36:55.988
I’m still going over the site details.

00:36:57.427 --> 00:36:59.901
I actually went to check out the community site today.

00:37:01.579 --> 00:37:03.055
And honestly, it seems very difficult,

00:37:04.888 --> 00:37:06.888
if everyone still insists on choosing this place.

00:37:10.599 --> 00:37:12.175
I think so too.

00:37:13.062 --> 00:37:16.284
The board also seems to be leaning toward this location,

00:37:16.284 --> 00:37:18.579
but there isn’t full agreement yet.

00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:23.380
They believe this area fits our company’s concept.

00:37:23.978 --> 00:37:26.456
By simply developing it to match the surrounding areas,

00:37:27.616 --> 00:37:29.616
the entire area could become perfect.

00:37:31.457 --> 00:37:32.983
Well, you know how it is…

00:37:32.983 --> 00:37:34.678
People always want perfection.

00:37:40.859 --> 00:37:42.709
But I really can’t figure out…

00:37:44.136 --> 00:37:46.136
if we were to drive them out of this place,

00:37:47.157 --> 00:37:48.883
where would they go?

00:37:52.903 --> 00:37:54.454
(If you don’t show up tonight…)

00:39:20.009 --> 00:39:21.036
Hey!

00:39:21.767 --> 00:39:22.619
How are you feeling?

00:39:22.619 --> 00:39:24.013
Customers are coming in.

00:39:24.013 --> 00:39:24.884
You ready?

00:39:28.972 --> 00:39:29.950
Mint…

00:39:29.950 --> 00:39:31.567
I’m actually getting nervous.

00:39:31.567 --> 00:39:33.821
Do you think I can really do this?

00:39:35.497 --> 00:39:36.456
Come on!

00:39:36.456 --> 00:39:37.576
You’ve got this.

00:39:37.576 --> 00:39:39.293
No need to be nervous.

00:39:39.293 --> 00:39:40.616
You can do it, Bo!

00:39:41.751 --> 00:39:43.202
Of course you’d say that.

00:39:43.202 --> 00:39:44.973
It’s my first day here!

00:39:48.843 --> 00:39:49.746
Come on…

00:39:49.746 --> 00:39:50.953
Don’t worry, okay?

00:39:50.953 --> 00:39:53.856
Fern and I got your back.

00:39:54.486 --> 00:39:56.062
When you turn around, you’ll see me.

00:39:56.062 --> 00:39:56.847
Okay?

00:39:59.034 --> 00:40:00.436
Okay…

00:40:02.855 --> 00:40:03.633
Wait…

00:40:09.773 --> 00:40:10.875
Wait…

00:40:11.167 --> 00:40:12.868
There’s something missing…

00:40:14.931 --> 00:40:15.934
What is it?

00:40:19.770 --> 00:40:20.748
Right!

00:40:20.748 --> 00:40:21.992
Your name tag!

00:40:24.488 --> 00:40:26.239
Not yet.

00:40:27.984 --> 00:40:29.984
It’s Bo’s first day here,

00:40:29.984 --> 00:40:31.844
but I’ll take care of it right away.

00:40:32.341 --> 00:40:33.868
Do we have to use our real name, Fern?

00:40:35.394 --> 00:40:36.322
Nope.

00:40:36.322 --> 00:40:37.735
We go by work names only.

00:40:37.735 --> 00:40:39.392
Here, check this out.

00:40:40.732 --> 00:40:41.710
Bunny…?

00:40:41.710 --> 00:40:42.441
Yes!

00:40:42.441 --> 00:40:43.636
It’s cute, right?

00:40:43.636 --> 00:40:45.828
We don’t use our real names here.

00:40:46.633 --> 00:40:48.633
It’s for our safety.

00:40:50.798 --> 00:40:52.125
So what’s my name then?

00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:01.938
Hey!

00:41:04.037 --> 00:41:05.413
Cut it out already.

00:41:05.413 --> 00:41:06.665
Just because your girl isn’t here.

00:41:06.665 --> 00:41:08.192
Can you not ruin the vibe?

00:41:21.457 --> 00:41:22.684
Anyway…

00:41:23.688 --> 00:41:25.264
You think Queen’s showing up tonight?

00:41:25.264 --> 00:41:26.622
She’s been gone since yesterday.

00:41:29.551 --> 00:41:31.152
She’ll come.

00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:32.488
Let’s do this.

00:41:33.069 --> 00:41:34.495
If she doesn’t show up.

00:41:35.631 --> 00:41:37.631
I’ll bet you a bottle,

00:41:39.037 --> 00:41:41.561
and I’ll even film myself crying outside.

00:41:41.561 --> 00:41:42.690
You’re in?

00:41:43.595 --> 00:41:44.448
I’m in!

00:41:44.904 --> 00:41:46.580
And I bet she’s definitely not going to show up.

00:41:46.580 --> 00:41:49.757
You’d better get ready to cry outside.

00:41:49.757 --> 00:41:52.547
She’ll definitely show up.

00:41:52.547 --> 00:41:53.946
She won’t.

00:41:53.946 --> 00:41:55.332
Let’s do this…

00:41:55.655 --> 00:41:57.306
I’ll just go grab the bottle right now.

00:41:57.306 --> 00:41:58.513
And you.

00:41:58.513 --> 00:42:01.448
When you go crying outside…

00:42:01.448 --> 00:42:03.994
don’t forget to post it.

00:42:07.701 --> 00:42:08.679
Please.

00:42:16.457 --> 00:42:17.310
Hey…

00:42:17.310 --> 00:42:18.070
Look.

00:42:24.537 --> 00:42:26.213
Damn it!

00:42:34.121 --> 00:42:35.148
The usual, please.

00:42:36.457 --> 00:42:37.385
Yes.

00:42:45.626 --> 00:42:47.626
Took you long enough, Queen.

00:42:50.701 --> 00:42:51.306
(Where are you???)

00:42:51.306 --> 00:42:51.902
(You have to come, Queen 🥺)

00:42:51.902 --> 00:42:52.527
(If you don’t show up,)

00:42:52.527 --> 00:42:53.501
(I’ll seriously go cry in front of the club 😩😭)

00:42:57.843 --> 00:42:59.294
Just planning to drop you.

00:43:01.007 --> 00:43:02.109
Oh, please.

00:43:02.109 --> 00:43:03.309
If you drop me…

00:43:03.309 --> 00:43:04.782
who else have you got, huh?

00:43:05.461 --> 00:43:08.658
It’s just you, me, and Pakinn these days.

00:43:12.255 --> 00:43:13.607
Where’s Pakinn?

00:43:14.013 --> 00:43:16.013
He went to get the bottle.

00:43:17.210 --> 00:43:19.210
I won the bet.

00:43:22.431 --> 00:43:24.082
And where’s the waitress?

00:43:24.082 --> 00:43:25.068
It’s Pakinn.

00:43:25.068 --> 00:43:26.232
Getting all moody,

00:43:26.232 --> 00:43:27.957
and won’t take anyone but his girl.

00:43:27.957 --> 00:43:29.561
So I just told him to go do it himself.

00:45:36.561 --> 00:45:38.561
You got this!

00:45:38.561 --> 00:45:39.363
Fighting!

00:45:53.348 --> 00:45:54.884
Did you call for me?

00:45:56.786 --> 00:45:58.786
Bring me my bottle.

00:45:58.786 --> 00:46:00.648
Under the name “Queen.”

00:46:02.253 --> 00:46:03.255
Yes.

00:46:05.024 --> 00:46:05.980
Hey, sweetie.

00:46:05.980 --> 00:46:08.958
For Queen, make it on the rocks.

00:46:08.958 --> 00:46:11.120
Just an ice ball will do.

00:46:16.719 --> 00:46:17.907
Yes.

00:46:17.907 --> 00:46:19.217
Just a moment, please.

00:46:23.544 --> 00:46:24.802
I guess she’s new,

00:46:24.802 --> 00:46:26.295
haven’t seen her before.

00:46:43.389 --> 00:46:44.600
For Queen, please.

00:46:44.600 --> 00:46:45.102
Yes.

00:46:47.229 --> 00:46:48.092
Bo!

00:46:48.092 --> 00:46:49.116
How’s it going so far?

00:46:49.116 --> 00:46:50.171
Are you good?

00:46:51.601 --> 00:46:53.114
I’m good, I guess.

00:46:56.988 --> 00:46:58.524
That customer who called for you…

00:46:58.524 --> 00:46:59.778
her name is Queen.

00:46:59.778 --> 00:47:01.340
She’s a businesswoman.

00:47:01.340 --> 00:47:04.443
You actually might know her.

00:47:04.443 --> 00:47:07.232
You always keep up with business news, don’t you?

00:47:07.232 --> 00:47:09.609
I keep up with financial news,

00:47:09.609 --> 00:47:11.714
not business news.

00:47:14.971 --> 00:47:15.973
So…

00:47:15.973 --> 00:47:16.952
That group,

00:47:16.952 --> 00:47:18.882
they’re regulars here.

00:47:18.882 --> 00:47:21.463
Queen’s pretty reserved, but nothing to worry about.

00:47:21.463 --> 00:47:24.810
As for Linn, she’s really sweet and friendly.

00:47:24.810 --> 00:47:27.598
And that guy over there…

00:47:28.670 --> 00:47:30.113
his name is Pakinn.

00:47:30.113 --> 00:47:31.691
They’re all loaded.

00:47:32.681 --> 00:47:34.681
Queen’s order is ready, Bo.

00:47:35.217 --> 00:47:36.057
Fong!

00:47:36.057 --> 00:47:37.417
That’s her real name!

00:47:37.417 --> 00:47:38.039
Whoops!

00:47:38.039 --> 00:47:39.256
But Mint, you just called me Fong.

00:47:39.256 --> 00:47:40.345
That’s my real name too!

00:47:40.345 --> 00:47:41.900
Hey! I’m Bunny!

00:47:41.900 --> 00:47:43.845
And I’m Ray.

00:47:45.330 --> 00:47:46.889
I’d better take this over now.

00:47:46.889 --> 00:47:47.994
Thank you, Ray.

00:47:47.994 --> 00:47:48.672
Sure thing.

00:47:49.323 --> 00:47:50.836
Bo, you got this!

00:48:01.575 --> 00:48:02.531
Excuse me.

00:48:05.510 --> 00:48:06.559
One more, please.

00:48:06.559 --> 00:48:07.306
One more?

00:48:07.306 --> 00:48:08.067
Yes, I’m parched.

00:48:08.067 --> 00:48:08.720
Oh! You’re parched?!

00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:09.489
Coming right up!

00:48:09.489 --> 00:48:10.455
Extra ice for me, please.

00:48:21.684 --> 00:48:22.895
Here you are.

00:48:43.130 --> 00:48:46.847
What’s your name? So I can call you properly.

00:48:50.060 --> 00:48:51.434
My name is…

00:48:51.434 --> 00:48:52.429
Babe.

00:48:53.381 --> 00:48:54.221
But…

00:48:54.221 --> 00:48:56.180
I’m called Bee at work.

00:48:58.041 --> 00:49:00.041
What do you want me to call you by then?

00:49:00.041 --> 00:49:01.958
Babe? Or Bee?

00:49:03.808 --> 00:49:05.321
Whichever you prefer.

00:49:05.321 --> 00:49:06.436
Please excuse me.

00:49:07.560 --> 00:49:08.794
Babe.

00:49:14.751 --> 00:49:16.751
I haven’t seen you before.

00:49:16.751 --> 00:49:18.390
Is this your first day here?

00:49:20.317 --> 00:49:21.691
Yes.

00:49:29.420 --> 00:49:31.234
Why are you still standing?

00:49:31.895 --> 00:49:33.106
Sit down.

00:49:35.218 --> 00:49:36.638
Where should I sit?

00:49:45.336 --> 00:49:47.127
On my lap.

00:49:51.806 --> 00:49:52.994
You mean…

00:49:52.994 --> 00:49:54.905
sit beside you, right…?

00:50:14.629 --> 00:50:16.629
Do you have your phone with you?

00:50:18.008 --> 00:50:19.289
Yes.

00:50:19.289 --> 00:50:21.000
But we’re not allowed to use it while working.

00:50:23.512 --> 00:50:25.512
I’ve reserved your time for tonight.

00:50:26.284 --> 00:50:28.284
You may use your phone.

00:50:29.635 --> 00:50:32.285
Find today’s business news and read it to me.

00:50:32.816 --> 00:50:33.818
Pardon?

00:50:35.036 --> 00:50:36.920
I said…

00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:40.994
find today’s business news and read it to me.

00:50:46.135 --> 00:50:47.416
Yes.

00:50:47.416 --> 00:50:48.472
Of course.

00:50:55.766 --> 00:50:58.300
Would you like local or international news, Queen?

00:51:00.218 --> 00:51:01.661
You choose.

00:51:04.057 --> 00:51:05.217
Alright.

00:52:25.955 --> 00:52:27.050
I found one.

00:53:01.021 --> 00:53:02.650
Why did you stop?

00:53:03.530 --> 00:53:05.530
I told you to read me the news,

00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:09.354
not sit there staring at me.

00:53:11.219 --> 00:53:13.057
I thought you’d fallen asleep.

00:53:25.595 --> 00:53:27.108
Here, take it!

00:53:27.108 --> 00:53:28.719
What did you do, Pakinn?!

00:53:28.719 --> 00:53:30.175
You were just fine a moment ago.

00:53:32.412 --> 00:53:35.085
Get me a drink, just a soda.

00:53:36.536 --> 00:53:37.538
Yes.

00:53:39.005 --> 00:53:41.005
Did you drink my bottle?!

00:53:41.005 --> 00:53:42.967
It’s half gone!

00:53:42.967 --> 00:53:44.705
I’m just in a bad mood!

00:53:45.197 --> 00:53:47.197
Cut it out already!

00:53:47.197 --> 00:53:49.055
Just because your girl didn’t show up,

00:53:49.055 --> 00:53:50.379
you just go find another one!

00:53:50.379 --> 00:53:51.407
It’s nothing, really.

00:53:51.811 --> 00:53:53.162
Easy for you to say!

00:53:53.162 --> 00:53:53.908
How’s that?

00:53:53.908 --> 00:53:56.605
It’s not easy to find someone I actually like.

00:53:56.605 --> 00:53:57.566
Jeez!

00:53:57.566 --> 00:53:59.464
I’ve called a hundred times,

00:53:59.464 --> 00:54:00.992
and she still won’t pick up!

00:54:01.450 --> 00:54:02.893
No idea where she is.

00:54:03.280 --> 00:54:04.190
Stop it already!

00:54:04.190 --> 00:54:04.991
Here’s you drink.

00:54:06.934 --> 00:54:08.331
Hey! Pakinn!

00:54:08.331 --> 00:54:09.470
You really went that far?!

00:54:10.449 --> 00:54:12.449
Pakinn, knock it off!

00:54:12.968 --> 00:54:13.947
What for?

00:54:13.947 --> 00:54:15.795
You told me to find a new girl.

00:54:16.326 --> 00:54:17.769
So I’m taking this one.

00:54:18.469 --> 00:54:19.634
Hey, cutie.

00:54:20.091 --> 00:54:21.627
You do side deals?

00:54:22.468 --> 00:54:24.468
Hey!

00:54:24.818 --> 00:54:26.215
Cut it out!

00:54:26.215 --> 00:54:27.200
Calm down!

00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:28.397
Or we’ll all be screwed.

00:54:30.803 --> 00:54:32.803
We can do it on the low.

00:54:32.803 --> 00:54:35.060
So, how much for you, cutie?

00:54:36.749 --> 00:54:37.719
Please, no.

00:54:37.719 --> 00:54:39.353
We’re not allowed to take jobs like this here.

00:54:39.353 --> 00:54:40.957
Come on, just don’t play hard to get.

00:54:40.957 --> 00:54:42.112
Please, let me go.

00:54:42.112 --> 00:54:43.052
Just come with me.

00:54:44.956 --> 00:54:46.956
What should we do, Fern?!

00:54:49.637 --> 00:54:50.802
Please, let go of me.

00:54:50.802 --> 00:54:51.953
Don’t play hard to get.

00:54:52.412 --> 00:54:53.507
Pakinn, she’s not into it.

00:54:53.507 --> 00:54:54.537
Let go of her.

00:54:55.340 --> 00:54:56.806
Stay out of this, Linn!

00:54:57.171 --> 00:54:58.289
I’ll take care of it.

00:55:00.812 --> 00:55:02.139
What if I do?

00:55:08.910 --> 00:55:11.212
Why’re you getting involved, Queen?

00:55:13.881 --> 00:55:15.881
I told you to come read me the news.

00:55:17.834 --> 00:55:18.860
Hey, Queen!

00:55:18.860 --> 00:55:20.052
We called them over…

00:55:20.052 --> 00:55:22.003
not just for you, you know!

00:55:24.463 --> 00:55:26.463
But she’ll serve only me.

00:55:34.313 --> 00:55:35.385
Come here.

00:55:59.564 --> 00:56:00.775
I’ve sold you to the den!

00:56:00.775 --> 00:56:01.703
What did you just say…?

00:56:01.703 --> 00:56:02.976
You’ll pay my debt!

00:56:05.798 --> 00:56:07.798
But if you really are getting into politics,

00:56:07.798 --> 00:56:09.014
that’s unfortunate for you…

00:56:09.014 --> 00:56:10.653
to have me as your rival.

00:56:10.653 --> 00:56:13.196
I want a rival worthy of me,

00:56:13.196 --> 00:56:14.756
not some coward lurking in the shadows.

00:56:15.025 --> 00:56:16.120
Tell me.

00:56:16.120 --> 00:56:17.812
Where do I drop you off?

00:56:17.812 --> 00:56:19.877
Does dropping me off make you feel better?

00:56:20.520 --> 00:56:21.430
Bo.

00:56:21.430 --> 00:56:22.498
You don’t have to worry at all.

00:56:22.498 --> 00:56:23.875
I already paid off Bua’s debt.

00:56:23.875 --> 00:56:25.996
I really don’t understand…

00:56:25.996 --> 00:56:27.578
Why would you go this far for me?
