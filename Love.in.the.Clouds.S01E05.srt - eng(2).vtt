{\an8}LOVE IN THE CLOUDS

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.920
{\an8}ADAPTED FROM BAI LU CHENG
SHUANG'S "LOVE IN THE CLOUDS"

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.000
YOUNG JI BOZAI

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.920
Want to eat?

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.200
Then look carefully.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.600
Even my dog is nobler than you.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.640
- Kneel, and you may eat.
- I will not kneel!

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.680
- Will you kneel or not?
- I will not!

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.960
You are nothing but a wretch

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.880
your own parents abandoned at the border.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.160
Do you understand?

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.240
Defy me again, and I will break your legs!

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:09.680
Iâ€¦

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.920
I wasn't abandoned.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.280
I wasn't!

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.160
I must get out of here alive.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:24.840
Search over there!

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.360
Don't let him escape!

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.960
EPISODE 5

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.440
The painting is right there.

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.280
There wasn't a single trap on the way.

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:35.160
The defenses are
so lax that it feels wrong.

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:37.880
I don't think the traps are absent.

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:39.880
They just haven't been triggered.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.160
They're waiting for
us to walk right into them.

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:50.560
Lord Ji,

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.880
it's my duty to protect you.

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.600
Even thunder from
the underworld should fall on me.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.040
If something happens to me,

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.360
so be it.

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.560
But if anything happens to you,

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:02.880
who will hold the household together?

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.000
Let me go in your place.

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:21.560
Go, then.

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.080
He actually let me go?

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:28.680
Unbelievable.

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:13.520
No traps at all.

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.200
Even if there's the slightest risk,

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:29.920
it should be me who takes it.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.920
Chapter 14:

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.120
"Ming Yi Takes Risks for Wealth."

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:29.320
Are you all right?

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:30.360
We got the painting.

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:34.640
That's what matters.

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:46.480
Feeling for me, aren't you?

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:00.120
More attacks?

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:01.120
Look out!

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:02.480
Are you hurt?

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:08.560
You've been struck by
a Soul-Devouring Arrow.

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:10.280
Let's head back now.

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:13.560
Lord Ji, we should take the valuables too.

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:15.120
I can buy you more later. Let's go.

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:17.760
No, we need to stage a burglary.

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:18.720
The more convincing, the better.

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:20.800
I see.

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:36.919
JUDGMENT HALL

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:41.440
The portrait of the Bo
clanswoman was stolen

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:44.000
right under your nose.

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:45.800
Situ,

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:49.800
you just took office
and already made such a blunder.

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:51.720
You must get to the bottom of this.

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:57.160
The work of the Judgment Hall
still relies on you, Lord Hanfeng.

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:00.800
Tell me what you need me to do.

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:03.440
That is what I value in
you: your tact and discernment.

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:06.400
At yesterday's banquet,
I noticed that Ji Bozai

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:08.600
showed keen interest in that painting.

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:11.960
If you can search Wugui Sea thoroughly

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:13.760
and clear Immortal Ji's name,

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:15.040
that would be best.

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:19.480
Immortal Ji is a warrior.

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:21.800
I have no solid evidence right now.

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:25.080
To storm Wugui Sea
based on flimsy suspicion would be rash.

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:26.880
If he confronts me,

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:30.520
I have neither the reason
nor the power to prevail.

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:33.320
How is that rash?

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:37.560
Searching Wugui Sea
is simply to find out if thieves broke in.

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:39.480
That's your way of protecting Immortal Ji.

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:43.000
He has spiritual veins, and I don't.

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:44.680
Who will be protecting whom?

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:45.800
Aren't you reversing our roles?

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:53.200
Didn't you just say
you would follow my orders?

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:56.800
I said you could give orders,

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:59.160
but I never
promised to carry them all out.

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:00.440
Outrageous!

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:02.200
How dare you speak
to His Lordship like that?

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:07.760
Never mind.

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:09.680
Yan Xiao.

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:11.680
You'll go.

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:15.880
Yes, Your Lordship.

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:35.960
Yan, what brings you here at this hour?

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:37.640
Ji, you might not know,

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:40.000
but the Judgment Hall
was robbed last night.

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:41.840
I've been ordered to
make routine inquiries.

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:43.640
Sorry to disturb you.

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:45.440
The Judgment Hall was robbed?

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:47.360
What does that have to do with Wugui Sea?

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:50.800
Besides, isn't there a new chief in place?

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:53.080
Talk about a dog chasing a mouse.

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:56.760
Who's the mouse here?

00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:58.480
Who's the dog, then?

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:04.440
The thief stole not only treasures

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:07.840
but also the fairy portrait
displayed at Lord Hanfeng's banquet.

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:10.280
Over that worthless thing,

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:11.360
the thief got struck by
a Soul-Devouring Arrow.

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:15.000
A new broom sweeps clean.

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:16.520
Chief Situ has ordered me

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:19.320
to investigate everyone
who saw the painting at the banquet.

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:22.120
As a humble physician, I have to
follow his orders.

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:24.600
Investigate away.

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:27.480
Help him put on the injury detector.

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:54.080
This proves

00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:57.120
I wasn't hit by
a Soul-Devouring Arrow, right?

00:11:58.080 --> 00:11:58.960
Of course.

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:00.040
It was a baseless suspicion.

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:00.960
Good.

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:06.400
Now that you've done your job,

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:07.960
I'll be on my way.

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:09.360
Please wait, Ji.

00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:11.720
One of the banquet guests,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.760
Fairy Ming Yi, hasn't been examined yet.

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:26.280
Did you wake up too
early and lose your wits?

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:28.280
Did you even hear yourself?

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:30.320
Do you really think a lowly fairy

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:32.120
can go in and out of
the Judgment Hall at will?

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:33.360
Here's the thing, Ji.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
The array at Judgment Hall's main entrance

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:37.240
was forcibly broken last night.

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:40.600
Until it's repaired,
anyone can come and go at will.

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:44.520
So Chief Situ ordered
that even fairies without spiritual veins

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:47.720
must be examined.

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:53.640
Who came so early in the morning
to spoil my plans?

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:00.480
Didn't I tell you to wait in the chamber?

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:02.160
Why did you come here?

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:06.560
I waited so long,
and you still didn't return,

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:08.440
so I grew impatient.

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:09.960
What's the hurry?

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:16.600
Fairy Ming Yi, you came just in time.

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:20.040
Immortal Yan, you're an early bird.

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:21.120
It makes sense.

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:24.400
You're a single man, so you don't know

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:27.320
that people can't bear
to be disturbed sometimes.

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:35.480
If you need to examine anything,
do it quickly.

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:36.920
Don't waste our time.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.480
This is an injury detector.

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:45.680
If you've been struck
by a Soul-Devouring Arrow,

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:47.280
it'll cause pain
that eats into your bones.

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:49.600
If not, you will feel nothing.

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:53.880
Fine. Examine me and get it over with.

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:09.080
Why so nervous?

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:11.080
I was messing with you.

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:13.240
Did you really think I sneaked
into the Judgment Hall?

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:52.000
Are you done?

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:54.360
Should we keep testing until
the next Qingyun Tournament?

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.760
Why not just go back
and tell your real master

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:00.400
to frame us outright?

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:01.560
That would be
a quicker way to get what he wants.

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:08.080
Sorry for troubling you.

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:14.280
So tiring.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:15.880
Let's head back.

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:19.600
Next time, come later.

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:30.240
As expected, Yan Xiao examined even me.

00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:32.960
- How are you feeling?
- I'm really fine, Lord Ji.

00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:36.560
Thanks to you casting a spell beforehand
to hide my wound,

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:38.240
they couldn't see I was injured.

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:40.600
All they had was
that shabby artifact to test me with.

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:43.200
And I didn't show
the slightest sign of pain.

00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:44.920
Ming Yi!

00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:44.080
Ming Yi!

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:46.160
Ming Yi!

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:51.200
I'm fine.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.600
It's just an arrow wound
and a check for injuries.

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:57.360
Every Qingyun Tournament
left me worse than this.

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:02.440
That brat Ji Bozai

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:05.359
actually let me test
the Judgment Hall's traps.

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:07.359
Truly ruthless.

00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:10.480
But

00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:13.880
if a small price like this

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:15.920
can earn his trust,

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.119
it's worth it.

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:27.520
Even though this wound

00:17:27.599 --> 00:17:29.320
has brought you closer
to the Golden Millet Dream,

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:31.600
you must never take such risks again.

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:35.640
Someone's coming. Hide, quickly!

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:36.800
All right.

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:22.200
I shouldn't have fainted.

00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:23.640
I could've applied it myself.

00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:41.040
Lord Ji.

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:46.440
If it hurts, tell me.

00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:03.400
What's wrong?

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:07.000
Every time I was hurt before,

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:09.840
I was never allowed to complain.

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:12.720
This is the first time
someone has said that to me.

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:15.800
You went through so
much at Moonlit Blossoms.

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:17.560
You'll never

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:19.920
need to go back again.

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:26.520
What medicine is this, Lord Ji?

00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:28.200
It stopped the pain so quickly.

00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:30.080
Blood-Calming Powder.

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:33.040
Blood-Calming Powder?

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:34.960
It's a rare medicine.

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:36.360
You really spared no expense.

00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:37.520
Don't move.

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:49.760
Warriors treasure
their spiritual power above all.

00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:52.400
- Lord Ji, you need not waste itâ€¦
- You were injured because of me.

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:54.120
How could I turn a blind eye?

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:04.920
What is it?

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:07.840
Is the medicine backfiring?

00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:09.840
Iâ€¦

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:13.000
I'm hungry.

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:18.240
Feel free to look around!

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:19.560
Come and take a look!

00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:21.600
- Cabbages from our own fields!
- Thank you, Lord Ji.

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:23.800
Fresh cabbages!

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:24.800
Take a look!

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:27.240
- Cheap and fresh!
- Take a look!

00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:29.240
- Come and take a look!
- Make way, please.

00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:32.200
Sir, madam, would you like some fine silk?

00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:34.440
- Take a look!
- Scented sachets!

00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:36.400
Lord Ji, this place is delightful.

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:38.360
Zhang Tai used to bring me here for fun.

00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:40.480
See those spirits?
They've all taken human form.

00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:41.480
Isn't it fascinating?

00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:42.840
- Take a look at the sachets!
- Come take a look!

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:43.760
All homegrown!

00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:44.840
- No, thanks.
- Flowers!

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:45.920
- You canâ€¦
- Immortal,

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.440
buy some flowers for the lady beside you!

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:49.160
â€¦find anything here.

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:51.280
- There's nothing you can't buy.
- Fresh flowers! Take a look!

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:53.160
GRANNY'S EATERY

00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:55.400
- You bought quite a lot this time.
- Yes.

00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:57.000
My husband asked me to.

00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:58.320
Hurry and cover it up.

00:20:58.400 --> 00:20:59.640
It won't taste good once it's cold.

00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:13.360
Madam.

00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:15.360
What would you like?

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:17.040
Two scallion pancakes.

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:19.720
Here you go.

00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:21.400
Thank you.

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:31.360
What's wrong?

00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:33.080
Aren't you hungry?

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:37.120
Scallion pancakes are
my favorite food in the world.

00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:39.600
Do you like them too, Lord Ji?

00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:42.560
You actually remembered.

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:49.600
I never forget anything.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.880
Is it really that easy to please you?

00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:00.120
It's just a pancake.

00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:04.880
Eat it before it gets cold.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:20.440
This is from Her Majesty.

00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:21.960
Scallion pancakes, your favorite.

00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:23.040
We wish you victory in the tournament.

00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:27.200
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:28.600
We'll be waiting for you!

00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:30.800
- You can do it!
- Yes.

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:33.240
Your Highness, we'll be waiting for you!

00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:37.240
I wonder how Mother is doing.

00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:39.640
I must neutralize the poison soon

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:41.480
and return to Yaoguang Mountain.

00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:46.200
Ming Yi?

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:49.000
What's wrong?

00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:55.760
Does the wound still hurt?

00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:57.560
Let me see.

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:01.800
Itâ€¦ it's healed.

00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:04.920
Oh, wellâ€¦

00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:11.640
What's the matter?

00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:16.880
Lord Ji, why are you so good to me?

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:20.040
I'm just a little fairy
from Moonlit Blossoms.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.200
Having a place to stay at Wugui Sea

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:27.160
is already a dream come true.

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:33.480
If Wugui Sea gets a true mistress one day,

00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:37.040
you'll surely cast me aside.

00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:42.840
So why even bother to remember
what I like to eat?

00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:45.200
That only feeds my wishful thinking.

00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:56.240
She actually has true feelings for me?

00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:03.720
When did I ever say I'd cast you aside?

00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:19.280
So, are you saying

00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:21.600
you won't leave me?

00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:24.680
Is that right?

00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:33.320
I understand.

00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:48.640
I won't leave you.

00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:55.120
What?

00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:11.920
Ming Yi's gamble has paid off!

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:19.480
After taking
the Moonshade Grass, Fairy Ruo Shui

00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:20.680
has recovered.

00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:30.000
Your Lordship, did you just go
to the Huansha Market with Ming Yi?

00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:36.640
While stealing the portrait for me,

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:38.360
she deliberately took other treasures

00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:40.240
to make it look more like a theft.

00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:42.840
As for the spygrass at home,
I blocked its vision with spells.

00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:45.080
The Judgment Hall found no clues,

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:46.760
so the case is closed for now.

00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:49.240
But Yan Xiao still has men watching me.

00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:51.560
I went out to let them think

00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:53.240
I spent my days in pleasure.

00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:54.480
That serves us well.

00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:57.000
- I understand, butâ€¦
- I haven't had my revenge.

00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:58.320
I have no mind for other things.

00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:19.920
I saw these medical books
while cleaning the side hall.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.040
Do they belong to the Princess?

00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:23.000
No, these are Immortal Yan's.

00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:24.520
Back when he served
at the Jade Rabbit Hall,

00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:25.880
these were his favorite books.

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:28.680
Immortal Yan?

00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:30.720
You mean Immortal Yan Xiao,
the one serving Lord Hanfeng?

00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:32.240
Yes.

00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:35.160
But doesn't the Princess despise him?

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.320
When he was a guard
at the Jade Rabbit Hall,

00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:40.800
the Princess favored him greatly.

00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:43.760
Later, he studied medicine on his own,
passed the Immortal Examination,

00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:45.560
and clung to Lord Hanfeng's power.

00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:47.360
Once he rose to prominence, he changed.

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:49.560
He even hid
His Majesty's condition from the Princess.

00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:52.920
Naturally, she came to dislike him.

00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:56.400
Your Highness,
aren't you going to visit His Majesty?

00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:57.400
Let's go.

00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:08.680
BOUNDLESS MISTY WATERS

00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:10.800
Insolence!

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:12.280
The Princess is here to see His Majesty.

00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:13.320
Step aside.

00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:15.400
His Majesty is in seclusion.

00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:17.760
No one is allowed to disturb him.
Please return, Your Highness.

00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:19.800
Father has been unconscious for so long.

00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:22.840
Whose order was this?

00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:25.840
Lord Hanfeng's?

00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:30.000
Has the Jixing Palace
already fallen under his rule?

00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:35.040
Your Highness, please go back.

00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:36.720
Today, I will see

00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:39.960
whether my words
still hold weight in this palace.

00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:42.120
Step aside!

00:27:57.680 --> 00:27:58.600
Your Highness.

00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:07.920
Those guards defied my command,

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:09.200
yet you can make them obey.

00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:12.640
His Majesty truly needs peace.

00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:15.400
Perhaps Your Highness
has been coming too often,

00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:17.360
and they feared
it would disturb His Majesty.

00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:19.480
Those servants were out of line.

00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:20.440
I will discipline them.

00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:21.800
Servants?

00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:25.040
Since when do
you have the right to call them that?

00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:30.520
Halt.

00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:32.840
Without His Majesty's permission,
no one enters.

00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:35.280
I only came to deliver books.

00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:47.520
I just want to pick them up.

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:48.480
Go ahead.

00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:12.400
RADIANT SUNLIGHT ON ALL CREATURES

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:16.880
You used to trail behind us like a dog.

00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:17.960
After reading a few medical texts,

00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:19.840
you think you can
soar to power in one leap?

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:22.520
You think you can become a physician?

00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:23.760
What a ridiculous dream!

00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:32.640
Are you here today
for the warrior selection

00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:34.680
to be held in three days, Your Highness?

00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:37.800
Thanks to your superb medical skill,

00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:39.840
my father must still be
lying unconscious, isn't he?

00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:43.160
Does the reason for my visit even matter?

00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:46.360
In the end, you are the one who decides

00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:49.040
whether he wakes to attend the selection,

00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:51.040
aren't you?

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.200
Surely you jest, Your Highness.

00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:54.160
The selection is important.

00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:55.360
His Majesty will not be absent.

00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:57.400
Then I suppose
I should thank you, Immortal Yan.

00:29:57.480 --> 00:29:59.400
And when Ji Bozai and I have our wedding,

00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:01.960
we will also have to rely on you

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:03.600
to make sure Father is present, right?

00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:07.840
With heaven's blessing,

00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:10.680
His Majesty will recover for sure.

00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:13.480
But are you certain
your wedding with Ji Bozai

00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:17.760
will truly happen?

00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:21.000
I heard
Immortal Ji already turned you down.

00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:22.600
Yes,

00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:25.400
that's what makes
it all the more challenging.

00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:29.040
I will work very hard to win his heart.

00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:35.600
So Your Highness will
marry no one else but him?

00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:38.000
Of course.

00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:39.400
Who else could I marry?

00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:40.440
You?

00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:43.360
Immortal Yan, don't flatter yourself.

00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:47.800
Once, I was deceived
by your handsome face.

00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:50.680
But now, I see

00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:52.360
that you are nothing special,

00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:56.040
even somewhat repulsive.

00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:01.040
Even if you marry Ji Bozai,

00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:04.120
it doesn't mean you will always
control the Shouhua Academy.

00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:06.320
At the end of
the day, he's just a warrior.

00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:08.840
- Why do you have toâ€¦?
- Because I like him.

00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:10.560
Don't you understand?

00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:13.640
If I didn't truly like him,

00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:15.720
why would I stake my marriage on him?

00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:17.920
If I didn't truly like him,

00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:21.760
why would I tolerate his arrogance

00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:23.040
and womanizing ways?

00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:24.560
- If I didn't trulyâ€¦
- Enough.

00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:33.080
Aren't you great at putting on an act?

00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:37.080
This isn't like you.

00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:45.680
Xiao!

00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:47.720
Xiao!

00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:51.160
Xiao!

00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:06.280
Xiao, have you been waiting long for me?

00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:08.360
I'm still not grown up yet.

00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:11.960
But when I am, I'll marry you, all right?

00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:41.720
Are you coming in or not?

00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:43.080
Haven't you played enough?

00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:48.560
Stop meowing.
If you want to come in, hurry up.

00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:51.920
I'm locking the door soon.
No waiting after that.

00:32:56.840 --> 00:32:57.920
What are you doing?

00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:07.200
Stop meowing already.

00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:09.000
- I've got news for you.
- I was talking to the cat.

00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:17.480
Guess what good news I brought back?

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:21.880
First,

00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:25.440
your younger brother Ming Xin

00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:27.040
was carried back to Yaoguang Mountain.

00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:29.480
He won't be getting out
of bed for at least a month.

00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:30.720
Really?

00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:33.240
How did he manage to
become even more useless?

00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:36.400
I've got nothing to say
about that brother of yours.

00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:37.520
Still, it works in our favor.

00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:40.520
At least no one will bother us for now.

00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:44.840
Second,

00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:52.320
this is the portrait you drew from memory.

00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:55.920
I've found out who it is.

00:33:57.040 --> 00:33:58.400
You know who it is?

00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:01.240
You'd never guess it.

00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:03.760
Stop teasing. Just tell me!

00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:05.440
All rightâ€¦

00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:07.240
I was just about to tell you.

00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:11.760
The fairy in the portrait

00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:13.719
is named Bo Yulan.

00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:17.880
She came from the Bo clan, which was
once renowned across the Six Realms

00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:20.440
for its traveling physicians.

00:34:21.719 --> 00:34:22.880
The Bo clan?

00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:25.280
The clan that created the Heavenly Grief
and Golden Millet Dream?

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.199
Exactly. The portrait's ability to move

00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:30.920
also comes from one
of the Bo clan's secret arts.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.719
I sneaked into
the Langhuan Pavilion of Jixing Abyss

00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:34.040
and checked the records.

00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:35.920
They said the Bo clan

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.159
had long lived in
seclusion on Zhangwei Mountain.

00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:42.560
But over 20 years ago,

00:34:42.639 --> 00:34:44.560
a mountain fire broke out,

00:34:44.639 --> 00:34:46.679
and the clan was nearly wiped out.

00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:49.320
Since then, there's been no trace of them.

00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:51.760
It wasn't a natural fire.

00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:52.800
Someone clearly started it

00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:54.840
to get the Heavenly Grief
and Golden Millet Dream.

00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:57.360
My master studied the Bo clan in depth.

00:34:57.440 --> 00:34:58.440
He once told me

00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:00.080
never to believe
everything written in books.

00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:02.360
The Bo clan was likely destroyed

00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:03.880
for having something others desired.

00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:06.280
Someone was after their medicine.

00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:10.400
So Ji Bozai is connected to Bo Yulan?

00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:13.440
No wonder he has the Golden Millet Dream.

00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:16.400
Does this mean he is
a descendant of the Bo clan?

00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:21.160
That would make sense.

00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:25.720
But then why was Bo Yulan's portrait
in Mu Qibai's hands?

00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:33.240
Could it be

00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:36.440
that Mu Qibai killed her?

00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:39.040
If I were Ji Bozai,

00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:40.800
I wouldn't be sitting
around eating dried fish.

00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:42.400
I'd be out for revenge.

00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:46.040
How did Ji Bozai end
up in the Sunken Abyss?

00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:52.680
There are plenty of crimes
that could send someone there.

00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:56.560
What I mean is,

00:35:57.240 --> 00:35:58.800
maybe Ji Bozai was framed.

00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:00.440
Think about it.

00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:03.000
How old was he when he was sent
to the Sunken Abyss?

00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:07.360
No one can commit crimes
before they even learn to walk, right?

00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:13.760
If Ji Bozai was framed,

00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:17.480
are the people in the Sunken Abyss
truly criminals at all?

00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:39.320
I am late.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:40.840
Please forgive me, Lord Hanfeng.

00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:42.760
What did you find out yesterday?

00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:44.600
Was Ji Bozai the one
who stole the painting?

00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:54.760
No wound from
the Soul-Devouring Arrow was found.

00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:57.520
Could there be another explanation?

00:36:58.120 --> 00:37:00.000
The Judgment Hall
lost a great deal of treasure.

00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:02.360
Perhaps the theft was really for money,

00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:04.280
not for the painting itself.

00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:06.840
I have failed in my duty.

00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:10.720
Did the spygrass you placed in Wugui Sea
catch anything?

00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:19.120
Please see for yourself.

00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:21.360
After I left Wugui Sea,

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:23.920
this is all Ji Bozai did.

00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:28.200
- Slow down, Lord Ji.
- When was I ever fast?

00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:35.320
The spygrass has been
watching him all this time,

00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:37.560
and this filth is all it recorded?

00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:42.360
Forget it.

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:45.160
The warrior selection in three days

00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:47.080
requires His Majesty's presence by law.

00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:50.560
Make sure nothing goes wrong on your end.

00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:53.120
Understood.

00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:56.520
I will take my leave.

00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:07.480
Your Lordship.

00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:10.240
Ji Bozai is likely
aware of our surveillance.

00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:12.800
Summon Xun Ming back.

00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:14.520
Understood.

00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:51.520
Master,

00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:53.360
I bow to you on my knees.

00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:07.560
I only hope

00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:11.600
you will not regret
taking me as your master today.

00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:14.760
Master, your compassion and healing arts

00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:17.360
saved my life.

00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:19.880
I will never regret it.

00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:39.480
Master,

00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:41.440
in three days,

00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:45.240
I will offer the blood of our first enemy

00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:48.880
as tribute to you.

00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:57.160
SHOUHUA ACADEMY, JIXING ABYSS

00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:04.640
WARRIOR SELECTION, JIXING ABYSS

00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:25.320
- Amazing!
- Excellent!

00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:26.440
Wonderful!

00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:35.120
Being the Chief of
Judgment Hall is such a hassle.

00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:37.280
You have to show up everywhere.

00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:39.640
The preliminaries have already started,

00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:41.320
and Ji Bozai still hasn't shown up.

00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:43.200
Can Tianji handle it alone?

00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:46.200
You should call her "the Venerable" now.

00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:48.480
Sure, in person.

00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:51.040
But we're talking in private here.

00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:53.840
Back then,
you were a guard at Tianji's palace,

00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:56.840
and I was her study companion.

00:40:56.920 --> 00:40:58.600
Given how close the three of us were,

00:40:58.680 --> 00:40:59.680
in the mortal world,

00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:02.520
we would be called
"childhood sweethearts."

00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:05.800
And their silly son.

00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:10.480
How could you be our son?

00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:13.400
Tianji and I were never like that.

00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:15.560
What are you talking about?

00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:19.400
You know what? I envy you sometimes
for being so clueless.

00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:22.040
How am I clueless?

00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:24.320
I know everything about Tianji.

00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:25.560
There are still many people

00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:27.360
who don't recognize her as the Venerable.

00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:29.200
Even if Ji Bozai doesn't show up,

00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:32.040
His Majesty will surely
come to support her, right?

00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:37.920
Rabbit candy. Your favorite.

00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:57.840
Nice move.

00:41:57.920 --> 00:41:59.480
Perfect timing for a strike.

00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:01.520
The first half of the selection is over.

00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:03.480
Please wait for the second half.

00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:09.720
Your Highness, half the rounds are done,

00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:11.600
and Immortal Ji still hasn't appeared.

00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:14.640
Immortal Ji is here.

00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:16.120
Immortal Ji is here.

00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:21.560
Who's that beside him?

00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:23.760
- That's inappropriate.
- Who's that beside him?

00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:25.640
Isn't that the fairy
from Moonlit Blossoms?

00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:27.120
He brought a female companion?

00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:28.960
That's so disrespectful to the Princess.

00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:35.440
I've heard of
your exploits before, Immortal Ji,

00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:36.960
but I didn't expect to
witness one firsthand today.

00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:40.200
Your affection is enviable.

00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:42.240
But this is a warrior selection.

00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:43.760
Do you really need a female companion?

00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:45.000
Exactly.

00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:47.040
You are embarrassing the Princess!

00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:49.360
You're wearing an amulet
your child gave you, aren't you?

00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:52.000
What? This isâ€¦

00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:54.800
She's my amulet too.
