00:18.125 --> 00:20.291
-Hi. Hi, all. Hey.
-Hi, Steve.

00:20.375 --> 00:21.500
Um…

00:21.583 --> 00:23.125
-Thanks for coming down.
-No problem.

00:23.208 --> 00:24.875
-Take a seat there.
-Okay.

00:24.958 --> 00:27.208
Angus is gonna put a mic on you.

00:27.291 --> 00:29.541
Sorry, I'm just gonna pin this to you.

00:29.625 --> 00:32.541
-Then I'll stick that in the side pocket.
-Okay.

00:32.625 --> 00:34.250
-Thank you.
-Okay.

00:34.333 --> 00:36.083
All right. Sorry about this, Steve.

00:36.166 --> 00:37.833
-It won't take a sec.
-Yeah.

00:42.750 --> 00:45.541
-We're rolling.
-I just gotta get rid of this.

00:54.500 --> 00:56.750
-You okay to do this?
-Mm-hmm.

01:02.375 --> 01:04.500
I'm probably actually not okay with it.

01:05.416 --> 01:07.833
Do you mind
if you just stop filming for a sec?

01:07.916 --> 01:09.250
-Yeah.
-Yeah, sure.

01:16.916 --> 01:19.000
-We really don't have to do this now.
-No, no, no.

01:19.083 --> 01:21.791
We should-- We should--
We're here. We should do it.

01:22.583 --> 01:23.916
-Let's do it.
-Yeah. Sure?

01:24.000 --> 01:25.125
Yep.

01:25.208 --> 01:26.458
Okay.

01:28.208 --> 01:32.041
Um… so just tell us
a bit about Stanton Wood.

01:40.166 --> 01:43.041
Ayy, ayy-ayy, ayy

01:43.666 --> 01:46.208
Ayy, ayy-ayy, ayy

01:49.333 --> 01:50.583
Okay.

01:52.458 --> 01:56.375
Uh, if Jenny wants
to stick around after her sessions,

01:56.458 --> 01:58.875
then maybe we can all have a chat.

02:01.500 --> 02:04.500
Try and get them in a room together.

02:04.583 --> 02:05.541
Um…

02:05.625 --> 02:07.333
Riley needs an intervention, Steven.

02:07.416 --> 02:09.458
Fuck's sake, never called Nabeel's dad.

02:09.541 --> 02:12.541
Okay, four, call Nabz's dad.

02:12.625 --> 02:16.166
Basically, Steven,
basically, deal with it.

02:16.250 --> 02:18.333
Get through the day. You're 48 years old.

02:18.416 --> 02:19.958
This is what human beings do.

02:20.041 --> 02:21.666
You're an adult human being.

02:21.750 --> 02:23.583
There's the big confrontation

02:23.666 --> 02:25.416
between friends and club teammates.

02:25.500 --> 02:28.333
An old family argument,
England v. Scotland,

02:28.416 --> 02:32.708
where the losers
could most certainly be out of Euro '96.

03:00.625 --> 03:02.416
Fuck! Oh, my God!

03:04.750 --> 03:06.833
-Morning, Shy.
-Wow!

03:08.583 --> 03:10.583
Stealthy Steve, you know?

03:10.666 --> 03:13.041
This isn't great, is it?

03:13.583 --> 03:15.916
-What?
-Oh, come on, Shy.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.916
Tell me you know it's not all right
to be out here at breakfast time

03:19.000 --> 03:20.416
getting fully baked.

03:23.208 --> 03:24.083
Hold this.

03:32.083 --> 03:33.125
Yeah.

03:33.208 --> 03:34.875
-What are you doing?
-No, I…

03:36.416 --> 03:38.416
Dark, yeah.

03:40.166 --> 03:43.500
-It's quite hard, isn't it?
-Hard. Yeah, so hard.

03:43.583 --> 03:47.083
I like-- I prefer when it gets
a bit more-- when it's spacier.

03:47.166 --> 03:49.166
-Spacey. Love it.
-Synths and all that.

03:49.666 --> 03:51.916
Eh, I could actually get into that.

03:54.125 --> 03:55.375
So, how are you doing?

03:56.333 --> 03:58.041
I've been worried about you.

03:58.125 --> 03:59.583
I just feel a bit more, like…

04:01.791 --> 04:05.750
barbed wire than… slippy, you know?

04:06.833 --> 04:07.666
Yeah.

04:08.541 --> 04:09.625
I hear you.

04:11.083 --> 04:15.000
You're at the top of my list today, right?
So, we'll find a time to chat.

04:17.125 --> 04:19.333
Someone pissed in my glass,
and I drank a load.

04:19.416 --> 04:21.375
It was probably Jamie.

04:21.458 --> 04:22.916
What? Was that a laugh?

04:23.000 --> 04:25.083
-No, that's terrible.
-You want piss in your mouth?

04:25.166 --> 04:28.541
You have to tell me this stuff, Shy.
It's terrible.

04:32.125 --> 04:33.000
Hey, Steve.

04:34.458 --> 04:35.500
Check this.

04:35.583 --> 04:36.458
Oh, yeah.

04:38.083 --> 04:39.791
Oh, yeah, that's a beauty, isn't it?

04:39.875 --> 04:41.750
-Yeah, man.
-Love it.

04:42.708 --> 04:43.791
No, you keep it.

04:45.916 --> 04:49.375
I'm gonna sit on the bonnet,
you drive me really slowly into school!

04:49.458 --> 04:51.750
No, absolutely not. Get off, Shy.

04:51.833 --> 04:55.041
-The film crew can film us arriving.
-What did you say?

04:55.125 --> 04:57.416
The film crew can film us arriving
when we go in.

04:57.500 --> 04:59.916
Fuck, it's Thursday!
Fuck, I'm gonna be late. Get off!

05:00.000 --> 05:01.791
-I wanna talk more!
-Get off!

05:01.875 --> 05:04.375
-Come on, Steve. Man, don't be like that.
-Shit. No, Shy.

05:04.458 --> 05:06.041
-Everyone's acting like twats--
-Get off!

05:06.125 --> 05:07.000
Get off!

05:07.083 --> 05:08.458
-Come on, man.
-Shy-- All right.

05:10.916 --> 05:13.291
All right. Get off, get off!

05:13.375 --> 05:14.375
All right!

05:17.416 --> 05:18.583
Now, listen.

05:18.666 --> 05:20.791
Sittin' on my front step
Thinking of an action

05:20.875 --> 05:21.958
-Action
-Attraction

05:22.041 --> 05:23.916
Yeah, I got my traction
With the ladies

05:24.000 --> 05:25.958
-Ladies
-Like I'm Patrick Swayze

05:26.041 --> 05:27.666
-Swayze
-I drive the girls crazy

05:27.750 --> 05:29.333
Wait, wait. Shut up. Hold on.

05:29.416 --> 05:32.083
I drive 'em all crazy, unlike Jamie
Who's a baby and a dickhead

05:32.166 --> 05:33.333
You fucking what?

05:33.416 --> 05:35.583
Hello, Posh Cal's mum.
We got Posh Cal kidnapped.

05:35.666 --> 05:37.041
He sells 50 grand, 50…

05:37.125 --> 05:39.375
Hey, 50K, mummy! 50K!

05:42.750 --> 05:44.416
Angus, won't be a sec…

05:45.833 --> 05:47.541
-Tarone, you good?
-Mm-hmm.

05:48.250 --> 05:49.958
-Owen.
-Hey, there he is.

05:50.041 --> 05:53.125
Ah, brilliant.
You must be the famous Steve.

05:53.208 --> 05:55.708
-Steve, whenever you're ready, mate.
-Yes. Okay.

05:55.791 --> 05:58.333
-Um, Steve, Kamila from Points West. Hi.
-Yeah. Hi.

05:58.416 --> 06:02.000
Boys, boys! Boys, come on.
Take it down, take it down.

06:02.083 --> 06:05.041
Jamie, give us a sec here.
Come on. Common room now.

06:05.125 --> 06:06.750
Sorry about Jamie, he just wants--

06:06.833 --> 06:09.333
Off you get, lads. Sorry. It's all right.

06:09.416 --> 06:12.041
Um, Steve, this is Geoff,
who's directing the piece.

06:12.125 --> 06:13.708
-Great to meet you.
-Wow. Directing?

06:13.791 --> 06:17.875
They said it was just kind of going to be
just about the school and what we do.

06:17.958 --> 06:20.958
You know, like, five minutes
at the end of the--

06:21.041 --> 06:22.333
I'll fucking slice you!

06:22.416 --> 06:24.333
Five minutes at the end
of the news kind of thing?

06:24.416 --> 06:28.125
Well, yeah, it's Points West,
so it is a segment after the news.

06:28.208 --> 06:30.833
-Um, but it still needs thinking about.
-Yeah.

06:30.916 --> 06:33.125
-This is Angus. He's sound.
-Hiya.

06:33.208 --> 06:36.041
-And Claire is cameras.
-Hiya. Sorry, guys, one second.

06:36.125 --> 06:37.750
-Uh, hey, Shola.
-Hi.

06:37.833 --> 06:39.041
Can I have a quick word?

06:39.125 --> 06:40.875
-Let's go to the staff room.
-Sure.

06:40.958 --> 06:44.416
Sorry, it's just crazy this morning, um…

06:45.791 --> 06:47.791
Are you, uh, all good? All good?

06:47.875 --> 06:50.083
All good, yeah, um…

06:52.958 --> 06:57.250
Actually, Steve,
can we talk about some stuff?

06:57.333 --> 06:58.833
-Tarone, you know…
-Yes.

06:59.833 --> 07:03.625
Hi, Steve. Can I quickly ask, are we good
to wander upstairs and look at some shots?

07:03.708 --> 07:06.375
-And, um, outside in the garden?
-No, no. Uh, no, no.

07:06.458 --> 07:07.583
No to the boys' rooms.

07:07.666 --> 07:10.916
Yes to wander around,
but no to the boys' rooms, if that's okay.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.958
Shola, yes, yes, 100%. Yes, we'll speak.

07:14.041 --> 07:16.208
-You're top of my list. Promise.
-Okay.

07:16.291 --> 07:18.083
Um, sorry, guys. Uh, excuse me.

07:18.166 --> 07:20.625
Get off of me, you fucking cunt!

07:20.708 --> 07:22.250
-Boys!
-I'll kill you!

07:22.333 --> 07:24.166
-Jamie! That's enough!
-I'll kill you!

07:24.250 --> 07:25.291
Riley, Riley, Riley!

07:25.375 --> 07:26.875
-What?
-Jamie!

07:26.958 --> 07:28.083
Get off me!

07:28.166 --> 07:30.041
-Come here, you pussy!
-Fuck off!

07:30.125 --> 07:32.541
-Lads, lads. Lads.
-What?

07:34.500 --> 07:36.541
Stupid fat, fucking cunt!

07:36.625 --> 07:39.416
-Riley, stop! Enough!
-Fuck off me, Steve!

07:39.500 --> 07:41.083
-Whoa. Riley.
-Come on then!

07:41.166 --> 07:42.208
No, no, no.

07:42.291 --> 07:44.166
No, come on, don't do that.

07:44.250 --> 07:46.875
-Fucking stupid cunt.
-Jamie. Jamie, come on.

07:46.958 --> 07:50.875
-You scratched my face, you little bitch.
-Fuck off, you fucking bloody homo!

07:50.958 --> 07:52.208
-Right.
-You little cunt!

07:52.291 --> 07:55.083
-I'll fucking stab you!
-Pool table privileges gone. Okay.

07:55.166 --> 07:57.166
-That's enough.
-Fucking idiot, man.

07:57.250 --> 07:58.250
Riley, Riley!

07:58.333 --> 07:59.833
Always fucking…

08:00.500 --> 08:02.583
Riley, what was that?

08:03.375 --> 08:04.500
Nah.

08:04.583 --> 08:06.916
No, man. He's a fucking sicko.

08:08.333 --> 08:11.541
Okay, let's just take it down, will we?
Use deep breaths.

08:11.625 --> 08:13.916
He's a fucking psycho, Steve. He's a cunt.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.250
You all see it,
but we have to live with him!

08:16.333 --> 08:18.583
-He's always on us every fucking day!
-No, no.

08:18.666 --> 08:21.333
Come on, you've got to relax now.
Relax, okay?

08:21.416 --> 08:26.000
You and Jamie are actually friends.
You don't know it, but you're friends.

08:26.083 --> 08:28.625
You can't keep having these little wars.
It's no use.

08:28.708 --> 08:31.625
He licked my fucking face, Steve.
He spitted in my mouth.

08:31.708 --> 08:33.041
That's sexual assault.

08:33.125 --> 08:36.708
Okay, Riley, I'm going to say something,
and you're going to roll your eyes at me.

08:36.791 --> 08:39.291
-"You're better than this, Riley."
-Yeah!

08:39.375 --> 08:41.250
I mean, that's pretty much it.

08:41.333 --> 08:45.166
But if you raise your fist at me
or another member of staff ever again,

08:45.750 --> 08:47.333
then-- then you're gone.

08:47.416 --> 08:48.500
You're out of here.

08:49.958 --> 08:52.708
Okay? I'm here for you, all right?
I'm here for you. Okay?

08:52.791 --> 08:53.625
Thanks, Steve.

08:53.708 --> 08:55.083
Right. Right, let's go.

08:56.041 --> 08:57.791
More focus, less fighting, yeah?

08:57.875 --> 08:58.708
Let's go.

08:58.791 --> 09:00.875
-Some call it a last chance.
-Oh, yeah!

09:00.958 --> 09:03.458
No, Riley. Riley, Riley!

09:03.541 --> 09:05.333
-Shit…
-Hang on. No, again.

09:05.416 --> 09:07.375
-No, I actually really liked it.
-Sorry, sorry.

09:07.458 --> 09:11.625
If you could start further back
and walk more before you start talking.

09:11.708 --> 09:12.833
We got plenty of time.

09:13.416 --> 09:15.458
Some call it a last chance.

09:15.541 --> 09:17.958
Some call it
a very expensive dumping ground

09:18.041 --> 09:20.541
for society's waste product.

09:20.625 --> 09:23.958
A radical progressive
educational intervention

09:24.041 --> 09:26.208
or a waiting room for borstal?

09:26.291 --> 09:28.916
Maybe here, at Stanton Wood Manor,

09:29.666 --> 09:31.041
it's all of the above.

09:33.125 --> 09:35.375
-Yeah.
-Yeah, that's great.

09:35.458 --> 09:37.166
Shall we try somewhere else?

09:37.250 --> 09:39.416
-Are we rolling?
-Yeah.

09:39.500 --> 09:41.916
Fuck! Shit! Cunt! Bollocks!

09:42.000 --> 09:44.416
Riley, 17.

09:44.500 --> 09:46.666
And three-quarters.

09:47.166 --> 09:50.125
And, uh,
can you describe yourself in three words?

09:50.208 --> 09:52.375
One, a Cornish legend.

09:52.458 --> 09:53.875
Two, hardcore.

09:53.958 --> 09:56.208
And three, cheeky.

09:56.291 --> 09:57.625
What did Jamie say?

09:57.708 --> 10:00.333
Jamie, uh, said,

10:01.083 --> 10:04.791
"Charismatic, uh, sexy, and irresistible."

10:06.083 --> 10:08.208
-He's such a twat.
-Last question.

10:08.291 --> 10:12.875
If 1996 Riley could say anything
to 1990 Riley, what do you think he'd say?

10:12.958 --> 10:14.083
Hello, Riley.

10:15.083 --> 10:17.208
Don't anyone ever talk down to you.

10:17.291 --> 10:19.791
Remember who you are,
and keep your fucking head up high.

10:19.875 --> 10:22.041
'Cause you're Riley, yeah?
You're fucking Riley!

10:31.583 --> 10:33.375
Fuck's sake.

10:46.916 --> 10:49.291
…that will put Jamie next to Riley.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.458
…with Jamie because that will put
Jamie next to Riley.

10:53.541 --> 10:55.583
Maybe Nabz and Shy swap.

10:57.416 --> 10:58.833
That won't fucking work.

10:58.916 --> 11:02.458
Mum, don't bother with that.
I just-- I just lost my temper.

11:02.541 --> 11:03.916
That's all it was. Like…

11:04.000 --> 11:05.708
Shy, stop talking and listen.

11:06.833 --> 11:08.708
That was not okay, Shy.

11:09.416 --> 11:11.375
I was really, really upset, and we…

11:12.166 --> 11:13.791
Iain and I, well, we just can't.

11:14.791 --> 11:16.250
It was the final straw for us.

11:16.333 --> 11:18.958
So we've decided
that while you're at Stanton Wood, we're…

11:19.708 --> 11:20.541
done.

11:26.291 --> 11:28.541
What… what are you talking about?

11:30.291 --> 11:32.125
No more phone calls or visits.

11:34.916 --> 11:37.041
What are you saying?

11:38.125 --> 11:40.875
You can't pause contact with me.
I'm your son.

11:40.958 --> 11:42.458
Shut up and listen.

11:43.541 --> 11:44.666
It's over.

11:46.625 --> 11:48.125
You ringing and screaming at me,

11:48.208 --> 11:52.041
insulting us, threatening us,
it is ruining our lives, Shy. It's over.

11:58.166 --> 11:59.625
Ruining your lives?

12:01.791 --> 12:03.416
Mum, you're insane. What?

12:04.958 --> 12:07.500
I never threatened you.
That's just what I…

12:07.583 --> 12:09.958
That's what I get like sometimes,
you know, and…

12:10.041 --> 12:11.041
Yeah, exactly.

12:12.166 --> 12:13.875
That's the point I'm making.

12:17.625 --> 12:19.458
Am… Am I dreaming this?

12:21.958 --> 12:24.125
It's for the best.
All right? For all of us.

12:26.125 --> 12:28.000
W-What if…

12:31.166 --> 12:33.166
What… what if I… I n-- I need you?

12:34.500 --> 12:36.166
Shy. I'm 17.

12:37.083 --> 12:38.666
Is Shy your real name?

12:38.750 --> 12:39.875
It is now.

12:39.958 --> 12:42.875
And if you could
describe yourself in three words?

12:43.500 --> 12:45.041
Uh, depressed.

12:45.916 --> 12:47.458
Angry and bored.

12:47.541 --> 12:49.500
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

13:04.750 --> 13:07.375
Peedy Paul, I know you hear me!

13:07.458 --> 13:08.583
-Fucking Peedy Paul!
-Nabz?

13:08.666 --> 13:10.166
I'm gonna come in
and fuckin' kill you!

13:10.250 --> 13:11.083
-Nabz.
-Huh?!

13:11.166 --> 13:14.416
He's been in there for two hours.
I'm not joking. Peedy fucking Paul!

13:14.500 --> 13:17.083
No, don't-- If you're desperate,
use the other one.

13:17.166 --> 13:20.083
Use the other loo. Paul, come on. Out.

13:21.500 --> 13:22.583
Fucking hell.

13:22.666 --> 13:27.000
Rap, jungle, drum and bass,
funky house, fashion.

13:27.500 --> 13:29.166
I'm into the ladies, I can't lie.

13:29.250 --> 13:32.000
I'm into styling.
I wouldn't mind being a model, you know?

13:32.083 --> 13:33.916
People say I can get into modelling, so…

13:34.000 --> 13:36.166
I can't really blame them.
I see where they get it from.

13:36.791 --> 13:37.666
Morning, all.

13:37.750 --> 13:40.750
-There you are, Steven. Good.
-You all right out there?

13:40.833 --> 13:42.041
-All right?
-All good.

13:42.125 --> 13:46.041
Today's a total clusterfuck.
There's no other way around it. Okay?

13:46.125 --> 13:48.416
This documentary crew
are going to be filming

13:48.500 --> 13:52.375
until at least the end of lessons now,
which is a massive help. Thanks, Steve.

13:52.458 --> 13:55.875
It's a good thing for the school.
I think it'll be a good ad. You know?

13:55.958 --> 13:57.750
-We should embrace it.
-Sure, sure.

13:57.833 --> 13:59.916
They seem like a nice bunch.
I'm fine with it.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.666
But, um, Steven, physio time.
Get yourself lying down.

14:02.750 --> 14:04.583
-Okay.
-Okay.

14:04.666 --> 14:07.041
I've told them
they've got to be done by 5:00.

14:07.125 --> 14:09.208
-And they can't interfere with lessons.
-Yeah.

14:09.291 --> 14:11.625
-You know, distract the kids. All right?
-Yeah.

14:11.708 --> 14:13.500
-Have you had your pills?
-Yes.

14:15.333 --> 14:16.416
Oh.

14:16.500 --> 14:20.250
Oh, I've just got five minutes, guys.
Then I have to go and deal with Jamie.

14:20.333 --> 14:21.166
Okay.

14:21.250 --> 14:24.916
All right, the main thing is,
11:00 a.m., we've got the trust meeting

14:25.000 --> 14:26.333
with Julian and Charlotte.

14:26.416 --> 14:27.541
Yeah, I know.

14:27.625 --> 14:29.291
Coming in and wanging on,

14:29.375 --> 14:32.666
and telling us we can't have
the heating on next winter? Okay.

14:32.750 --> 14:35.208
I'd like for us to get together
with the boys' folders

14:35.291 --> 14:37.666
and just find some time
to get up to speed, yeah?

14:37.750 --> 14:39.875
And just join the dots
on where everyone is,

14:39.958 --> 14:42.583
where Jenny's at,
and what our plans are for next term.

14:42.666 --> 14:45.041
-Let's just focus on today.
-Yes.

14:46.125 --> 14:47.166
Good speech, boss.

14:47.250 --> 14:48.500
-Woo!
-Yay!

14:48.583 --> 14:49.583
Yeah, thanks.

14:49.666 --> 14:51.750
Go on, tell us what's on the board.
Let's hear it.

14:52.333 --> 14:58.291
Well, firstly, Andy and Owen,
um, I'm sorry, but you're covering.

14:58.375 --> 15:00.333
-Today, defo, tomorrow, likely.
-Yeah.

15:00.416 --> 15:01.708
-Shola.
-Yeah?

15:01.791 --> 15:03.875
Uh, you're all set, no changes.

15:03.958 --> 15:05.958
Tarone is back in class,
back in with Jenny.

15:06.041 --> 15:07.458
If it's all right with you,

15:07.541 --> 15:09.791
he's going to be back
playing football today.

15:09.875 --> 15:12.000
Um… That's-- that's all good.

15:12.083 --> 15:15.500
If… I'll let Owen know
if there's any hassle during football.

15:15.583 --> 15:18.166
But to be honest,
once them boys see me play…

15:18.250 --> 15:19.958
Who's that? Can we help you?

15:20.041 --> 15:23.375
Yeah, just going to grab that power,
if that's okay, for my battery packs.

15:23.458 --> 15:25.500
-Uh…
-Sure.

15:25.583 --> 15:29.750
Oh, Shola, how are you, uh,
how are you getting on with your, um,

15:29.833 --> 15:32.250
Surround Sound Steve audiobooks?

15:32.333 --> 15:33.583
Has he done his tapes?

15:33.666 --> 15:35.541
Yeah. Very helpful, Steve.

15:35.625 --> 15:37.500
So, my name's Shola Marshall.

15:37.583 --> 15:39.666
I'm 28 years old.

15:40.166 --> 15:44.250
And yeah, I've been at Stanton Wood
for a little over a month now.

15:44.333 --> 15:48.791
We're asking people
to describe themselves in three words.

15:50.166 --> 15:51.708
Oh.

15:51.791 --> 15:53.541
Uh…

15:53.625 --> 15:55.708
I'd say I'm focused.

15:56.541 --> 15:58.291
Dedicated.

15:59.208 --> 16:00.041
Flexible.

16:00.125 --> 16:03.625
Now listen, remember when
they tried to get the local MP

16:03.708 --> 16:05.750
to come do a "meet the yobbos" photo call?

16:05.833 --> 16:06.833
What's his name?

16:06.916 --> 16:11.166
Uh, uh, Right Honorable Farquhar
Puts His Penis in Farmyard Animals.

16:11.250 --> 16:12.541
-Hey.
-Fuck's sake.

16:12.625 --> 16:14.500
Oh, fuck, Jamie! I got a fucking…

16:14.583 --> 16:19.125
His name, Steven, is Hugh Montague-Powell.

16:19.208 --> 16:21.041
-Mm-hmm.
-Pronounced "Pole."

16:21.125 --> 16:22.375
-I see.
-All right. Ya.

16:22.458 --> 16:24.375
Now, he's… he's coming at 12:00 p.m. today

16:24.458 --> 16:26.500
to be filmed as part
of the Points West thing.

16:26.583 --> 16:27.416
-Okay?
-Okay, fine.

16:27.500 --> 16:30.958
He's been in touch with the crew,
he's asked to be shown round the school,

16:31.041 --> 16:33.375
and we've all got to be on camera
shaking his hand,

16:33.458 --> 16:35.375
and thank him
for fucking our country in half.

16:35.458 --> 16:39.916
If 1996 Jamie could say anything
to 1990 Jamie, what would he say?

16:40.000 --> 16:42.875
Shit, we did this in English. Right.

16:44.750 --> 16:45.666
Cool.

16:46.333 --> 16:50.000
Jamie, you sexy little bastard,
give your nan a hug.

16:50.083 --> 16:52.875
Watch out for the little traitor fuckwads
and bitches in this place.

16:52.958 --> 16:54.333
Can't trust any of them.

16:54.416 --> 16:55.708
Carry a blade.

16:55.791 --> 16:58.541
You know what? Fuck the police,
you can't trust them either.

16:58.625 --> 16:59.875
Um…

16:59.958 --> 17:02.000
Don't lend Paul Howarth
your Mr. Scarface tape!

17:02.083 --> 17:04.375
-That's brilliant.
-Hold on a minute, I ain't done.

17:04.458 --> 17:08.291
Jamie, don't go to Freya's house party.
Don't do coke. You're an ecstasy man.

17:08.375 --> 17:11.708
I could write a book. Don't smoke
the squalids Nathan's brother give you.

17:11.791 --> 17:13.833
-Don't headbutt the ginger girl--
-And cut.

17:14.416 --> 17:17.750
Detractors of schools like this
will often point to the costs.

17:17.833 --> 17:24.291
After all, £30,000 per child per year
straight out of the taxpayer's pocket.

17:24.375 --> 17:29.666
Are we paying for badly behaved young men
to attend a luxury private school?

17:29.750 --> 17:34.250
Or are we investing
in radical societal surgery,

17:34.333 --> 17:37.291
turning rotten apples into valuable fruit?

17:37.791 --> 17:42.416
Critics of a place like this
will say it's too expensive,

17:42.500 --> 17:45.208
too hard to staff, too dangerous.

17:45.291 --> 17:49.083
The police are here so often,
they have a specially-assigned officer.

17:49.166 --> 17:53.000
It's always so shocking to me,
Jamie, that a man of your taste,

17:53.083 --> 17:57.208
a man of your expertise
in the field of good music,

17:57.291 --> 18:00.041
would consider Tupac a decent rapper.

18:01.416 --> 18:02.458
As if.

18:03.458 --> 18:08.291
Well, Cal-- Cal agrees with me,
Ash agrees with me, Shy agrees--

18:08.375 --> 18:11.500
Now I know you're fucking winding me up.
All right?

18:11.583 --> 18:13.833
Posh Cal knows nothing about anything.

18:13.916 --> 18:16.958
All right? Asking Ash,
that's like asking a fucking…

18:17.041 --> 18:20.083
You know? And Shy wouldn't know Tupac
from Gary fucking Barlow.

18:20.166 --> 18:23.625
-He just does whatever Benny says!
-Jamie, I'm winding you up.

18:24.333 --> 18:26.791
I get it. I agree with you.

18:27.500 --> 18:29.333
Steve, you dick.

18:29.416 --> 18:31.833
You know, Jamie, you can't--
This is the thing.

18:31.916 --> 18:35.250
You can't just casually call me
a dick and a poof all the time.

18:35.333 --> 18:37.083
You just… You can't.

18:40.083 --> 18:41.125
Fine.

18:42.375 --> 18:45.458
Fuck's sake, you win. All right?

18:46.000 --> 18:49.125
And I'm sorry for spitting
in Riley's ugly mouth.

18:51.125 --> 18:52.416
Go on.

18:54.625 --> 18:56.708
I know it's not helpful to wind Riley up,

18:56.791 --> 18:59.541
especially when I said
to you and Jenny that I wouldn't.

18:59.625 --> 19:01.041
I know you've got a busy day today,

19:01.125 --> 19:03.416
and I pick the worst moments
to start stuff.

19:03.500 --> 19:05.291
I also know I'm on my last warning,

19:05.375 --> 19:08.375
and you can't protect me
from criminal charges if it happens again.

19:08.458 --> 19:10.000
-That's it.
-Yeah.

19:10.083 --> 19:12.916
That's actually it.
And, Jamie, it's really simple.

19:13.000 --> 19:16.166
Stop fucking with Shy, okay?
'Cause you're going to break him.

19:16.250 --> 19:19.458
Stop trying to murder Riley all the time
'cause one day you'll succeed.

19:19.541 --> 19:21.500
He calls me "chubba" though, Steve.

19:21.583 --> 19:24.000
Yeah, I know. I hear you.

19:24.958 --> 19:27.625
But listen, I know a little bit
about the insult ratios in this house,

19:27.708 --> 19:29.666
and you, my friend, are top of the charts.

19:29.750 --> 19:33.583
If you give it out all the time,
sometimes you get some in return, right?

19:33.666 --> 19:34.666
It's fair enough.

19:35.791 --> 19:37.541
-Whatever.
-Whatever.

19:37.625 --> 19:41.958
Just-- just surprise us
by not always taking the bait.

19:42.458 --> 19:43.625
As if.

19:43.708 --> 19:44.708
As if.

19:46.291 --> 19:49.666
Wow, great teaching, Steve.
You're really fucking wise, aren't you?

19:51.500 --> 19:55.291
I won't give up on you, Jamie.
I'll never give up on you.

19:55.375 --> 19:57.166
Come on. Off to English now.

19:57.250 --> 20:00.250
Come on. Enough bollocks.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

20:00.333 --> 20:04.833
Right. It's, like, called the body.

20:04.916 --> 20:06.958
And it's fucking beautiful.

20:07.041 --> 20:10.833
So, we've got this. It's called the bicep.
There's two parts of it, long and short.

20:10.916 --> 20:13.541
On the back, got the triceps there.

20:13.625 --> 20:16.166
You want to see
something really fucking good?

20:16.250 --> 20:17.666
Okay.

20:17.750 --> 20:22.000
-This… is called a work of fucking art.
-Bro, why are you taking your top off?

20:22.083 --> 20:24.916
I'd taken mad, mad whizz.

20:25.000 --> 20:28.083
I was really into whizz at the time,
especially with Captain Morgan.

20:28.166 --> 20:31.375
You know, innit? You know! Good times.

20:31.458 --> 20:33.250
Anyway, to cut a long story short,

20:33.333 --> 20:36.833
um, I drove into the ticket office
of a tube station

20:36.916 --> 20:39.750
and very nearly killed
a fucking load of people, but I didn't!

20:39.833 --> 20:41.000
Original glazing.

20:41.083 --> 20:42.541
-No, they're not.
-They are.

20:42.625 --> 20:45.125
-Must be hundreds of years old.
-Yeah. Grade I listed.

20:45.208 --> 20:47.541
What does the choice
given to the knight symbolize,

20:47.625 --> 20:53.250
and how does Chaucer use irony
to develop his characters and themes?

20:53.333 --> 20:55.791
-Okay, so where were we in the prologue?
-Ash!

20:55.875 --> 20:56.916
-And who is--
-What?

20:57.000 --> 20:59.250
Riley, Ash, what's going on?

20:59.333 --> 21:01.125
-Holy shit!
-Guys.

21:02.916 --> 21:04.541
Hey!

21:04.625 --> 21:06.416
-Way too much money.
-Hang on.

21:06.500 --> 21:08.000
God, don't break them windows, mate.

21:08.083 --> 21:09.333
I'm gonna get it!

21:09.416 --> 21:11.583
-What? Oh, brilliant idea.
-They're not gonna let…

21:11.666 --> 21:13.666
-I'm getting it.
-We won't get permission.

21:17.583 --> 21:20.250
-He's fine. We can blur faces.
-It's perfect!

21:20.333 --> 21:22.000
-Bloody hell.
-Look at him.

21:23.458 --> 21:25.750
Guys. Guys!

21:25.833 --> 21:26.958
Exactly what we want.

21:27.041 --> 21:29.333
Are you actually shooting this?
They're not gonna use this.

21:29.416 --> 21:31.583
I hope this is directed at you and not me.

21:31.666 --> 21:34.708
Why do you hope
it's directed at me? That's off, Geoff.

21:34.791 --> 21:35.791
Well…

21:35.875 --> 21:37.916
You're acting like a bunch
of animals in the zoo.

21:38.000 --> 21:41.625
-Animals in a bloody zoo, innit?
-Tarone, nice to have you back.

21:41.708 --> 21:44.166
-The fuck was that for?
-Shall we get on with it?

21:47.666 --> 21:50.208
Okay, very good. Off you go. Right, Shy.

21:52.041 --> 21:53.583
-Can you hear?
-Oi, fuck off.

21:53.666 --> 21:55.125
All good here, mate?

21:57.250 --> 22:00.000
Just give me a shout
if you want to chat, okay?

22:00.083 --> 22:02.375
Okay, everybody,
ten more minutes, and then--

22:02.458 --> 22:04.333
You fucking slag!

22:18.500 --> 22:21.333
-Hey, it's them.
-Don't bite your nails.

22:21.833 --> 22:23.250
I mean, it's…

22:23.333 --> 22:26.583
What I love about this place every time,
it's like a time capsule.

22:28.000 --> 22:31.291
There they are. "Three lions on a shirt.
Jules Rimet still gleaming."

22:31.375 --> 22:32.875
Hi, Owen. How you doing?

22:32.958 --> 22:35.500
Don't worry about tea,
coffee, biscuits, no poncy stuff.

22:35.583 --> 22:36.750
No, there isn't anything.

22:36.833 --> 22:39.708
Although a glass of champagne
wouldn't go amiss. You know?

22:39.791 --> 22:42.458
Anyway, it's just…
The vibe is just terrific.

22:42.541 --> 22:44.583
Every time I come here,
it just feels like…

22:44.666 --> 22:47.208
Bosh, you know?
This is where the real action happens.

22:47.291 --> 22:50.375
Yeah. Welcome. Good to see you, Charlotte.
Julian, thanks for coming.

22:50.458 --> 22:51.916
-Of course.
-Yes.

22:52.000 --> 22:52.833
Any time.

22:52.916 --> 22:54.708
-Yeah. Julian, this meeting--
-Yes?

22:54.791 --> 22:57.833
If you could just get on with it.
I think she really wants you…

22:57.916 --> 23:01.166
-If we could-- That was rude of me.
-Yeah, sure. No, no.

23:01.250 --> 23:02.875
It's cool. No problemo. Um…

23:02.958 --> 23:07.875
Well, okay, let me just start
by saying, as always…

23:08.541 --> 23:09.916
Go, you.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.250
Steve, you know, and all you guys.

23:12.333 --> 23:17.000
What-- what you have achieved here, um…

23:17.083 --> 23:18.250
Well, the…

23:18.833 --> 23:21.333
I was just saying
to Charlotte in the car over…

23:21.416 --> 23:24.833
…what these guys have achieved is, um…

23:26.208 --> 23:28.416
I'm rambling. Charlotte, please.

23:28.958 --> 23:31.416
Yeah, um… Okay.

23:32.958 --> 23:38.958
So, we had previously talked
about two distinct phases,

23:39.041 --> 23:40.375
um, last time we met.

23:41.500 --> 23:46.291
And actually,
it seems like, for various reasons,

23:46.791 --> 23:49.791
those two phases can become one.

23:49.875 --> 23:53.000
So, Stanton Wood being on the market

23:53.083 --> 23:54.708
has meant that…

23:55.583 --> 23:56.416
Um…

23:57.000 --> 23:58.875
So we vacate the site in December.

23:58.958 --> 24:01.375
Sorry, can I just stop you there
for a second? Um…

24:01.458 --> 24:04.083
-What are you… What are you saying?
-What?

24:04.166 --> 24:07.458
-Are you-- What are you saying?
-"Vacate the site"?

24:07.541 --> 24:10.333
Are you talking about the trust
selling the school?

24:10.916 --> 24:12.041
Um…

24:13.041 --> 24:13.875
Yes.

24:15.958 --> 24:18.833
What's happened is
that we've been able to--

24:18.916 --> 24:20.250
Wait. No, wait a second.

24:20.333 --> 24:22.875
I can't really believe
what I'm hearing here, so…

24:23.541 --> 24:25.541
Wait a second. We have--

24:25.625 --> 24:27.708
You guys have, on various occasions,

24:27.791 --> 24:31.500
speculatively discussed
how a-- a-- a closure

24:31.583 --> 24:33.875
might be approached
long-term, logistically.

24:33.958 --> 24:35.458
That's it. Yeah?

24:36.083 --> 24:37.208
-Is that true?
-Yeah.

24:37.291 --> 24:39.541
-Yeah.
-Right? Now you say, all of a sudden…

24:39.625 --> 24:42.125
What?
You're just saying you're just doing it?

24:42.208 --> 24:43.791
Am I…?

24:43.875 --> 24:49.000
Charlotte, you said… you said, uh,
um, vacate the site in… in December.

24:49.083 --> 24:50.750
So, are you… are you…

24:51.875 --> 24:54.833
are you talking about closing the school
in… in less than 18 months' time?

24:54.916 --> 24:56.375
-Is that what you're saying?
-My God.

24:56.458 --> 24:57.791
Um…

24:57.875 --> 25:00.000
Um… Steve…

25:00.541 --> 25:04.333
We're talking about December 1996.

25:04.416 --> 25:06.333
-We're going to be, um…
-What six months' time?

25:06.416 --> 25:09.541
-In the middle of the school year?
-Okay! Okay, okay, guys.

25:09.625 --> 25:11.625
-You're kidding me!
-If you could just let me speak.

25:11.708 --> 25:13.291
If you could just let me speak.

25:13.375 --> 25:15.833
Tell us a bit about Stanton Wood.

25:15.916 --> 25:17.791
It's sort of like a prototype, you know?

25:17.875 --> 25:20.458
To bring kind of more
of a rehabilitative approach to…

25:20.541 --> 25:23.750
to residential schooling, you know?
It's based off a Finnish model, actually.

25:23.833 --> 25:26.333
Sorry, Steve. Sorry. Can we just go again?

25:26.416 --> 25:28.500
You still look quite emotional and…

25:28.583 --> 25:30.750
No, no. Do I? I'm fine.

25:30.833 --> 25:33.583
Spectacularly unsustainable
in today's climate.

25:33.666 --> 25:35.208
Shut up, man.

25:36.083 --> 25:37.666
-Sorry?
-Just shut up.

25:37.750 --> 25:40.708
Steve, come on, buddy.
We knew this day was coming--

25:40.791 --> 25:43.500
Stop talking. Just stop talking.

25:43.583 --> 25:45.000
Stop talking!

25:45.083 --> 25:49.208
Or I'll climb over this table,
and I'll strangle you with my bare hands!

25:49.291 --> 25:52.916
-How would you like that, Julian?
-Death threats are a little much!

25:53.000 --> 25:54.166
Shut up!

25:54.250 --> 25:57.500
-Shut up! Shut up!
-Whoa! Steve! Steve!

25:58.083 --> 26:00.083
Shut up!

26:01.166 --> 26:02.500
Wow.

26:04.000 --> 26:07.041
-Oh, my God.
-God… Steve…

26:08.791 --> 26:09.916
Got ya.

26:13.750 --> 26:19.500
Th… Th… These are extraordinarily complex,
uh, young people, these lads.

26:20.083 --> 26:22.041
Extraordinarily complex.

26:22.125 --> 26:26.208
And as you know, we have
zero legal jurisdiction to keep them here.

26:26.291 --> 26:32.458
So, on top of every moral, and…
and logistical, and emotional, and…

26:32.541 --> 26:37.458
and… and educational catastrophe
you're about to visit on them,

26:37.541 --> 26:38.916
I think that if… if…

26:39.000 --> 26:42.250
if you say the school is closing
in the middle of the school term,

26:42.333 --> 26:43.250
then they're gone.

26:44.416 --> 26:46.750
We have to care for these kids.

26:46.833 --> 26:48.125
This is their home.

26:48.208 --> 26:52.208
This is a place that's in the process
of saving their lives.

26:52.291 --> 26:53.333
You know?

26:53.416 --> 27:00.375
There is busy, messy, wildly complex shit
going on here, there, and everywhere.

27:00.458 --> 27:02.000
Each day, every day.

27:02.083 --> 27:03.541
I mean, you…

27:03.625 --> 27:04.916
You cannot

27:05.666 --> 27:07.083
just stop.

27:07.166 --> 27:09.916
You can't press a button
and say, "No more."

27:10.000 --> 27:13.000
You know? I mean,
we need much, much more time.

27:17.125 --> 27:18.208
Okay.

27:19.791 --> 27:21.125
Charlotte, go on.

27:24.875 --> 27:26.291
It's…

27:26.791 --> 27:28.125
it's too late.

27:28.916 --> 27:31.708
It's happening. We've sold Stanton Wood.

27:35.666 --> 27:37.458
-God…
-I'm sorry.

27:37.541 --> 27:40.333
-Give me a second. I can't deal with it.
-Yeah.

27:49.833 --> 27:52.875
Why don't we start summarizing
your relationship with the boys?

27:52.958 --> 27:54.125
What do you think of them?

27:54.708 --> 27:56.375
Official answer.

27:58.000 --> 28:01.916
They are hugely complicated,
intricate human beings

28:02.000 --> 28:06.750
who require enormous amounts of what
we'd now call special educational care.

28:06.833 --> 28:11.458
It's exhausting, complicated,
demanding work, and it's destroying us.

28:11.541 --> 28:14.875
We are underpaid, we're understaffed,

28:14.958 --> 28:17.541
we're chronically under-resourced.

28:17.625 --> 28:21.625
I am part prison guard, I'm part nurse,

28:21.708 --> 28:25.333
I'm part battleaxe, I'm part mummy.

28:25.416 --> 28:27.916
I'm part… You know, you get me.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.041
-Yeah, I hear you.
-Um…

28:31.666 --> 28:33.625
-Unofficial answer?
-Go on.

28:35.458 --> 28:37.166
I fucking adore them.

28:51.041 --> 28:52.083
Fuck.

28:56.666 --> 29:00.208
What the fuck do you mean?
They were asking me…

29:20.541 --> 29:21.708
Hey, Steve.

29:25.708 --> 29:28.250
-I'm so, so angry right now.
-I know.

29:29.291 --> 29:30.416
I know.

29:31.916 --> 29:33.208
I've got ya.

29:33.291 --> 29:35.625
I'm so angry. I don't know what to do.

29:37.458 --> 29:38.958
Oh, God.

29:42.541 --> 29:46.416
Our beautiful,
fucking terrible boys, Steve.

29:46.500 --> 29:47.750
I know.

29:48.958 --> 29:51.458
-Our boys.
-I know. I know.

29:51.541 --> 29:52.958
I know…

29:53.750 --> 29:55.916
We'll carry them through this, and we'll…

29:56.000 --> 29:58.833
One by one, yeah? Like we always have.

30:00.166 --> 30:02.125
-Like we always have.
-Yeah.

30:04.500 --> 30:07.583
You know, they…
they won't let us anywhere near 'em.

30:07.666 --> 30:09.291
You know?

30:09.375 --> 30:15.125
Steve, in a minute… in a minute,
we're going to be out on our arses,

30:15.208 --> 30:17.625
unemployed fucking strangers, you know?

30:17.708 --> 30:19.625
-I know, but we're here now.
-And then…

30:19.708 --> 30:21.250
We've got 'til like Christmas…

30:21.333 --> 30:22.375
We're here now, Amanda.

30:22.458 --> 30:24.875
-We'll probably never see them again.
-Here you are.

30:25.583 --> 30:28.041
Give me a shout if you need help.

30:31.125 --> 30:35.083
So, uh, Shy and Benny, yeah?
The drum and bass nerve center, I'm told.

30:35.166 --> 30:36.541
Nah, listen, listen, innit?

30:36.625 --> 30:40.375
Atomic Bass Recordings, yeah, will be
bigger than anything you've ever seen.

30:40.458 --> 30:43.541
You see Shy? He's the CEO.
He'll run, like, the label side of stuff.

30:43.625 --> 30:45.500
See me?
I'm the day-to-day boss of the club.

30:45.583 --> 30:48.250
-Nightclub?
-Yeah, it's all in one huge building.

30:48.333 --> 30:52.125
Offices upstairs, shop and studio,
and then there's a club in the basement.

30:52.208 --> 30:54.666
Fucking polytunnels on the roof
growing the crops.

30:54.750 --> 30:56.625
-Yeah, of course.
-This is in London, yeah?

30:56.708 --> 30:58.791
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. 100%.
-Yeah, listen.

30:58.875 --> 31:01.458
Also, we have to build it
like a fortress, because, see, Shy,

31:01.541 --> 31:04.583
he's kind of a wanted man where he's from.
So, we have to protect the governor,

31:04.666 --> 31:06.166
the Shy One, the jungle bunny.

31:06.250 --> 31:08.416
Why is that? Sorry, do you mind me asking?

31:08.500 --> 31:11.125
Shy's a wanted man.
He cut a lad's face open with a bottle.

31:11.208 --> 31:12.708
-Shh!
-Nabeel, stop talking.

31:12.791 --> 31:14.875
Stop talking. This is not… not okay.

31:14.958 --> 31:16.125
-Steve.
-Stop filming.

31:16.208 --> 31:18.750
Please. Like, we-- we-- You said…

31:18.833 --> 31:21.541
Even if you blur out their faces,
legally, you can't have them talking…

31:21.625 --> 31:23.208
-He's here!
-It's not appropriate.

31:23.291 --> 31:24.750
-I understand.
-I thought we--

31:24.833 --> 31:27.166
-They're waiting for you in the hallway.
-Thanks. I'm coming.

31:27.250 --> 31:28.791
Guys, can you please stop filming?

31:28.875 --> 31:30.750
-Look, I… I can't…
-I'm not happy with this.

31:30.833 --> 31:31.833
None of that's staying in.

31:31.916 --> 31:33.875
-I'm not happy. It's not staying in.
-I understand.

31:33.958 --> 31:36.791
Steve, Steve, I'm… I'm so sorry.
Well, it's cool…

31:36.875 --> 31:38.666
I'm very sorry. It's not cool, actually.

31:38.750 --> 31:41.291
-You have our absolute assurance…
-Steve, he's waitin'!

31:41.375 --> 31:44.791
No, no. This guy is coming now.
He's only here because you guys are here.

31:44.875 --> 31:47.000
So, film him, and then we're done!

31:47.083 --> 31:48.291
Fuck's sake.

31:53.416 --> 31:56.750
-Hello there. Hi there. I'm… I'm Steven.
-Hello, hello, Steven.

31:56.833 --> 31:59.000
Hello, nice to meet you.
Come on this way.

31:59.083 --> 32:00.125
That's enough!

32:01.125 --> 32:03.458
-This is Amanda.
-Welcome to Stanton Wood.

32:03.541 --> 32:05.000
-Amanda.
-I'm Amanda, deputy head.

32:05.083 --> 32:05.958
Henry Harvey.

32:06.041 --> 32:08.875
Uh, this is Sarah.
She's part of our wonderful team.

32:08.958 --> 32:09.875
Sarah.

32:10.666 --> 32:11.833
Let's go this way.

32:12.541 --> 32:14.500
This is, um… quite something.

32:14.583 --> 32:20.125
So, uh, I suppose this is
a kind of a social area, recreation area.

32:20.208 --> 32:21.958
Look, he's there. He's coming.

32:22.041 --> 32:24.583
And… everyone's waiting! Here we are.

32:24.666 --> 32:28.375
Right, everybody, take a seat.
There should be enough seats.

32:28.458 --> 32:29.416
Great.

32:30.416 --> 32:34.541
Uh, so, everyone, this is Hugh Montague…

32:34.625 --> 32:37.333
-Sorry, I'm not sure the correct…
-Sir Hugh Montague--

32:37.416 --> 32:39.416
Powell. Montague-Powell.

32:40.125 --> 32:42.041
Spelled "Powell," pronounced "Pole."

32:42.125 --> 32:44.375
-Like Anthony.
-"Pole."

32:44.458 --> 32:46.208
Eh… But who cares, eh?

32:47.583 --> 32:50.666
-Well, welcome to Stanton Wood.
-Thank you.

32:52.166 --> 32:56.416
Well, Mr. "Pole",
Sir Benjamin Griffith here.

32:57.083 --> 32:59.583
Very good. Well met, Benjamin.

33:01.125 --> 33:06.500
Now, boys, you'll know this
because you're all bright, young chaps,

33:06.583 --> 33:10.375
but I'm your local
parliamentary representative,

33:10.458 --> 33:12.041
your MP.

33:12.125 --> 33:15.791
So, uh, I toil away
in Westminster making decisions

33:15.875 --> 33:18.958
about everything from foreign wars

33:19.041 --> 33:20.750
to the price of beans,

33:20.833 --> 33:23.083
to teachers' pay.

33:25.875 --> 33:29.291
And very soon, uh,
you'll be getting a vote,

33:30.208 --> 33:32.500
provided you stay out of prison,

33:32.583 --> 33:35.208
and you'll want
to use that vote very wisely.

33:35.291 --> 33:38.375
You'll want to think
about who will protect your money,

33:38.458 --> 33:41.833
your possessions, your freedoms.

33:41.916 --> 33:43.750
But we ain't got none of them.

33:43.833 --> 33:45.291
Sorry, say again?

33:45.375 --> 33:46.583
Don't matter.

33:47.333 --> 33:51.458
Uh, the lads have been doing,
uh, democracy.

33:52.958 --> 33:59.166
You know, just, uh,
discussing d… democracy, uh…

33:59.250 --> 34:02.125
unpacking it
in their Russia and Communism course.

34:02.208 --> 34:03.500
Well, there you have it.

34:03.583 --> 34:04.750
I've been working--

34:04.833 --> 34:08.125
When I'm not whizzing around
meeting people like you,

34:08.208 --> 34:12.791
I'm working hard to make sure
we don't go down that route.

34:12.875 --> 34:16.333
Communist Britain would not be
the green and pleasant land

34:16.416 --> 34:18.875
we currently all so enjoy.

34:18.958 --> 34:20.166
Brilliant.

34:21.208 --> 34:23.583
Okay, brilliant. That was great.

34:23.666 --> 34:26.083
Inspiring for the lads.
Um… Take a few photographs--

34:26.166 --> 34:29.750
Any questions about what goes on
up in the smoke?

34:33.416 --> 34:36.541
Come on, lads, you're not
usually backwards in coming forward.

34:37.166 --> 34:39.375
Princess Di gossip? State secrets?

34:39.458 --> 34:41.666
Come on, gents, ask away.

34:42.958 --> 34:44.041
Yes, young man?

34:45.416 --> 34:47.958
I wondered if, sir,

34:48.041 --> 34:51.500
is it a part of the training
for, like, becoming an MP,

34:51.583 --> 34:54.166
or have you always been a cunt?

34:56.583 --> 34:57.583
-What--
-Shy!

34:57.666 --> 34:59.416
He'll just fucking say anything.

34:59.500 --> 35:00.833
What the fuck?

35:00.916 --> 35:01.750
Sir.

35:01.833 --> 35:03.625
That's what I was wondering, though.

35:03.708 --> 35:05.250
You won't be using that.

35:05.333 --> 35:07.625
I wanted to-- to ask my question.

35:07.708 --> 35:10.416
We can ask questions though.
You said he could ask questions.

35:10.500 --> 35:12.166
-Can I ask you a question?
-"Pole"!

35:12.250 --> 35:13.583
You said that I could ask…

35:13.666 --> 35:15.250
Okay, everyone.

35:15.333 --> 35:16.166
"Pole"!

35:16.250 --> 35:18.541
Please answer the question, Mr. Powell.

35:31.041 --> 35:32.833
It's bullshit. It's fucking racist.

35:32.916 --> 35:36.416
That's interesting, Tarone.
Why do you think it's racist?

35:36.500 --> 35:38.083
I don't know. You tell me.

35:38.166 --> 35:41.500
Okay, if that's what you want to do, fine.

35:41.583 --> 35:43.916
Maybe that's a good idea, um…

35:45.083 --> 35:46.375
Perhaps you feel

35:46.458 --> 35:49.166
that if one of the other boys
had spoken to Shola

35:49.250 --> 35:52.166
in the way that you spoke to her,
said those things to her,

35:52.250 --> 35:54.708
they would be punished in a different way.

35:54.791 --> 35:55.708
You get me.

35:57.375 --> 36:01.208
'Cause I'm Black, and she's Black,
and they don't know what the fuck to do,

36:01.291 --> 36:03.375
and they think I'm some weirdo, a rapist…

36:03.458 --> 36:07.166
Okay, I'm going to stop you there.
I quite strongly disagree.

36:07.250 --> 36:11.333
Of course you do, Jenny.
'Cause you're all the exact fucking same.

36:11.416 --> 36:12.375
Careful, Tarone.

36:16.000 --> 36:18.125
I'll say how it looks from here. May I?

36:18.208 --> 36:19.416
Go on, tell me.

36:19.500 --> 36:22.958
One month special detention
and extra sessions with me

36:23.041 --> 36:27.541
for repeated instances
of sexual innuendo, abuse,

36:27.625 --> 36:33.125
and one instance of severely inappropriate
physical behavior towards Shola.

36:36.583 --> 36:39.708
You know, if you'd been hauled out of here
and the police had been called…

36:39.791 --> 36:40.708
Yeah.

36:40.791 --> 36:43.750
…I might wonder
if they were being even-handed.

36:43.833 --> 36:45.458
But look at Riley.

36:46.125 --> 36:47.916
Look at Jamie earlier this year.

36:48.000 --> 36:51.791
I think the punishments
are extremely even-handed.

36:51.875 --> 36:54.458
Thoughtful. Mild, even.

36:54.541 --> 36:56.250
In a normal school,

36:56.333 --> 37:00.875
if you'd said those things to Shola,
you would have been expelled, no question.

37:00.958 --> 37:03.333
And Shola could have pressed charges.

37:09.583 --> 37:11.375
Oh, Sarah, this looks lovely.

37:11.458 --> 37:13.083
-Thank you, Sarah.
-Looks lovely.

37:13.166 --> 37:15.083
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

37:15.166 --> 37:17.666
-Took mine as well.
-Come on, leave it now.

37:17.750 --> 37:19.791
You're not Alan Shearer.
You scored one goal.

37:19.875 --> 37:21.000
-It's mine.
-No.

37:21.083 --> 37:22.625
You didn't. What the fuck?

37:24.291 --> 37:26.708
He just stole that off you like a baby.

37:26.791 --> 37:28.166
Nah, bruv. I'll take it.

37:29.166 --> 37:31.291
-Don't start.
-Fuck, man!

37:33.708 --> 37:34.750
Yeah, listen.

37:34.833 --> 37:37.375
Well done for not getting rapey
with Shola again today.

37:37.458 --> 37:38.708
What?

37:38.791 --> 37:41.833
Yeah. Though she does look fit,
innit, doesn't she?

37:44.833 --> 37:45.916
Ooh…

37:46.791 --> 37:48.791
-Oh, my fuck!
-Shit, yeah?

37:48.875 --> 37:49.916
Pack it in!

37:50.000 --> 37:52.666
Fucking hell. Come on, what?
What, pussy? What?

37:52.750 --> 37:54.791
Get out of the kitchen!

37:54.875 --> 37:56.000
Give it to him!

37:56.083 --> 37:57.708
-Stop it!
-Fucking have it!

37:57.791 --> 37:59.416
How many times have I told you?

38:03.333 --> 38:04.583
Oh, fucking hell.

38:06.250 --> 38:09.625
Tell me. Why are you running, man?
Why are you running, Jamie? Huh?!

38:09.708 --> 38:11.125
Ooh!

38:11.208 --> 38:12.541
Fucking prick!

38:15.208 --> 38:16.250
Ah, fuck!

38:20.583 --> 38:21.416
Come on!

38:27.833 --> 38:30.375
-Move!
-Oi, smack him up!

38:30.958 --> 38:34.083
No! Stop!

38:40.000 --> 38:42.416
Everyone, just calm the fuck down!

38:50.625 --> 38:52.625
-Fucking little shit!
-Oh, shit!

38:53.125 --> 38:54.291
Fuck.

38:55.291 --> 38:57.791
Why do you have to be
such a prick all the time?

38:57.875 --> 38:58.833
What?

38:58.916 --> 39:00.875
Why do you have to be
a prick all the time?

39:00.958 --> 39:02.666
-I'll fucking murder you, Shy!
-No!

39:02.750 --> 39:04.833
-I'll fucking murder you!
-Enough! Enough!

39:04.916 --> 39:10.916
If 1996 Shy could say anything
to 1990 Shy, what would he say?

39:14.250 --> 39:16.250
Honestly, I just can't be arsed for it.

39:16.333 --> 39:17.791
Okay, let's stop.

39:17.875 --> 39:21.166
No, I want to do the thing.
I just meant with myself. I just hate it.

39:21.250 --> 39:24.208
My-- Myself, sometimes.

39:24.291 --> 39:27.166
Ah, well, okay. Let's stop then.

39:27.250 --> 39:28.791
I want to do it.

39:28.875 --> 39:29.916
Okay.

39:30.666 --> 39:33.500
I was so obsessed
with getting weed, and fags,

39:33.583 --> 39:36.375
and lemon Hooch, and…

39:37.666 --> 39:38.833
and rum.

39:41.041 --> 39:43.583
I wanted to get wasted all the time

39:43.666 --> 39:46.541
and be agg to my mum and stepdad.

39:48.125 --> 39:51.500
I hurt a kid really badly.

39:53.625 --> 39:55.875
And I stabbed my stepdad.

39:55.958 --> 39:56.916
Oh, shit.

39:57.000 --> 39:59.583
Only in the finger. He's fine.

39:59.666 --> 40:00.958
It actually…

40:01.041 --> 40:02.333
It ended up…

40:04.208 --> 40:07.625
It ended up being a bonding thing with us.

40:07.708 --> 40:09.666
And he's got chubby fingers, anyway.

40:09.750 --> 40:12.208
Yeah, he's a prick.

40:15.000 --> 40:17.708
Steve told us specifically not to do this.

40:17.791 --> 40:20.208
I think he meant
when there are boys in the room.

40:20.291 --> 40:23.000
-I'm not okay with this.
-It's fine, the rooms are empty.

40:23.083 --> 40:25.750
Come in here, Claire.
Get some of this artwork.

40:25.833 --> 40:27.916
-Claire, don't film this!
-It's okay.

40:28.000 --> 40:32.333
He doesn't like to talk about it,
but Steve was in a serious car accident

40:32.416 --> 40:33.833
about two…

40:33.916 --> 40:37.041
Actually, it's like,
more than three years ago now,

40:37.125 --> 40:38.291
and it was not good.

40:38.375 --> 40:42.250
I mean, literally, you know, cutting him
out of the car on a roundabout.

40:42.333 --> 40:44.083
Oh.

40:44.166 --> 40:46.291
-Right, shall we go now?
-Oh, my God.

40:46.375 --> 40:47.916
Um…

40:48.000 --> 40:49.125
God.

40:50.375 --> 40:52.416
-"Shy."
-Shy.

40:53.500 --> 40:55.708
-Just looks like a nice kid.
-Yeah.

40:55.791 --> 40:57.750
-Geoff, can you clear the frame?
-I'm--

40:57.833 --> 40:59.833
I'm not sure about going
through the drawers.

40:59.916 --> 41:02.500
-Maybe just what's on the shelf.
-It's breaking.

41:02.583 --> 41:05.791
-Fucking hell! What's in here?
-"Atomic Bass Recordings."

41:05.875 --> 41:07.458
Have you seen how heavy this is?

41:09.291 --> 41:10.875
Go on, have a look.

41:13.791 --> 41:15.166
Um…

41:16.208 --> 41:19.000
Literally a bag of rocks.

41:48.458 --> 41:50.041
Thank you.

41:50.583 --> 41:53.791
Please respect me enough
to listen to what I have to say.

41:58.666 --> 42:00.500
You know, actually, I'm thinking,

42:00.583 --> 42:04.333
if we're looking for a reason
you're not getting REM sleep,

42:05.541 --> 42:08.250
we need look no further
than this music, right?

42:09.416 --> 42:12.166
It's very fast and choppy and metallic.

42:12.250 --> 42:14.375
It's very "on".

42:14.958 --> 42:16.125
Isn't it, Shy?

42:26.000 --> 42:28.500
We've been making
such good progress recently.

42:32.916 --> 42:34.708
Oh, dear. Okay.

42:39.250 --> 42:41.125
Has something happened
with your mum and Iain?

42:41.208 --> 42:44.375
Has there been some kind of trouble
I've not been made aware of?

42:46.666 --> 42:49.375
Everything all right with Benny?
Plans for the label?

42:55.500 --> 42:57.500
You still enjoying science?

42:58.958 --> 43:00.125
Geology?

43:01.708 --> 43:05.041
Why don't we get out one of your charts?

43:13.375 --> 43:17.291
Stop pretending you know me!

43:18.083 --> 43:21.000
You don't know me!

43:22.083 --> 43:24.083
You only know what I tell you!

43:24.166 --> 43:25.000
Okay, Shy.

44:00.291 --> 44:03.041
-Cal, you're finished, by the way.
-Smashed through it.

44:03.125 --> 44:04.625
Punch the gay boy already!

44:04.708 --> 44:05.875
-Like, boom!
-Ow!

44:06.875 --> 44:08.750
Stop being a girl. Go on, Cal.

44:08.833 --> 44:10.416
Get him back.

44:10.500 --> 44:13.333
Shy. Shy, can I…

44:13.416 --> 44:14.250
Huh?

44:14.333 --> 44:17.583
-Can I take you for two minutes?
-I know what you're gonna say, though.

44:17.666 --> 44:20.125
Come on, just out in the corridor.
Two seconds.

44:23.250 --> 44:27.000
Said I'm such a girl, bro.
I'm fucking missing that shit.

44:33.333 --> 44:34.916
Um…

44:35.000 --> 44:36.833
So…

44:37.750 --> 44:39.708
I heard about what happened with Jenny.

44:42.666 --> 44:45.041
Good news is,
the chair isn't pressing charges.

44:47.625 --> 44:49.291
So funny, man.

44:50.708 --> 44:51.625
Shy…

44:52.541 --> 44:54.166
Okay, that was a bad gag.

44:54.250 --> 44:56.458
Right? It was a-- It was naff.

45:00.833 --> 45:04.208
Listen, I think we've always
been honest with each other.

45:04.291 --> 45:06.708
I can tell there's something up with you,

45:06.791 --> 45:11.666
and all I want for you to do
is to just use us.

45:11.750 --> 45:14.416
You know, use the people here
that care for you.

45:15.125 --> 45:16.125
Speak to us.

45:16.208 --> 45:20.000
Just me, or Amanda,
or even the lads. Whoever.

45:20.708 --> 45:24.583
'Cause you're not alone, Shy.
That's the whole point.

45:28.500 --> 45:29.500
Come on.

45:32.250 --> 45:34.958
Or call your mum,
and then she can come with Iain,

45:35.041 --> 45:36.541
and we can all have a discussion.

45:36.625 --> 45:37.916
-Oh, my God.
-Talk it out.

45:38.000 --> 45:40.916
Just actually fuck off, Steve!

45:41.000 --> 45:44.250
Dude, I don't want to talk.
I am sick of talking.

45:44.333 --> 45:46.083
I am sick of Jenny.

45:46.166 --> 45:47.750
And I'm sick of you.

45:47.833 --> 45:49.333
Yeah, I get that. I get that.

45:49.416 --> 45:51.125
-I understand.
-What about you, Steve?

45:52.333 --> 45:54.000
Let's talk about you.

45:55.708 --> 45:57.666
Why do you fucking give a shit?

45:59.125 --> 46:00.125
You weirdo.

46:00.208 --> 46:01.791
-Shy.
-What are you anyway?

46:01.875 --> 46:04.083
Are you a fucking alky or something?

46:12.666 --> 46:14.791
So, what we're doing
is we're asking everyone

46:14.875 --> 46:17.000
to describe themselves in three words.

46:17.083 --> 46:18.125
Oh, okay.

46:19.500 --> 46:20.666
Um…

46:22.708 --> 46:24.791
Very, very tired.

46:28.583 --> 46:32.291
And, um, what about the boys?

46:33.041 --> 46:34.750
What do they think of you?

46:34.833 --> 46:38.208
Cal, fucking do something!
Punch him in the fucking fanny!

46:39.250 --> 46:42.083
All right, gents. Sit down.
Boys, sit down, please.

46:42.166 --> 46:43.083
Um--

46:43.166 --> 46:46.875
Okay, so today has slipped
out of shape for various reasons…

46:46.958 --> 46:48.583
I think they think I'm all right.

46:48.666 --> 46:50.625
Ash, are you good? Riley?

46:50.708 --> 46:54.083
I mean, I'm a dickhead, and a wanker,
and a tosser, and a knobhead, and…

46:54.166 --> 46:58.166
I could get 'em all arrested
for verbal abuse.

46:58.250 --> 47:00.333
And anti-Irish bigotry.

47:00.416 --> 47:04.833
But I think that they maybe…
I hope that they trust me.

47:04.916 --> 47:07.208
Remember I was talking
about the age of the planet?

47:07.291 --> 47:10.291
So, this line that I drew here, lads,
okay, so this,

47:10.375 --> 47:13.666
all the way is like the age of the planet,
all the way round, round, round.

47:13.750 --> 47:19.666
Right, all the way, all the way.
Way, way, way, way, way into town, yeah?

47:19.750 --> 47:22.875
You know, you get involved
in some explosive situations

47:22.958 --> 47:25.291
because the kids are angry
with each other,

47:25.375 --> 47:27.125
or they're angry with authority, or…

47:27.208 --> 47:28.166
Over here…

47:28.250 --> 47:29.291
…their mum and dad.

47:29.375 --> 47:31.958
-This is humanity. Do you get it?
-Holy shit.

47:32.041 --> 47:33.541
So, that's what I'm trying to…

47:33.625 --> 47:35.958
People have bailed on them
for various reasons.

47:36.041 --> 47:39.250
So, all my staff are here
because they want to be here.

47:39.333 --> 47:41.416
You know? That's what I'm trying to…

47:42.000 --> 47:44.166
And I think that that means something.

47:44.250 --> 47:46.500
-How old do we think these rocks are?
-Uh, wank.

47:47.666 --> 47:51.375
No, chalk, Jamie, chalk.
Just re-- re-- regular old chalk.

47:51.458 --> 47:52.541
-Anyone?
-Fifty mil!

47:52.625 --> 47:53.833
-No.
-Yeah, Benny. Yeah.

47:53.916 --> 47:55.125
-What?
-And, um…

47:56.833 --> 47:58.125
Um…

47:58.208 --> 48:01.625
Can anyone…
Does anyone know what chalk is made of?

48:02.666 --> 48:04.416
-Anyone?
-You're fucking stupid.

48:04.500 --> 48:06.000
-Shut up, man.
-Shut up.

48:06.083 --> 48:08.625
Billions of little crushed up, like…

48:08.708 --> 48:11.833
-What, Shy?
-Billions of little crushed up…

48:11.916 --> 48:14.375
-Yes, that's it.
-No, I don't know.

48:14.458 --> 48:15.416
No, you got it.

48:15.500 --> 48:16.833
No, I don't know.

48:16.916 --> 48:17.958
You got it.

48:23.625 --> 48:27.416
So, it's like millions and billions
of crushed up little fossils, basically.

48:27.500 --> 48:30.250
Like, uh, like little seashells…

48:30.333 --> 48:32.916
If your teachers
could describe you in three words,

48:33.000 --> 48:34.708
what do you think they'd say?

48:35.875 --> 48:39.083
That's what I'm saying. One day
to the next would be mad different.

48:39.166 --> 48:45.208
Like, some days,
they'd say chatty, clever, chilled.

48:45.291 --> 48:48.500
And then, the next day, say…

48:50.083 --> 48:54.333
miserable and disruptive, pissy.

48:55.375 --> 48:58.166
You seem like someone
very emotionally intelligent,

48:58.250 --> 48:59.791
if you don't mind me saying.

49:00.541 --> 49:05.000
I know. It's like looking at the night sky
and trying to hold it all in your head.

49:05.083 --> 49:08.000
-All right, don't cry, Steve.
-What?

49:08.083 --> 49:10.833
You've seen it.
I mean, it's chaotic, right?

49:11.791 --> 49:13.708
But we… we think it's working.

49:13.791 --> 49:16.041
You can lock these kids up
and throw away the key,

49:17.125 --> 49:19.166
but we feel we're doing something.

49:19.250 --> 49:20.750
There's an alternative.

49:26.958 --> 49:29.750
-Fuck off!
-Prick! Come here, you dickhead.

49:51.166 --> 49:52.666
Fire!

49:52.750 --> 49:55.416
Steve! Steve!

49:55.500 --> 49:56.500
Fire!

50:19.041 --> 50:20.458
Steve, who pulled it?

50:21.541 --> 50:22.708
It was pulled.

50:46.166 --> 50:49.541
Uh, can you describe
your colleagues in three words?

50:51.250 --> 50:54.041
Love it. Um… Off the record?

50:54.125 --> 50:57.916
Yeah, yeah, totally.
It's just for fun and therapy.

50:58.000 --> 50:59.000
Okay.

50:59.625 --> 51:01.541
Steve…

51:02.458 --> 51:04.833
Steve is…

51:06.541 --> 51:07.875
proper.

51:15.125 --> 51:17.250
He's one of the good guys, you know?

51:19.250 --> 51:20.708
He's authentic.

51:24.875 --> 51:26.875
Yeah. He's the boss.

51:42.291 --> 51:43.250
I get it.

51:44.541 --> 51:45.416
Okay?

51:46.875 --> 51:48.916
I hate class, yeah?

51:49.000 --> 51:50.791
I've been mad stressed out.

51:50.875 --> 51:54.208
Missing out on pool table privileges
basically ruined my fucking life!

51:54.291 --> 51:55.625
I miss drugs. I miss pussy.

51:55.708 --> 51:58.041
-I wish I was out of fucking school!
-Okay, thank you.

52:02.583 --> 52:03.416
Oi.

52:04.875 --> 52:08.125
You know,
you might actually like this, Jenny.

52:10.041 --> 52:12.125
I was chatting to Jungle Bunny.

52:12.208 --> 52:14.208
-Shy.
-Yeah.

52:16.791 --> 52:21.000
And he was saying how our mums
always used to be up in our shit.

52:21.916 --> 52:22.875
You know?

52:24.000 --> 52:25.333
Hassling us.

52:26.500 --> 52:29.000
"Stop this. Stop that."

52:29.541 --> 52:31.458
"Don't do this. Don't do that."

52:32.541 --> 52:34.208
"You've ruined this family."

52:41.000 --> 52:44.083
And he said to me, "Bro, I miss that."

52:48.875 --> 52:50.375
I told him, "Look, I'm…"

52:52.666 --> 52:55.875
"I miss that too, innit. I miss her."

53:00.875 --> 53:03.416
Ah, my mum.

53:09.125 --> 53:10.666
I ruined her life, innit?

53:13.750 --> 53:16.500
But there it is, Jenny.

53:17.166 --> 53:18.250
There you go.

53:20.708 --> 53:23.458
Jenny. Jenny penny menny.

53:23.541 --> 53:27.083
Take that, put it in your pipe,
and fucking smoke it.

53:31.250 --> 53:35.291
It's pretty much exactly
what I said to Tarone this afternoon.

53:35.375 --> 53:36.833
In a normal school…

53:36.916 --> 53:38.791
He'd be arrested, sorry to be blunt.

53:38.875 --> 53:41.541
Well, quite.
It's what I've been trying to say to you.

53:43.083 --> 53:44.875
But from Shola's point of view, we've--

53:44.958 --> 53:46.958
When I say "we," I mean you,

53:47.041 --> 53:51.291
the school, have been remiss
to the point of negligence in not…

53:51.375 --> 53:53.125
Sorry. Sorry, Jenny.

53:53.666 --> 53:56.375
Is the bloody film crew hiding in here?

53:56.458 --> 53:57.916
I think they're done.

53:58.000 --> 54:00.625
-God, they've been everywhere.
-Hope so.

54:00.708 --> 54:03.166
Hello, Steve.
Quite the day you've all been having.

54:03.250 --> 54:04.375
Yes. Yeah.

54:04.458 --> 54:07.541
Shy narrowly escaped getting carted off
to the Tower of London

54:07.625 --> 54:09.958
for verbally assaulting a lord, or a sir.

54:10.041 --> 54:11.708
Is he a sir? He's a sir.

54:11.791 --> 54:14.041
-Ugh. Yeah, Amanda was telling me.
-Fucking hell.

54:14.125 --> 54:17.250
I've never disliked a person
as much in my entire life.

54:17.333 --> 54:19.000
And the timing, you know.

54:19.083 --> 54:22.666
Poor old Shy. He's up, he's down,
and then bam, he's a comedy genius.

54:22.750 --> 54:24.666
Yeah, I really want to discuss that.

54:25.666 --> 54:27.625
Or, Steve, do you want to, um…

54:28.916 --> 54:30.041
No, you go. You go.

54:31.875 --> 54:34.916
All right. Um, well, I had…

54:35.791 --> 54:39.708
I had a disastrous session with him
this afternoon. A…

54:39.791 --> 54:44.541
He attacked a chair, but I think
I need to go back further than that

54:44.625 --> 54:48.333
to last Thursday,
or even the Thursday before.

54:48.416 --> 54:53.458
I have noticed a distinct change
in his receptiveness

54:53.541 --> 54:56.750
to the things that we do here
week in, week out.

54:56.833 --> 54:59.958
He's completely stopped his diary.

55:00.041 --> 55:03.666
He's completely stopped
his morning sentences, his breathing.

55:03.750 --> 55:06.125
He says it's all pointless.

55:06.208 --> 55:09.833
And he's previously been so eloquent
about his night terrors

55:09.916 --> 55:11.083
and his…

55:12.083 --> 55:13.583
his barbed wire feeling.

55:13.666 --> 55:15.083
And just in the last month--

55:15.166 --> 55:18.083
Yeah, it feels
like he's backed out of the room.

55:18.166 --> 55:19.833
Yeah, Steve, he has.

55:19.916 --> 55:21.458
-And I'm worried.
-Yeah.

55:21.541 --> 55:24.166
I mean, I think things
are okay within the group.

55:24.250 --> 55:27.250
-You know, the drum and bass crew. Yeah?
-Yeah, they seem to be.

55:27.333 --> 55:28.833
Oh, no.

55:28.916 --> 55:31.125
It's pissing down, look at that. Oh!

55:31.208 --> 55:34.750
Yeah, he's…
He takes things to heart, but he's…

55:34.833 --> 55:37.583
I mean, him and Benny are fine,
him and Cal are fine.

55:37.666 --> 55:40.500
You know, I mean, he's been quiet.

55:40.583 --> 55:42.500
Yeah, um… he, um…

55:43.375 --> 55:44.416
He, um…

55:44.500 --> 55:47.875
I asked if his folks would want
to come up for the weekend,

55:47.958 --> 55:49.750
and he reacted very badly to that.

55:49.833 --> 55:53.250
But he's been very, very quiet, mostly.
Up until Cuntgate.

55:53.333 --> 55:54.500
Ooh.

55:54.583 --> 55:57.708
You know, I know you adopt
an out-of-sight policy here.

55:57.791 --> 55:59.083
I'm talking about marijuana.

55:59.166 --> 56:01.625
Bloody hell,
I wouldn't go that far. We do our best.

56:01.708 --> 56:04.708
-Most boys are social users.
-We've got to pick our battles.

56:04.791 --> 56:07.125
But I think Shy would rather smoke alone.

56:07.208 --> 56:10.041
We can confirm on the weed.
Me and Owen can do better.

56:10.125 --> 56:14.958
We're on it, um… But it's always been
a tricky aspect of this site.

56:18.250 --> 56:20.958
Yeah, he has a genuine desire.

56:21.041 --> 56:23.625
You know,
and I really fucking feel for him.

56:23.708 --> 56:26.875
He has a genuine desire
to clamber out of himself.

56:26.958 --> 56:29.041
Owen, a fucking handball!

56:29.625 --> 56:30.583
Look, I'm…

56:32.083 --> 56:35.208
I promise I'm not criticizing
anybody personally here, but…

56:36.166 --> 56:38.875
I've never felt like this
at Stanton Wood before.

56:40.458 --> 56:44.750
I asked to speak to you
about Shy two weeks ago,

56:44.833 --> 56:47.666
and I asked you again twice this week.

56:52.041 --> 56:55.250
That is your basic, basic duty of care.

56:55.333 --> 56:57.000
Jenny, it's been a bit mental.

56:57.083 --> 57:01.000
You know that I adore coming here,
and I respect what you all do so much,

57:01.083 --> 57:03.041
but Steve, you can't do it all.

57:03.125 --> 57:05.291
And with someone like Shy…

57:05.375 --> 57:08.250
Why don't you just
magic up some more staff, Jenny?

57:08.333 --> 57:11.291
Look,
I'm not casting aspersions, but Steve…

57:14.375 --> 57:16.000
perhaps there's a limit to what you--

57:16.083 --> 57:18.250
I'll stop you there
before you offend anyone.

57:20.083 --> 57:21.708
It's over anyway.

57:22.291 --> 57:24.916
What do you mean, "It's over," Amanda?

57:25.000 --> 57:26.875
They're closing the school.

57:41.583 --> 57:43.916
I want to be here, like, at Stanton Wood,

57:44.000 --> 57:46.166
but sometimes I just want
to be four years old, and…

57:48.250 --> 57:50.041
start again and not fuck it up.

57:51.541 --> 57:53.875
Have another run at it,
but not in my head.

57:55.333 --> 57:56.833
Not fuck so much stuff up,

57:56.916 --> 57:59.708
not feel like all the things I fuck up
are on me.

58:00.750 --> 58:02.625
Like, stuck to me.

58:09.583 --> 58:10.750
What about you, Steve?

58:10.833 --> 58:13.416
Let's talk about you.
Why do you fucking give a shit?

58:13.500 --> 58:15.125
-Shy.
-What are you anyway?

58:15.208 --> 58:17.458
Are you a fucking alky or something?

58:19.958 --> 58:22.583
It's over. No more phone calls or visits.

58:23.291 --> 58:25.666
You can't pause contact with me.
I'm your son.

58:25.750 --> 58:27.500
Shut up and listen.

58:41.166 --> 58:42.958
This is your fault, Steve.

58:44.041 --> 58:45.333
This is your fault.

59:10.583 --> 59:14.625
I've gotta get on with stuff.
I'll see you soon, Jenny, all right?

59:38.000 --> 59:39.041
Steve.

59:46.000 --> 59:47.083
I'm sorry.

01:00:01.791 --> 01:00:03.000
It's okay.

01:00:07.750 --> 01:00:09.166
-You okay?
-Yeah.

01:00:10.208 --> 01:00:12.291
Yeah, it's good. It's good.

01:00:14.375 --> 01:00:15.666
-Bye.
-Okay.

01:01:04.291 --> 01:01:06.458
Fuck off!

01:01:06.541 --> 01:01:08.000
Fuck off!

01:01:11.083 --> 01:01:14.041
You're all good? You're okay, Shola?

01:01:14.125 --> 01:01:16.958
Yeah. Yeah, I'm all good.

01:01:17.041 --> 01:01:20.833
Okay. Um, Amanda,
can you undersign this, please?

01:01:20.916 --> 01:01:23.500
Okay. Yep.

01:01:27.666 --> 01:01:30.250
There wasn't any shit during the football?

01:01:30.333 --> 01:01:31.208
No.

01:01:32.416 --> 01:01:35.166
Yeah, I think I kinda schooled them,
to be honest.

01:01:36.083 --> 01:01:37.416
Unless I'm being naive,

01:01:37.500 --> 01:01:41.625
but everyone was pretty well-behaved,
and Tarone hasn't uttered a word to me.

01:01:41.708 --> 01:01:45.291
All right, I'm gonna go
and do the rounds and smoke a roll-up.

01:01:45.375 --> 01:01:46.500
Right. Yep.

01:01:47.708 --> 01:01:49.791
Yeah.

01:01:49.875 --> 01:01:51.750
As a great poet said,

01:01:51.833 --> 01:01:55.416
"We must smoke
while we still have mouths to puff with."

01:01:56.333 --> 01:01:57.541
Oh, Shola. Shola?

01:01:57.625 --> 01:02:00.708
Can you just hang on for a minute?
Maybe we can have that chat?

01:02:01.958 --> 01:02:02.916
Right now?

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:04.666
If that's okay, yeah.

01:02:06.541 --> 01:02:07.375
'Course.

01:02:07.458 --> 01:02:09.666
Yeah, come into my office.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:17.708
What a fucking day.

01:02:19.166 --> 01:02:24.083
Yeah, well,
up until that whole chicken Kiev war zone,

01:02:24.166 --> 01:02:27.500
it was all going so well.
It was a pretty chill day, I think.

01:02:30.916 --> 01:02:33.750
Um, right, so… first things first.

01:02:33.833 --> 01:02:38.625
Yeah. So, these… uh, stupid tapes,
I know they're really silly,

01:02:38.708 --> 01:02:42.541
but we didn't have time for a briefing,
so that's why I'm doing them.

01:02:44.083 --> 01:02:45.666
They're… They're great, Steve.

01:02:45.750 --> 01:02:47.291
-Really?
-Yeah.

01:02:47.375 --> 01:02:51.375
Shola says she actually likes
the tapes, Steve.

01:02:53.458 --> 01:02:56.666
Shola says
she actually likes the tapes, Steve.

01:02:58.166 --> 01:03:02.083
Good, and the rota-- the rota--
Is your-- is your rota better?

01:03:02.166 --> 01:03:05.916
Yeah. I'm loving the new days,
so thank you.

01:03:09.875 --> 01:03:11.208
I know…

01:03:13.375 --> 01:03:16.250
I know Amanda doesn't think I'm…

01:03:17.458 --> 01:03:19.791
up for this, or ready, or--

01:03:19.875 --> 01:03:21.416
What do you mean, "up for it"?

01:03:22.791 --> 01:03:26.291
Uh, this, the teaching, this place.

01:03:26.375 --> 01:03:29.125
No, that's not it. That's not it.

01:03:30.375 --> 01:03:32.541
I mean, she literally said that.

01:03:32.625 --> 01:03:33.916
No, Amanda…

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:37.083
Amanda, she'll say shit
if she's stressed, you know.

01:03:37.166 --> 01:03:39.250
Like, none of us are fucking…

01:03:39.333 --> 01:03:43.083
None of us are, like, paid enough
or trained enough or good enough.

01:03:43.166 --> 01:03:45.625
None of us are. So, don't…

01:03:45.708 --> 01:03:48.125
That's not enough--
That's, like, not reason to…

01:03:50.291 --> 01:03:52.333
-You can't just jack it in.
-Mm.

01:03:52.416 --> 01:03:53.750
It's all fucked.

01:03:58.875 --> 01:04:00.375
Yeah, it's just, I'm…

01:04:01.291 --> 01:04:04.333
I really want to be here, Steve. I'm…

01:04:04.875 --> 01:04:07.291
I'm really good at this.

01:04:07.375 --> 01:04:08.708
You really are, Shola.

01:04:08.791 --> 01:04:12.625
Just the whole Tarone situation,
it was just bad timing.

01:04:12.708 --> 01:04:16.166
And I feel like if I was here
maybe a year ago,

01:04:16.250 --> 01:04:17.750
I'd have handled it differently.

01:04:17.833 --> 01:04:19.291
And look, if I…

01:04:19.375 --> 01:04:22.166
I feel like I wasn't on that quick enough.

01:04:22.250 --> 01:04:26.708
And I-- And if you felt unsupported
or… alone at any point,

01:04:26.791 --> 01:04:29.833
I truly, truly am sorry.

01:04:31.083 --> 01:04:33.875
Damn it, Steve, gonna make me cry.

01:04:36.458 --> 01:04:40.250
It's all good.
It's a massive learning curve.

01:04:40.333 --> 01:04:44.041
Well, we're really lucky
to have you. I mean that.

01:04:44.125 --> 01:04:44.958
Thank you.

01:04:48.708 --> 01:04:50.333
Uh…

01:04:50.416 --> 01:04:53.750
Something else I'd like to ask,
if that's okay.

01:04:53.833 --> 01:04:55.916
Oh, maybe you don't know or…

01:04:57.625 --> 01:04:59.166
What the fuck?

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.125
December?

01:05:01.208 --> 01:05:02.083
Yeah.

01:05:02.166 --> 01:05:05.166
Like, what does…
what does that mean exactly?

01:05:05.250 --> 01:05:09.791
-Do we have to start looking for jobs or…?
-I don't know. I don't know, Shola.

01:05:14.083 --> 01:05:15.125
I don't…

01:05:17.833 --> 01:05:19.250
I dunno, I dunno.

01:05:26.916 --> 01:05:28.208
Um…

01:05:29.458 --> 01:05:32.000
Well, at least…

01:05:33.708 --> 01:05:35.458
At least we met an MP.

01:05:36.583 --> 01:05:38.791
-A real-life MP.
-Yeah.

01:05:38.875 --> 01:05:42.208
That was, um, a true honor.

01:05:42.291 --> 01:05:43.833
A real-life MP.

01:05:51.291 --> 01:05:54.416
W-- Was there anything else you…

01:05:55.458 --> 01:05:57.583
-No.
-No, okay. Um…

01:05:58.375 --> 01:05:59.833
-Cool. Well…
-Cool.

01:05:59.916 --> 01:06:02.000
I'm off. I'll see you bright and early?

01:06:02.083 --> 01:06:03.166
Yeah. See you.

01:06:03.250 --> 01:06:04.166
You overnight?

01:06:04.250 --> 01:06:06.541
Yeah, me and Amanda and Owen. Yeah.

01:06:06.625 --> 01:06:09.500
-Cool. Okay, get some rest. I'll see you.
-All good, yep.

01:06:17.583 --> 01:06:22.000
Okay. Um, call, um, Shy's mum and stepdad,

01:06:22.083 --> 01:06:25.708
and, uh… note to file, full disclosure

01:06:25.791 --> 01:06:29.625
on his behavior… …and our concerns.

01:06:29.708 --> 01:06:30.750
Um…

01:06:31.375 --> 01:06:36.291
A full written report from Jenny
and full mea culpa from me, um…

01:06:37.375 --> 01:06:39.916
Reset on the meds with the GP.

01:06:40.708 --> 01:06:45.500
T-t-try and sort out
the fucking rooms with, uh…

01:06:45.583 --> 01:06:48.000
And just fucking deal with it, Steven.

01:06:51.166 --> 01:06:53.208
You're fucking, fucking heading

01:06:53.291 --> 01:06:56.250
on this fucking stupid,
fucking roundabout of doom.

01:06:56.833 --> 01:06:57.666
You f…

01:07:00.041 --> 01:07:02.125
They're closing your school, Steven.

01:07:04.333 --> 01:07:06.125
…Steven.

01:07:07.250 --> 01:07:10.708
…fucking heading on this fucking stupid,
fucking roundabout of doom.

01:07:12.208 --> 01:07:14.333
They're closing your school, Steven.

01:07:16.791 --> 01:07:18.458
They're closing your school, Steven.

01:07:20.375 --> 01:07:21.291
…Steven.

01:08:11.083 --> 01:08:12.458
You working hard?

01:08:12.541 --> 01:08:14.416
Ha.

01:08:16.583 --> 01:08:18.625
-You-- You're drinking?
-Yep.

01:08:18.708 --> 01:08:20.375
-You're drinking?
-Yep.

01:08:20.458 --> 01:08:22.250
Just having a glass of wine.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.583
It's not a big deal. Having a--
There's loads over there.

01:08:25.666 --> 01:08:28.416
It's the Christmas red.
You should have a glass, Amanda.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:36.750
-Have you taken something?
-No!

01:08:36.833 --> 01:08:40.041
-Ha!
-No, Amanda. Come on. Just leave me…

01:08:41.041 --> 01:08:43.583
Like, I'm just having a glass of wine.

01:08:44.375 --> 01:08:47.416
Really. I'm just having a glass of wine.
You should have a glass.

01:08:54.916 --> 01:08:57.083
You know, none of this is your fault.

01:09:01.291 --> 01:09:02.875
-Mm.
-Steve.

01:09:05.583 --> 01:09:06.666
Yeah, but it is.

01:09:06.750 --> 01:09:07.916
No, it's not.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:09.958
-But it is.
-No, it's not!

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:15.666
Steven, it's not your fault.

01:09:16.333 --> 01:09:19.416
The school closing, not your fault.

01:09:23.708 --> 01:09:25.083
The car crash.

01:09:26.666 --> 01:09:29.000
-The little girl dying.
-Oh, please, please, please.

01:09:29.083 --> 01:09:30.791
-No. I mean, look, I'm…
-Please.

01:09:30.875 --> 01:09:34.000
-Why don't you talk about it?
-No, no, Amanda, I'm not doing this now.

01:09:34.083 --> 01:09:36.916
-Somebody died, and if you're numbing…
-I'm not doing this now.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:38.916
-Here's to you too. Come on.
-No, no.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:40.708
-Take your gla--
-No, no.

01:09:40.791 --> 01:09:42.500
I want you to talk about it.

01:09:42.583 --> 01:09:46.083
I want you to say it's not your fault.
I want you to acknowledge it.

01:09:46.166 --> 01:09:49.250
I want you to look at me
and acknowledge it!

01:09:51.791 --> 01:09:55.291
'Cause you're in agony, mate.
You're in fucking agony!

01:09:55.375 --> 01:09:57.875
You really are, and you can't numb it,

01:09:57.958 --> 01:09:59.375
and you can't stop it

01:09:59.458 --> 01:10:02.583
'cause you don't fucking deal
with it, Steve!

01:10:02.666 --> 01:10:05.416
You don't fucking deal with it!

01:10:11.166 --> 01:10:14.916
Me and Steve, you know, we expected
something quite different here.

01:10:15.875 --> 01:10:18.375
Two full year groups,
you know, 60-odd kids,

01:10:18.458 --> 01:10:19.916
and almost as many teachers.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:23.708
And it was supposed to be
this center of excellence.

01:10:24.583 --> 01:10:27.875
And cut after cut,
and we are down to the bare bones,

01:10:27.958 --> 01:10:30.041
and we're just limping along

01:10:30.125 --> 01:10:33.583
in a sort of permanent crisis mode.

01:10:33.666 --> 01:10:34.583
And…

01:10:36.250 --> 01:10:39.666
Steve feels bad about it,
and he shouldn't, you know?

01:10:39.750 --> 01:10:40.708
Um…

01:10:40.791 --> 01:10:43.583
And I get it 'cause I feel bad about it,
and I shouldn't,

01:10:43.666 --> 01:10:46.541
but I think that's why we work,
because both of us, you know,

01:10:46.625 --> 01:10:50.000
we're really locked into this place
for better or worse,

01:10:50.083 --> 01:10:52.166
and it's almost always worse.

01:11:05.333 --> 01:11:11.458
I see

01:11:12.041 --> 01:11:17.958
Unseen

01:11:18.041 --> 01:11:24.166
I feel

01:11:24.833 --> 01:11:30.875
Unseen

01:14:43.166 --> 01:14:44.583
Fucking…

01:15:44.500 --> 01:15:47.625
Just actually fuck off, Steve.

01:15:48.708 --> 01:15:52.250
Dude, I don't want to talk.
I am sick of talking.

01:15:54.916 --> 01:15:56.541
I'm sick of Jenny.

01:16:00.333 --> 01:16:02.291
What about you, Steve?

01:16:04.583 --> 01:16:06.708
Why do you fucking give a shit?

01:16:41.166 --> 01:16:42.708
Oh, no, no.

01:16:45.083 --> 01:16:45.958
No, no.

01:16:46.875 --> 01:16:47.916
Oh, no!

01:16:48.541 --> 01:16:49.750
No, no, no.

01:16:50.375 --> 01:16:52.750
-Amanda. Amanda!
-What?

01:16:52.833 --> 01:16:54.125
-Amanda, Shy's gone.
-What's that?

01:16:54.208 --> 01:16:55.208
-Shy's gone.
-What?

01:16:55.291 --> 01:16:56.416
Shy's gone. He left a note.

01:16:56.500 --> 01:16:58.000
-What?
-Don't wake up the boys.

01:16:58.083 --> 01:17:00.291
-He's not there, he's gone!
-What are we gonna--

01:17:00.375 --> 01:17:02.916
-Come on, we gotta go find him. But he's--
-It's okay.

01:17:03.458 --> 01:17:06.708
What the fuck have you done?
You've taken something, haven't you?

01:17:06.791 --> 01:17:09.416
-What have you taken?
-I just had a few glasses of wine.

01:17:09.500 --> 01:17:12.750
You lied to me.
You lied to me, you weak, stupid…

01:17:12.833 --> 01:17:15.250
Fucking lied to me. You fucking find him.

01:17:15.333 --> 01:17:16.166
You fucking lied.

01:17:20.291 --> 01:17:21.625
Shy!

01:17:25.750 --> 01:17:26.875
Shy!

01:17:32.291 --> 01:17:33.375
Shy!

01:17:36.333 --> 01:17:37.291
Shy?

01:17:37.791 --> 01:17:39.375
-Shy!
-Shy.

01:17:40.416 --> 01:17:41.625
Shy!

01:17:44.375 --> 01:17:45.541
Shy?

01:17:51.583 --> 01:17:52.458
Shy!

01:17:54.666 --> 01:17:55.875
Shy!

01:17:57.041 --> 01:17:58.208
Shy.

01:17:58.291 --> 01:17:59.375
Shy!

01:18:02.208 --> 01:18:03.208
Shy!

01:18:09.791 --> 01:18:11.750
-I'm going to call the police.
-No, no, no.

01:18:11.833 --> 01:18:15.000
Check the attic, check the cellar.
I'm gonna look around here.

01:18:17.333 --> 01:18:18.166
Shy!

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:21.958
Shy!

01:18:28.333 --> 01:18:29.458
Shy!

01:18:32.875 --> 01:18:34.125
Shy!

01:18:37.875 --> 01:18:38.958
Shy!

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:43.541
Shy!

01:19:27.416 --> 01:19:28.875
If I could go back…

01:19:29.791 --> 01:19:31.166
Uh…

01:19:32.541 --> 01:19:34.250
I'd just…

01:19:34.333 --> 01:19:39.000
I would go to my nana's house
and just… spend time.

01:19:42.375 --> 01:19:43.916
I would sit…

01:19:45.541 --> 01:19:47.416
in my nana's house.

01:19:51.208 --> 01:19:54.000
And just listen to her…

01:19:55.291 --> 01:19:56.458
chatting.

01:19:56.958 --> 01:19:59.666
Just smell her house.

01:20:02.708 --> 01:20:05.041
Eat her soft, manky Bourbon biscuits.

01:20:05.125 --> 01:20:06.083
Just…

01:20:18.833 --> 01:20:21.416
I would just maybe pack it all up and…

01:20:23.166 --> 01:20:26.583
Pack it into a caravan,
take it out on the road. You know?

01:20:26.666 --> 01:20:29.000
Thelma and Louise-style geography class.

01:20:29.958 --> 01:20:32.083
Full speed into the abyss.

01:21:07.541 --> 01:21:09.041
Dad! Daddy!

01:21:09.125 --> 01:21:10.583
-Hi, there! Hi, there!
-Daddy!

01:21:10.666 --> 01:21:11.583
-Dad!
-Daddy!

01:21:11.666 --> 01:21:13.291
How are we? How is everyone?

01:21:13.375 --> 01:21:14.541
Daddy.

01:21:14.625 --> 01:21:15.833
-Dad.
-Yeah.

01:21:15.916 --> 01:21:17.083
-Dad!
-You're so muddy.

01:21:17.166 --> 01:21:19.041
-I know. So muddy.
-Why are you muddy?

01:21:19.125 --> 01:21:20.458
It looks quite yucky.

01:21:20.541 --> 01:21:21.416
Yuck.

01:21:22.166 --> 01:21:23.625
-Come on, girls.
-Thanks, Mum.

01:21:23.708 --> 01:21:24.833
We've got muffins today!

01:21:24.916 --> 01:21:27.083
-Christ, Dad looks fresh.
-We've got muffins.

01:21:27.166 --> 01:21:29.583
-Morning.
-Late one? Tricky one? Fire? Murder?

01:21:29.666 --> 01:21:31.291
-Everyone okay?
-All good.

01:21:31.375 --> 01:21:32.833
How come you're muddy?

01:21:32.916 --> 01:21:35.250
Oh, it's just… It's fine.

01:21:35.333 --> 01:21:36.916
-Everyone okay?
-Yeah.

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:38.875
-One of those?
-Yeah, one of those.

01:21:38.958 --> 01:21:41.625
-Come on. We're gonna be late.
-Come on, girls. Let's go.

01:21:41.708 --> 01:21:45.458
Remember, be good, be kind, be clever,
be brilliant at everything, especially…

01:21:45.541 --> 01:21:46.833
-Running.
-No, especially…

01:21:46.916 --> 01:21:47.916
Very special painting.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:51.083
No, especially science, yeah?
And inventions.

01:21:51.750 --> 01:21:53.416
Sleep. Sleep all day. Do nothing.

01:21:53.500 --> 01:21:55.333
-Then cook for us, okay?
-I will. Okay.

01:21:55.416 --> 01:21:56.333
-Love you.
-Love you.

01:21:56.416 --> 01:21:59.666
Now, let's go. Come on, girls.
We're gonna be late. Let's go!

01:21:59.750 --> 01:22:01.458
-Let's go.
-Bye, Daddy!

01:22:01.541 --> 01:22:04.166
-We haven't got science.
-Chop-chop. Your rucksack strap.

01:22:44.291 --> 01:22:46.708
All right, so, Shola, it's Steve.

01:22:46.791 --> 01:22:49.250
You already know that,
so blah, blah, blah.

01:22:49.333 --> 01:22:52.625
Um, look, ignore this
or listen to it as you please.

01:22:52.708 --> 01:22:57.500
There's absolutely no pressure from me.
So, Ash. Right, you'll-- you'll love Ash.

01:22:57.583 --> 01:23:00.083
He's one of those kids
who's all chip and grift,

01:23:00.166 --> 01:23:02.625
and he'd, like,
nick the shirt off your back.

01:23:02.708 --> 01:23:07.791
He's a proper fucking scally,
but he's so smart and funny.

01:23:08.500 --> 01:23:10.166
And he's just great craic.

01:23:11.041 --> 01:23:14.375
Benny. Benny's got a big presence
in the house.

01:23:14.458 --> 01:23:18.000
Sometimes he's more… kind of more
like the staff than a student.

01:23:18.083 --> 01:23:20.625
And you need Benny
on your side in a crisis

01:23:20.708 --> 01:23:22.583
'cause he can sort stuff, you know?

01:23:22.666 --> 01:23:26.208
He lost his dad a while ago,
and he never got to say goodbye.

01:23:26.291 --> 01:23:27.583
I think his dad was inside.

01:23:27.666 --> 01:23:31.541
So, in there,
there's just a grieving kid, you know?

01:23:31.625 --> 01:23:35.291
Riley, oh, man, this kid. This kid.

01:23:35.375 --> 01:23:39.541
Riley is powered by a different kind
of engine than the rest of us.

01:23:39.625 --> 01:23:44.208
He is a fascinating, beautiful kid,
and he's… he's relentless.

01:23:44.291 --> 01:23:47.583
He's fighting all the time
with himself or with the others.

01:23:47.666 --> 01:23:49.791
He's got this kind of mad momentum.

01:23:49.875 --> 01:23:52.833
It's attack, attack, attack all the time.
He's always on.

01:23:52.916 --> 01:23:54.416
He's like the wild boy, you know?

01:23:54.500 --> 01:23:57.500
Encyclopedic knowledge.
Cornish and proud. So clever.

01:23:57.583 --> 01:24:01.041
Nabeel. You're gonna love Nabeel, Shola.

01:24:01.125 --> 01:24:03.833
He's Mr. Cool, Mr. Smooth.

01:24:03.916 --> 01:24:06.541
And he's very strong academically
when he tries.

01:24:07.250 --> 01:24:10.458
Jamie. I earn my fucking salary
on Jamie alone.

01:24:10.541 --> 01:24:12.166
If there's a fight, he started it.

01:24:12.250 --> 01:24:15.375
If there's a weakness, he'll find it.
But I adore him.

01:24:15.458 --> 01:24:18.125
He's very insightful and wise,
and he can read people.

01:24:18.208 --> 01:24:19.958
That's how he pushes their buttons.

01:24:20.041 --> 01:24:23.500
I'd like him to knuckle down, obviously.
He could get very good results.

01:24:23.583 --> 01:24:26.083
He talks about business studies
or something like that.

01:24:26.166 --> 01:24:30.125
He can remember insane details.
Ask him anything about hip-hop. Anything.

01:24:33.375 --> 01:24:34.541
All right, Shy.

01:24:35.666 --> 01:24:39.041
It seems like I've known Shy forever.

01:24:42.500 --> 01:24:43.541
Where to start?

01:24:43.625 --> 01:24:46.041
-What's that? Oh, fuck! Guys!
-Oh, boy.

01:24:46.125 --> 01:24:47.041
Holy shit!

01:24:47.125 --> 01:24:49.458
-Who the fuck's throwing that?
-Oh, shit.

01:24:49.541 --> 01:24:51.791
-What the fuck?
-There's glass everywhere!

01:24:58.833 --> 01:25:00.583
Oh, shit! Oh, shit, it's Shy!

01:25:00.666 --> 01:25:01.833
Shy! Shy!

01:25:01.916 --> 01:25:03.833
Shy, what the fuck?

01:25:08.166 --> 01:25:11.000
There's like this
reserve of sadness in Shy.

01:25:11.083 --> 01:25:16.708
Like he's seen the whole, bleak,
terrible truth of the universe.

01:25:16.791 --> 01:25:17.750
And he's right.

01:25:17.833 --> 01:25:20.750
Like, when Shy tells you
why things are fucked,

01:25:20.833 --> 01:25:24.166
it's… it's hard to argue with him.

01:25:29.083 --> 01:25:31.083
Shy!

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:41.458
But he's so sharp and insightful
when he wants to be.

01:25:41.541 --> 01:25:43.958
And he's got, like… I don't know.

01:25:44.041 --> 01:25:47.083
Just, he's got, like, a… a generous pain,

01:25:47.166 --> 01:25:48.416
if that makes sense.

01:25:48.500 --> 01:25:52.375
And I just pray
for the weather in his head to be kind.

01:25:52.458 --> 01:25:53.958
To clear for a bit, you know?

01:25:54.041 --> 01:25:56.500
For luck. Because when Shy's upset,

01:25:56.583 --> 01:25:59.291
it's like having a bomb
go off in the house.

01:26:10.541 --> 01:26:15.500
And he has these horrifying night terrors,
and they sort of bleach into his days,

01:26:15.583 --> 01:26:17.375
and you'll see it.

01:26:17.458 --> 01:26:19.541
But the thing is, I get it, you know?

01:26:19.625 --> 01:26:22.208
I really get it,
and I just want to say to him,

01:26:22.958 --> 01:26:26.666
"There's so much,
and it's a lot, but hold tight,

01:26:26.750 --> 01:26:29.041
because you won't always feel like this."

01:26:29.125 --> 01:26:31.458
You know, and I'm lying to him, of course.

01:26:48.250 --> 01:26:50.583
You know what I'm saying,
I want all these lads,

01:26:50.666 --> 01:26:53.583
and my own kids, my little girls,
you know, it's the same,

01:26:53.666 --> 01:26:56.208
I want them to know
that there's something else.

01:27:15.125 --> 01:27:17.500
That there's, like, infinite things,

01:27:17.583 --> 01:27:20.708
music you can't even imagine
in other places,

01:27:20.791 --> 01:27:25.166
and the weather, and love,
and maybe nothing but ruin, but who knows?

01:27:25.250 --> 01:27:26.208
Who knows?

01:27:26.291 --> 01:27:30.416
The disaster changes shape,
and it becomes tomorrow's joy or whatever.

01:27:30.500 --> 01:27:33.333
And there's-- there's someone
you haven't met, and it's…

01:27:34.708 --> 01:27:37.416
It's, you know… You know what I'm saying.

01:27:37.500 --> 01:27:39.208
Anyway, I'm rambling.

01:27:39.291 --> 01:27:42.291
But it's enough, isn't it?

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:33.541
Out of sight, out of mind
Out of time, out of love

01:28:34.541 --> 01:28:36.833
Out of breath
Out of body, out of friends

01:28:36.916 --> 01:28:39.541
I can tell
That you don't get out as much

01:28:40.541 --> 01:28:42.916
With these rocks on your back
Weighing you down

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.750
'Cause you feel
All of you is not enough

01:28:46.583 --> 01:28:52.041
You're out of touch and out of sight
Out of mind, out of time, out of love

01:28:52.791 --> 01:28:55.916
Less is more unless you feel
That you're lesser than the rest

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.166
You think that you're out of clutch

01:28:59.041 --> 01:29:00.500
Out of money in your pocket

01:29:00.583 --> 01:29:04.041
Raging doesn't stop
Until you let the demons out your closet

01:29:04.958 --> 01:29:07.375
They out to get you
'Cause you putting out a message

01:29:07.458 --> 01:29:10.291
Like say the response won't affect you

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.541
Out of respect
You say you're out of sight

01:29:13.625 --> 01:29:16.208
Out of mind, out of time, out of love

01:29:20.583 --> 01:29:23.041
Hold on

01:29:23.541 --> 01:29:27.833
Don't leave too soon

01:29:32.666 --> 01:29:35.750
Your pain

01:29:35.833 --> 01:29:41.625
I feel it too

01:29:43.375 --> 01:29:46.916
Out of line, out of fight
Out of shrooms, out of wine

01:29:47.916 --> 01:29:50.875
All these feelings in your pocket
Weighing you down through this tunnel

01:29:50.958 --> 01:29:53.916
-Hope you make it out in time
-Hope you make it out in time

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.875
In this concrete jungle
Patience isn't kind

01:29:56.958 --> 01:29:59.833
-I hope you make it out alive
-I hope you make it out alive

01:29:59.916 --> 01:30:01.625
It's like they left you out to dry

01:30:01.708 --> 01:30:05.083
Is it you? Is it I?
Is it both of us combined?

01:30:06.500 --> 01:30:07.750
When you was down and out

01:30:07.833 --> 01:30:11.375
Couldn't be without
The darkest thoughts chasing you around

01:30:12.125 --> 01:30:13.791
I see the pressure on your face

01:30:13.875 --> 01:30:17.375
While you vet the crowd
Don't know if you should be in or out

01:30:18.458 --> 01:30:20.000
Asking to be shown a sign

01:30:20.083 --> 01:30:23.708
But it'll never be revealed
If you do not know your why

01:30:25.625 --> 01:30:29.750
So you're out of reach
Tryna find what you want out of life

01:30:30.708 --> 01:30:32.625
Out of sight, out of mind

01:30:34.041 --> 01:30:36.875
Hold on

01:30:36.958 --> 01:30:41.000
Don't leave too soon

01:30:46.083 --> 01:30:49.208
Your pain

01:30:49.291 --> 01:30:53.750
I feel it too

01:30:58.250 --> 01:31:00.791
Hold on

01:31:01.291 --> 01:31:05.625
Don't leave too soon

01:31:10.625 --> 01:31:13.416
Your pain

01:31:13.500 --> 01:31:18.000
I feel it too

01:31:21.208 --> 01:31:24.583
Out of sight, out of mind
Out of time, out of love

01:31:31.875 --> 01:31:34.083
With these rocks on your back
Weighing you down

01:31:34.166 --> 01:31:36.750
'Cause you feel
All of you is not enough

01:31:37.708 --> 01:31:39.458
You're out of touch

01:31:39.541 --> 01:31:43.041
Out of sight, out of mind
Out of time, out of love
