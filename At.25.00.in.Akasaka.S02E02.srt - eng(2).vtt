The incredibly popular actor, Hayama Asami...

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:07.630
is my lover.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.460
The story picks up after Ryoji and Takumi
got together in the last installment.

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:13.960
I'm so excited!

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.250
I never thought the four of us would get to work together again.

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:18.830
The real ordeal is just getting started.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.080
I have to survive in this business.

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:24.830
Are you heading out?

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.670
Akeno-san is here to pick me up.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.580
Asami-san, your phone.

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:34.130
Sorry. Thank you.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:38.540
Take care.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:50.880
Huh?

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.880
Asami-san? Is something wrong?

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:58.630
Hayama?

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:07.380
Hayama, hurry up.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.920
We're going to be late.

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:14.540
Sorry.

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:21.880
Shirasaki.

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.790
Be careful on your way home.

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.250
Okay.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.630
Are you okay?

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.830
I'll go talk to Akeno-san with you.

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:56.460
Sorry for the wait.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.330
Not at all.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.960
We've locked in your next commercial.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.790
The client meeting is next,
so be prepared.

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:13.790
Akeno-san.

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:15.710
What is it?

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.670
It's about Shirasaki.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.540
I...

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:29.880
Break up with him.

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.830
Break up with Shirasaki.

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.790
"At 25:00, in Akasaka" Season 2
(Episode 2)

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.670
Break up...?

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.460
Normally, your private life is none of my business.

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.170
But...

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.710
This is the worst possible time for a scandal.

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:59.210
You understand that, don't you?

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.580
You've worked so hard to
become the lead in a romance drama.

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:10.000
You're on so many magazine covers.

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.290
You've become a brand ambassador.

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.790
You're shooting commercials.

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:21.290
All of this is because Hayama Asami
has market value.

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:28.380
Your fans and the audience have a certain image of you.

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.670
You can't destroy that image now, can you?

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.880
I...

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.500
I'm not an idol.

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.500
I'm just an actor.

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:43.420
And I'm just a normal person.

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:47.130
I understand.

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:49.750
But...

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.920
There are so many people
who project their ideals onto you.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.710
They build their dreams around you.

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:04.290
They look to you for comfort.

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:07.710
And many people see Shirasaki the same way.

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:12.130
I hate to say this, but...

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:14.920
when it comes to homosexuality,

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.580
societal acceptance still has a long way to go.

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.330
For now, put some distance between you and Shirasaki.

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.540
And then, think things through carefully.

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:44.330
It's okay.

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.000
There's nothing to worry about.

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:32.460
Morning.

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:35.380
- Hayama, morning.
- Morning.

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:37.500
- Morning, Shirasaki.
- Morning.

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:38.670
Morning.

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:39.710
- Hey, you alright?
- Morning.

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:41.380
- Morning.
- Morning.

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:42.750
I know where we're shooting today.

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:43.670
Where?

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:44.460
A campsite.

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:45.880
Huh? Oh...

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:46.880
A campsite, huh?

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:47.830
It's gorgeous.

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:49.330
Wow, I can't wait.

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:51.420
I wonder if there's a hot spring or something.

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:52.500
There is.

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:54.210
There is?

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:58.750
What did Akeno-san say?

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:31.750
Just give me a little more time.

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:54.790
Hayama-san, is your relationship with him real?

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:56.040
Can you please comment?

00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:57.080
Please answer!

00:07:57.210 --> 00:07:58.500
- Is it true?
- Please answer!

00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:00.290
- Say something!
- Hayama-san, is this true?

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:02.130
- Please say something!
- What's going on?

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:03.790
Please explain!

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:05.040
What is really going on?

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:20.330
Morning.

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:24.130
Yuki, I'm hungry.

00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:25.710
Not my problem.

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:27.380
We're having barbecue soon, aren't we?

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:28.710
Just wait until then.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.080
I know, but I can't wait.
Can I have a taste now?

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:32.040
What? What are you talking about?

00:08:32.170 --> 00:08:33.040
Why? Can't I?

00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:33.880
No way!

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:34.630
Come on.

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:35.170
Don't "come on" me.

00:08:35.290 --> 00:08:36.250
Pleeease?

00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:38.710
Huh?

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:40.880
I never heard about this.

00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:43.540
Is that so?

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:46.000
Why didn't you tell me?

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:49.630
Ryoji.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.040
- Okay, cut!
- Cut.

00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:56.080
- Okay, that's a take!
- Okay.

00:08:56.210 --> 00:08:57.750
Reset for the next scene.

00:08:58.830 --> 00:08:59.830
Ah...

00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:13.210
Let's break up.

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:20.420
Let's break up.

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:30.040
You...

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:33.790
You can't be serious.

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:38.170
If we stay together...

00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:42.750
we'll cause trouble for the people we care about.

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:48.080
There are so many people
who project their ideals onto you.

00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:49.880
They build their dreams around you.

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:53.580
They look to you for comfort.

00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:56.630
And many people see Shirasaki the same way.

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:09.420
Asami-san?

00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:26.330
She said we should break up.

00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:29.210
Huh?

00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:33.670
She said it would affect both of our careers.

00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:41.750
Asami-san, I...

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:42.710
Hayama.

00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:45.750
Shirasaki, we're ready for the barbecue scene.

00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:47.540
Okay.

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:50.920
Asami-san?

00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:54.790
Let's go.

00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:07.790
Here, it's ready.

00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:10.750
Thanks.

00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:13.880
Cheers.

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:16.250
Cheers.

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:18.880
Okay, cut!

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.210
Cut...

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:21.710
That's a take.

00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:23.630
- Okay.
- Nothing beats a cold beer.

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:25.000
You got that right.

00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:27.290
- This is really good.
- It's dripping all over.

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:29.960
Mmm... delicious.

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:32.630
- Try this too.
- This?

00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:34.460
- It's good.
- Yeah.

00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:35.920
You're going to kiss me later, you know.

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:37.330
I know, I know.

00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:38.750
- You do?
- Of course I do.

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:47.080
I'm in love with you.

00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:50.460
I love you.

00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:52.630
If...

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:56.630
you say you're joking again, I'll kill you.

00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:15.630
- Okay, cut!
- Cut...

00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:17.420
- Oof.
- Great work.

00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:23.670
Sakuma.

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:24.880
What's wrong?

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:25.830
It's nothing.

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:28.630
- This bed is amazing...
- Huh?

00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:30.500
- What?
- I'm suddenly so sleepy.

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:34.080
How can you be sleepy right after kissing me?

00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:34.960
I can't...

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:36.130
- Hey.
- I'm gonna sleep...

00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:37.830
Hey, wake up.

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:40.170
Wake up, Sakuma.

00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:42.420
Hey, Sakuma.

00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:07.330
So, about your first leading role in *Daydream*...

00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:10.130
What kind of project was it
for you, Hayama-san?

00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:15.630
For me, it was a very special
and incredibly important project.

00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:16.960
What part of it

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:19.210
made it so special for you?

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:22.130
Well...

00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:28.460
While working opposite my co-star, Shirasaki,

00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:31.080
I was reminded of something.

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:32.710
I was reminded of why I started.

00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:38.040
That simple desire to just act.

00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:40.290
And I rediscovered

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:42.290
what's truly important to me.

00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:47.170
Through the process
of filming *Daydream*,

00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:49.330
I feel like I found the answers.

00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:03.830
For now, put some distance between you and Shirasaki.

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:14.750
Even if we're far apart,

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:16.670
Daddy's heart

00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:18.380
will always be with you, Asami,

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:19.750
and your mom.

00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:42.460
If we stay together...

00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:44.790
we'll cause trouble for the people we care about.

00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:11.210
Picture's up!

00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:12.670
Camera set.

00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:14.000
And...

00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:15.830
Scene 56, take 1.

00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:17.960
And...

00:15:18.130 --> 00:15:19.500
Action!

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:26.130
Let's break up.

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:32.580
Let's just break up.

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:42.040
If we stay together,

00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:47.250
we'll just cause trouble for the people we care about.

00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:54.130
For both our sakes,

00:15:55.630 --> 00:15:57.460
it's better if we break up.

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:06.040
This has to be...

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:11.250
It has to be...

00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:16.210
the best thing for both of us.

00:16:26.830 --> 00:16:28.250
I understand.

00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:33.580
Let's break up.

00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:44.170
Goodbye.

00:16:58.040 --> 00:16:59.000
Director.

00:16:59.130 --> 00:17:01.170
That's not the blocking we did in rehearsal.

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:30.420
Thank you for everything.

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:36.380
Goodbye.

00:17:50.830 --> 00:17:52.040
Cut!

00:17:57.920 --> 00:17:59.210
And... we're good.

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:03.250
Hayama-san, Shirasaki.

00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:05.670
That scene was fantastic.

00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:08.920
Thank you, Director.

00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:45.500
Shirasaki.

00:18:48.290 --> 00:18:50.130
That last scene...

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:52.630
You were incredible.

00:18:55.710 --> 00:18:56.960
Asami-san.

00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:03.040
It was just acting.

00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:08.960
I'm not breaking up with you.

00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:14.460
Although...

00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:17.790
we still need to be careful not to get caught.

00:19:57.630 --> 00:19:59.880
What Akeno-san said to me...

00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:02.830
I've given it a lot of thought.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.540
I see.

00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:08.040
And?

00:20:08.170 --> 00:20:09.880
Are you two going to keep your distance?

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:12.380
No.

00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:17.920
If we create distance,

00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:21.040
we'll just grow apart.

00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:24.580
So...

00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:26.630
we're staying together.

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:30.540
On that premise,

00:20:30.670 --> 00:20:32.580
we'll protect both of our acting careers.

00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:37.920
Can you really pull that off?

00:20:41.130 --> 00:20:42.670
I will.

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:55.170
Thank you so much... for your concern.

00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:57.580
It's nothing.

00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:01.960
I just don't want
your market value to drop.

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:09.460
You need to protect...

00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:12.040
Shirasaki.

00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:14.580
And yourself.

00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:19.880
Mm.

00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:24.040
I will.

00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:30.330
Well then... this conversation is over.

00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:35.330
Akeno-san.

00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:40.380
Thank you.

00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:54.210
Yamase...

00:21:54.330 --> 00:21:55.790
Hurry up.

00:21:57.330 --> 00:21:58.170
It's lit.

00:21:59.250 --> 00:22:01.000
- I'm grabbing one.
- Go on.

00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:09.000
I'm lighting it.

00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:18.500
So pretty.

00:22:19.130 --> 00:22:20.000
It's lit!

00:22:27.170 --> 00:22:27.880
Careful.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:28.960
It's hot...

00:22:35.670 --> 00:22:36.710
Dangerous.

00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:38.710
Whoa, it's huge.

00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:46.500
The flame!

00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:47.540
Can I get a light?

00:22:50.210 --> 00:22:51.460
Sure.

00:22:58.750 --> 00:22:59.750
So pretty.

00:23:04.670 --> 00:23:05.500
Intense.

00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:07.080
Shirasaki.

00:23:08.710 --> 00:23:09.710
Yeah?

00:23:10.250 --> 00:23:13.750
I've been thinking a lot about our situation.

00:23:15.710 --> 00:23:17.330
Why don't you move?

00:23:18.250 --> 00:23:19.630
Huh?

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:22.830
Why don't we live together?

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:24.130
With me.

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:29.080
(This story is a work of fiction.)

00:23:30.750 --> 00:23:31.710
(Next Episode)
I'm home.

00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:32.500
Welcome home.

00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:34.290
Acting all cute like that...

00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:36.210
when there's nothing I can do
puts me in a tough spot.

00:23:36.330 --> 00:23:37.500
Your mouth isn't busy, is it?

00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:39.710
This one. "Stage Play: Rain and Confession.
Director: Aoyama Ruiichiro."

00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:41.580
I want to audition for this.

00:23:41.710 --> 00:23:42.920
They're casting a total of four actors.

00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:44.960
It seems experience doesn't factor in.

00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:46.630
- They're casting entirely by audition.
- I'm going for it.

00:23:46.750 --> 00:23:48.040
Please let me audition.

00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:49.540
You're Shirasaki, right?

00:23:49.670 --> 00:23:52.420
I've always hoped
I'd get to act with you someday.

00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:53.500
Well, if it isn't Shirasaki.

00:23:54.130 --> 00:23:56.080
I hope we get to share the stage.
