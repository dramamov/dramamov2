WEBVTT

00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:04.254
Mister Dipong,
tell me how Ma'am Ingrid was as a boss.

00:00:04.337 --> 00:00:07.841
Patrick, I've already
told you everything I know.

00:00:07.924 --> 00:00:10.176
Two butterflies on top of each other.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.428
If it really was hers,

00:00:11.511 --> 00:00:12.721
then she probably left it with Mia.

00:00:12.804 --> 00:00:14.848
"Shadows Behind the New Face."

00:00:14.931 --> 00:00:17.058
Did Ma'am Ingrid write
about what she did before?

00:00:17.142 --> 00:00:18.935
What kind of person are you?

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:20.186
Let's take a family photo.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.063
The three of us, you, me, and Matmat.

00:00:22.147 --> 00:00:23.022
No.

00:00:23.106 --> 00:00:24.607
Something happened at the hospital.

00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:27.360
The person you want to file
a case against is already dead.

00:00:27.444 --> 00:00:29.446
What if she changed her face?
Had plastic surgery?

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:32.949
Then we need
to prove that Ingrid Hernandez

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:36.411
and that person are one and the same.

00:01:39.516 --> 00:01:41.518
I need to find her, Mia.

00:01:42.352 --> 00:01:44.771
Whether she's in the hospital or not,

00:01:45.897 --> 00:01:49.275
she must pay for
what she's done to my family.

00:01:51.945 --> 00:01:53.822
I'm so happy…

00:01:54.364 --> 00:01:57.450
that you and Matmat
are living here with me.

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:02.664
I'm so happy to be making
new memories in this house.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.376
I never liked it here.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.881
Why? Weren't you happy here before?

00:02:11.965 --> 00:02:15.468
This is a horrible place for a child.

00:02:18.388 --> 00:02:21.558
This is where Papa lost his mind.

00:02:24.477 --> 00:02:26.855
This is where Mama died.

00:02:29.607 --> 00:02:31.401
She really died here?

00:02:33.236 --> 00:02:34.821
As far as I know.

00:02:35.446 --> 00:02:38.867
Even though
we didn't get to bury her body.

00:02:42.162 --> 00:02:43.371
She's dead.

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.460
What if she comes back one day…

00:02:51.254 --> 00:02:52.964
and she's alive?

00:02:55.091 --> 00:02:58.720
I don't want to live
a life where she exists.

00:03:03.224 --> 00:03:04.934
But then again…

00:03:07.937 --> 00:03:10.732
…she brought me into this world.

00:03:13.276 --> 00:03:15.278
She is my mother.

00:03:33.963 --> 00:03:35.256
Patrick…

00:03:36.925 --> 00:03:38.176
Patrick.

00:03:38.927 --> 00:03:40.220
Patrick!

00:03:40.803 --> 00:03:42.180
Patrick, wake up!

00:03:43.014 --> 00:03:44.849
Hey! Get dressed!

00:03:45.225 --> 00:03:46.142
Come on!

00:03:46.476 --> 00:03:48.353
{\an8}Patrick, come on. Get dressed.

00:03:50.146 --> 00:03:53.107
{\an8}I know that today is your free day.

00:03:53.191 --> 00:03:55.944
{\an8}So, there's no other day but today.

00:03:56.027 --> 00:03:59.280
{\an8}P-Patpat, get out of bed

00:03:59.364 --> 00:04:02.283
{\an8}so Mia will stop shouting.

00:04:02.367 --> 00:04:03.826
{\an8}I'll get dressed.

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:06.412
{\an8}Matmat, you too.

00:04:06.496 --> 00:04:08.998
{\an8}

00:04:09.082 --> 00:04:13.461
{\an8}G-Get up.
It's time for our family picture.

00:04:13.544 --> 00:04:16.256
{\an8}M-Matmat will take a shower now.

00:04:18.174 --> 00:04:23.179
{\an8}-

00:04:23.888 --> 00:04:24.764
{\an8}Mm…

00:04:33.106 --> 00:04:34.315
{\an8}

00:04:34.983 --> 00:04:38.278
{\an8}Matmat, you look so handsome.

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:40.488
{\an8}

00:04:40.571 --> 00:04:43.283
{\an8}I told you this would look good on you.

00:04:44.534 --> 00:04:46.286
{\an8}Thank you, Mia.

00:04:47.287 --> 00:04:51.374
{\an8}Patpat isn't ready yet.

00:04:51.791 --> 00:04:52.917
{\an8}What?

00:04:53.001 --> 00:04:54.335
{\an8}He's not ready yet.

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:55.545
{\an8}

00:04:55.628 --> 00:04:56.838
{\an8}Patrick?

00:04:56.921 --> 00:04:57.797
{\an8}Patpat?

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.340
{\an8}

00:04:59.424 --> 00:05:01.426
{\an8}Patrick, get dressed already.

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:04.887
{\an8}Patrick, get dressed!

00:05:05.847 --> 00:05:08.016
{\an8}What's wrong? You've been
acting strange since yesterday.

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:08.933
{\an8}Nothing.

00:05:09.017 --> 00:05:10.727
Alright, come on.

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:13.646
Get dressed.
I want to take this family picture.

00:05:15.898 --> 00:05:17.650
Are we doing this or not?

00:05:21.487 --> 00:05:22.780
Mia, please. Not today.

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.785
Not today,

00:05:28.453 --> 00:05:30.204
or not at all?

00:05:37.503 --> 00:05:38.504
Matmat, let's go.

00:05:38.588 --> 00:05:42.884
{\an8}P-Patpat, why don't
you want to take a family picture?

00:05:42.967 --> 00:05:45.470
{\an8}We're Mia's family, right?

00:05:46.763 --> 00:05:50.808
{\an8}F-Family members help each other.

00:05:51.559 --> 00:05:54.812
{\an8}We need to help
Mia with the family picture.

00:05:54.896 --> 00:05:58.107
M-Matmat will help her,

00:05:59.108 --> 00:06:01.027
even if Patpat doesn't want to.

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:07.950
Let's go, Matmat.

00:06:09.327 --> 00:06:11.120
M-Mia.

00:06:16.834 --> 00:06:21.130
Let's just continue the photo shoot
for our book instead, okay?

00:06:23.466 --> 00:06:26.552
F-For our book?

00:06:26.636 --> 00:06:32.141
Y-You're going to put
Matmat's face on the book?

00:06:32.225 --> 00:06:34.519
Of course, Matmat.

00:06:35.144 --> 00:06:37.271
You are my illustrator, right?

00:06:38.272 --> 00:06:41.275
I'll also have my pictures
taken so we'll both have new ones.

00:06:41.359 --> 00:06:44.195
O-Okay.

00:06:44.278 --> 00:06:48.825
M-Matmat can use the smile we practiced.

00:06:48.908 --> 00:06:51.786
One, two, three.

00:06:52.662 --> 00:06:54.705
One, two, three.

00:07:11.806 --> 00:07:15.601
M-Matmat's
going to be on a book cover?

00:07:17.895 --> 00:07:25.027
Mia, Matmat practiced
his smile for the picture.

00:07:25.111 --> 00:07:26.904
Want to see it?

00:07:26.988 --> 00:07:28.322
Sure, Matmat.

00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:30.992
One, two, three.

00:07:35.246 --> 00:07:37.165
O-One, two, three.

00:07:41.461 --> 00:07:43.588
O-One, two, three.

00:07:47.884 --> 00:07:50.845
M-Mia doesn't like it?

00:07:52.096 --> 00:07:54.432
All of your smiles are fake, Matmat.

00:07:55.183 --> 00:07:59.020
But Matmat practiced.

00:07:59.479 --> 00:08:05.109
Matmat practiced a lot
for the pictures for our book.

00:08:07.278 --> 00:08:09.280
You will look good, Matmat.

00:08:11.532 --> 00:08:13.534
As long as you be yourself.

00:08:13.618 --> 00:08:15.661
Be myself.

00:08:19.081 --> 00:08:20.875
The true Matmat.

00:08:22.627 --> 00:08:24.170
Ready, Miss Mia?

00:08:27.048 --> 00:08:28.549
Are you ready, Matmat?

00:08:28.633 --> 00:08:30.384
W-Wait.

00:08:30.468 --> 00:08:34.180
Wait a minute, Mister Photographer.

00:08:34.263 --> 00:08:36.349
Don't take our picture yet.

00:08:36.849 --> 00:08:38.100
Matmat?

00:08:38.184 --> 00:08:41.687
It's okay. I told them
it's just the two of us today.

00:08:41.771 --> 00:08:46.526
T-There will be three of us today.

00:08:46.609 --> 00:08:49.320
Matmat, it's just us.

00:08:50.196 --> 00:08:51.197
Hmm…

00:08:53.908 --> 00:08:54.784
There he is!

00:08:54.867 --> 00:08:58.621
Patpat is here!

00:09:53.009 --> 00:09:54.176
You made it.

00:09:56.387 --> 00:09:58.055
Satsat swayed me.

00:10:37.887 --> 00:10:39.221
"Patrick,

00:10:39.305 --> 00:10:41.891
ever since you gave me Satsat,

00:10:42.642 --> 00:10:45.770
I haven't had any bad dreams.

00:10:46.395 --> 00:10:49.315
And now Satsat is here to tell you

00:10:50.066 --> 00:10:53.027
that I'm happy to be with you and Matmat.

00:10:55.154 --> 00:10:57.406
You two are my family.

00:10:58.991 --> 00:11:00.368
By the way,

00:11:00.451 --> 00:11:02.411
Satsat doesn't have a suit yet,

00:11:02.495 --> 00:11:05.456
so he can't join the family picture.

00:11:06.082 --> 00:11:08.918
But you'll give him back to me, okay?"

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.795
Good thing
Satsat delivered my message.

00:11:55.506 --> 00:12:00.010
P-Patpat looks dashing.

00:12:00.094 --> 00:12:03.889
My-My little brother looks so dashing.

00:12:03.973 --> 00:12:07.476
So-So handsome.

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.395
You're still twice
as handsome as me, Matmat.

00:12:09.478 --> 00:12:11.439
This shirt looks great on you.

00:12:11.522 --> 00:12:15.234
M-Matmat
practiced smiling for the picture

00:12:15.317 --> 00:12:17.945
so we could both look handsome.

00:12:18.028 --> 00:12:20.364
So we brothers would look good.

00:12:20.448 --> 00:12:24.910
Mr. Photographer,
my brother looks so handsome.

00:12:24.994 --> 00:12:26.912
Yes, sir!

00:12:26.996 --> 00:12:28.247
Miss Mia?

00:12:30.666 --> 00:12:33.085
Let's take our family photo first.

00:12:33.169 --> 00:12:34.795
Sure, ma'am.

00:12:34.879 --> 00:12:36.255
Let's go?

00:12:38.174 --> 00:12:39.884
Stand beside me, Matmat.

00:13:04.492 --> 00:13:07.077
Mia's part of my family now, Ma.

00:13:09.914 --> 00:13:12.750
She and Matmat are the
most important to me right now.

00:13:20.674 --> 00:13:22.092
But, Ma,

00:13:22.176 --> 00:13:24.803
once I prove
that Ma'am Ingrid is still alive,

00:13:25.679 --> 00:13:28.057
I want her to pay
for what she did to you.

00:13:30.017 --> 00:13:34.647
I know Mia might be affected by this,

00:13:36.941 --> 00:13:38.984
but I will protect her, Ma.

00:13:44.657 --> 00:13:46.534
I don't want her to get hurt.

00:13:50.037 --> 00:13:51.622
Ready, sir?

00:13:51.705 --> 00:13:54.083
Both of you,
please stand closer to Miss Mia.

00:13:55.334 --> 00:13:57.503
Big smiles for your family picture!

00:13:57.920 --> 00:13:59.672
Happy day!

00:13:59.755 --> 00:14:01.507
Yes, say "happy day!"

00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:03.842
Happy day!

00:14:11.892 --> 00:14:14.144
Yes, I saw the books you left, Madeth.

00:14:14.228 --> 00:14:17.064
I'll give them to Matmat
so he can use them as a reference.

00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:19.066
Okay, thanks.

00:14:23.988 --> 00:14:26.824
Does that book hold
a special place in your heart?

00:14:28.158 --> 00:14:30.244
I wouldn't be surprised if it does.

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:32.663
Why do you say that?

00:14:32.746 --> 00:14:34.665
Because you and Happy are alike.

00:14:34.748 --> 00:14:39.461
You don't easily
open up about your feelings.

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:45.926
I asked Jason what's going on with you.

00:14:47.219 --> 00:14:49.138
Why you're upset.

00:14:51.056 --> 00:14:52.600
Since when did you two get close?

00:14:53.225 --> 00:14:54.727
Hmm…

00:14:54.810 --> 00:14:57.855
Maybe since
I ordered so much chicken inasal.

00:14:58.606 --> 00:14:59.732
Mm.

00:15:01.066 --> 00:15:04.194
Okay then. What did he tell you?

00:15:04.278 --> 00:15:07.156
He told me that, as your best friend,

00:15:08.032 --> 00:15:11.452
he just waits for you to open up

00:15:11.535 --> 00:15:13.704
about how you feel.

00:15:15.122 --> 00:15:17.458
He said that's the best way to help

00:15:18.125 --> 00:15:19.627
and support you.

00:15:22.338 --> 00:15:24.131
And I think he's right.

00:15:25.466 --> 00:15:27.968
- That best friend of yours--
- I'm tired.

00:15:32.848 --> 00:15:34.975
I'm tired of taking care

00:15:35.851 --> 00:15:38.562
and protecting the people around me

00:15:41.774 --> 00:15:43.609
just because it's expected.

00:15:47.071 --> 00:15:49.198
I don't want that kind
of responsibility anymore.

00:15:52.785 --> 00:15:54.370
So from now on…

00:15:56.413 --> 00:15:58.958
I'll protect them
because it's what I want.

00:16:01.835 --> 00:16:03.462
Because I love them.

00:16:05.547 --> 00:16:08.175
Am I one of those people you'll protect?

00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:22.523
We already have a family picture,
don't we?

00:16:25.109 --> 00:16:27.403
Mia, you're part of our family now.

00:16:29.613 --> 00:16:30.656
You…

00:16:31.949 --> 00:16:33.075
Matmat,

00:16:33.909 --> 00:16:35.160
and me?

00:16:41.917 --> 00:16:43.377
And Satsat.

00:16:44.003 --> 00:16:46.380
And Satsat, of course.

00:16:47.589 --> 00:16:49.758
I'm definitely buying him a suit.

00:16:49.842 --> 00:16:51.760
So he can join next time.

00:16:57.474 --> 00:16:59.476
Taking that family photo

00:17:00.853 --> 00:17:04.398
was the best decision
I've ever made in my life.

00:17:28.547 --> 00:17:29.673
Hurry up, Pogi!

00:17:33.052 --> 00:17:34.094
What?!

00:17:34.178 --> 00:17:35.763
- Gemma, assist Doc Emman.
- What's going on?!

00:17:35.846 --> 00:17:37.389
- Yes, ma'am.
- To the isolation room.

00:17:37.473 --> 00:17:39.892
- My patient needs me!
- No!

00:17:40.642 --> 00:17:41.810
Eden!

00:17:41.894 --> 00:17:44.021
Let me do my job!

00:17:44.104 --> 00:17:47.858
No! You do as I say, Olivia!

00:17:47.941 --> 00:17:48.776
But…

00:17:49.443 --> 00:17:52.446
I'm the nurse manager now, you know that.

00:17:52.529 --> 00:17:55.199
And I'm removing Samuel
from under your monitoring.

00:17:55.282 --> 00:17:57.159
- But--
- But what?!

00:17:58.869 --> 00:18:00.287
But what, Olivia?

00:18:09.797 --> 00:18:12.049
It's all from Ingrid.

00:18:13.759 --> 00:18:16.136
She's alive, Patrick.

00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:18.764
She's here, inside the hospital.

00:18:20.849 --> 00:18:23.268
Most of the women
in the hospital are nurses.

00:18:24.103 --> 00:18:27.231
But considering Ingrid's age,

00:18:27.314 --> 00:18:29.775
she can't be one of the young nurses.

00:18:29.858 --> 00:18:33.153
Eden! Let me do my job!

00:18:38.575 --> 00:18:40.953
You won, okay?
You're now the nurse manager.

00:18:41.036 --> 00:18:43.372
I didn't question your promotion.

00:18:43.455 --> 00:18:45.707
Are you really going
to take this away from me?

00:18:45.791 --> 00:18:49.253
This position is
mine from the very start.

00:18:50.003 --> 00:18:52.965
I worked harder than
you and anyone else here.

00:18:53.048 --> 00:18:55.092
So you have no right to question me.

00:18:55.175 --> 00:18:57.928
Whatever I have now, I deserve it.

00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:00.139
Think whatever you want,

00:19:00.222 --> 00:19:02.015
just return Samuel under my care.

00:19:02.099 --> 00:19:03.392
I will do anything.

00:19:03.475 --> 00:19:06.520
I'll even take extra shifts for free.

00:19:06.603 --> 00:19:08.689
There isn't much time left for Samuel.

00:19:08.772 --> 00:19:10.107
The way you're acting now

00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:12.317
proves I made the right call

00:19:12.401 --> 00:19:14.444
taking the patient out of your care.

00:19:14.862 --> 00:19:17.573
Eden, just let me have this.

00:19:18.574 --> 00:19:19.741
No.

00:19:19.825 --> 00:19:22.911
Do your job,
just like the other nurses here.

00:19:50.939 --> 00:19:53.025
There's more of that at home.
Vincent brought it.

00:19:53.108 --> 00:19:55.319
- Thank you.
- Give yourself a break.

00:19:58.572 --> 00:20:00.532
Miss Li, how long
have you been working here?

00:20:00.616 --> 00:20:03.577
I've been working
here for about ten years now.

00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:04.578
Mm…

00:20:05.829 --> 00:20:09.291
So, you've been here with
Ma'am Eden and Ma'am Olivia.

00:20:09.374 --> 00:20:12.085
- Since they began working here?
- Mm-hmm.

00:20:12.169 --> 00:20:13.295
Yeah.

00:20:14.129 --> 00:20:15.464
Why do you ask?

00:20:17.049 --> 00:20:19.301
I often notice them

00:20:19.927 --> 00:20:23.472
fighting over who will
take care of Mister Samuel.

00:20:24.139 --> 00:20:26.099
- I wonder why.
- Hmm…

00:20:26.183 --> 00:20:29.061
Gemma and I once talked about that.

00:20:29.144 --> 00:20:31.146
We're confused, too.

00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:35.984
But isn't it true you can
dislike someone for no reason?

00:20:36.068 --> 00:20:37.361
They might be like that.

00:20:37.444 --> 00:20:39.238
Maybe they don't like each other.

00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:42.866
Who among them started
working here at the hospital first?

00:20:43.909 --> 00:20:47.246
When it comes to seniority,

00:20:47.329 --> 00:20:51.166
Eden's been working
here for almost ten years.

00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:54.086
Olivia's only been
here around three years.

00:20:54.169 --> 00:20:55.170
She's new here.

00:20:56.797 --> 00:20:58.131
Are they locals?

00:20:58.882 --> 00:21:01.260
Not as far as I know.

00:21:01.343 --> 00:21:05.430
I think Olivia first
worked in different hospitals.

00:21:05.514 --> 00:21:08.100
And Eden… Let me think.

00:21:08.183 --> 00:21:10.185
I don't really know much about her.

00:21:15.565 --> 00:21:18.527
So, you've been here this whole time.

00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:19.945
Uh…

00:21:21.071 --> 00:21:22.656
Hi, Miss Li.

00:21:22.739 --> 00:21:24.908
Hello, Matmat. Hello, Mia.

00:21:24.992 --> 00:21:26.285
Hello…

00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:29.413
Miss Li.

00:21:29.496 --> 00:21:31.915
- Here's your food!
- Thank you, Miss Li.

00:21:31.999 --> 00:21:34.167
- Thank you, Miss Li.
- Thank you, Miss Li.

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:49.975
So, Mia's here.

00:21:52.102 --> 00:21:53.645
She's able to come in here,

00:21:53.729 --> 00:21:56.481
but she can't find
time to visit her own father.

00:21:59.192 --> 00:22:01.945
I've always try to convince her, ma'am.

00:22:05.115 --> 00:22:07.451
Tell me who is Matmat's real sibling.

00:22:08.785 --> 00:22:10.037
Miss Li…

00:22:10.662 --> 00:22:12.289
We are family.

00:22:13.206 --> 00:22:14.791
Mm. But,

00:22:14.875 --> 00:22:19.046
Matmat doesn't like an annoying sibling.

00:22:19.129 --> 00:22:20.464
Don't be annoying.

00:22:20.547 --> 00:22:22.924
She looks happy when she's with Patrick.

00:22:24.217 --> 00:22:25.761
Are they close?

00:22:28.722 --> 00:22:30.057
I think so.

00:22:31.558 --> 00:22:32.768
You think so?

00:22:33.435 --> 00:22:35.228
You mean, they're together?

00:22:35.312 --> 00:22:36.438
I'm not annoying.

00:22:54.956 --> 00:22:55.999
Hmm…

00:22:56.583 --> 00:22:59.795
What if I put the family photo here?

00:23:01.254 --> 00:23:02.839
Or probably over there?

00:23:03.632 --> 00:23:06.676
It's still a family photo
no matter where you put it.

00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:09.596
Actually, what if I have
this whole place renovated?

00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:12.599
And a designer to do the rooms?

00:23:13.725 --> 00:23:16.561
I can change it so
it matches both of our taste.

00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:19.481
- Both? You mean, us?
- Mm-hmm.

00:23:19.564 --> 00:23:20.982
I'll share my room.

00:23:21.066 --> 00:23:22.776
Mia, I don't like that idea.

00:23:22.859 --> 00:23:25.070
Why? Because it's spacious?

00:23:25.153 --> 00:23:26.780
Oh, Mia.
That's your parents' room.

00:23:26.863 --> 00:23:29.491
Of course, I won't be comfortable.

00:23:30.492 --> 00:23:32.786
But this whole house
belonged to them.

00:23:32.869 --> 00:23:36.289
Surely you remember them
wherever you look.

00:23:36.998 --> 00:23:38.416
Hmm…

00:23:39.543 --> 00:23:41.336
What if we move to a different house?

00:23:41.878 --> 00:23:43.797
Will you come with Matmat and me?

00:23:44.548 --> 00:23:46.967
Is it that time of the year again?

00:23:47.926 --> 00:23:50.345
Is Matmat having nightmares again?

00:23:51.138 --> 00:23:55.559
No. I'm just asking if
you want us to move to another house.

00:23:56.434 --> 00:23:58.395
I don't mind where we live.

00:23:59.396 --> 00:24:03.400
But you and Matmat don't have to leave.

00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:06.862
Because I'll kill
those butterflies myself

00:24:06.945 --> 00:24:08.613
before they can hurt Matmat.

00:24:16.746 --> 00:24:17.956
Don't.

00:24:18.915 --> 00:24:22.210
I might get scared if
you tear their wings off again.

00:24:24.296 --> 00:24:26.464
If you run away from me again,

00:24:27.257 --> 00:24:29.551
I really will follow you.

00:24:30.552 --> 00:24:31.970
But fine.

00:24:33.346 --> 00:24:36.474
I will never kill a butterfly, ever.

00:24:39.811 --> 00:24:41.104
Promise.

00:24:44.357 --> 00:24:47.235
Patrick, come on. Pinky promise.

00:24:52.324 --> 00:24:54.409
- I think something's missing.
- Mm?

00:24:54.492 --> 00:24:56.244
I think it needs a seal.

00:24:56.745 --> 00:24:57.787
Seal?

00:25:08.381 --> 00:25:10.133
That's the new seal now, huh?

00:25:19.309 --> 00:25:20.518
Mm.

00:25:21.895 --> 00:25:25.023
Patpat is like,

00:25:25.106 --> 00:25:27.025
a Saurolophus.

00:25:28.109 --> 00:25:33.531
The Saurolophus dinosaur
always looks like it's smiling,

00:25:33.615 --> 00:25:35.408
just like Patpat.

00:25:35.492 --> 00:25:39.788
Why is Patpat smiling? Is it because…

00:25:41.706 --> 00:25:44.417
he and Mia kissed.

00:25:46.211 --> 00:25:48.046
Mm.

00:25:49.256 --> 00:25:52.550
It's okay for Mia and Patpat to kiss,

00:25:52.634 --> 00:25:58.223
as long as Mia and Patpat don't fight.

00:26:01.142 --> 00:26:05.772
Because a couple breaks
up when they fight each other.

00:26:07.315 --> 00:26:11.653
We're not leaving Mia,

00:26:11.736 --> 00:26:15.865
because she's family.

00:26:21.621 --> 00:26:23.123
Okay, Matmat.

00:26:23.206 --> 00:26:25.208
Whatever happens,

00:26:26.209 --> 00:26:28.211
we're not leaving Mia.

00:26:30.922 --> 00:26:32.465
Mm?

00:26:32.549 --> 00:26:35.093
No, we're not leaving her.

00:26:35.176 --> 00:26:38.054
We'll stick together.

00:26:45.186 --> 00:26:46.146
Among all my books,

00:26:46.229 --> 00:26:47.981
I really want
to publish this one the most.

00:26:48.064 --> 00:26:49.899
Because it's inspired by the three of us.

00:26:49.983 --> 00:26:50.942
Let's not run.

00:26:51.026 --> 00:26:52.652
Are you ready to tell us what you saw?

00:26:52.736 --> 00:26:55.030
A butterfly pinned on her dress!

00:26:55.113 --> 00:26:57.282
She's here, inside the hospital.

00:26:57.365 --> 00:27:02.037
We're not leaving Mia,
because she's family.

00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:04.873
Whatever happens, we're not leaving Mia.

00:27:04.956 --> 00:27:06.875
I'm not going to live in fear anymore.

00:27:06.958 --> 00:27:09.210
Only you can tell me the truth.

00:27:09.294 --> 00:27:11.004
Is your wife still alive?

00:27:11.087 --> 00:27:13.089
Is Ma'am Ingrid in this hospital?

00:27:13.173 --> 00:27:14.758
You're scared of your father?

00:27:15.717 --> 00:27:18.720
I don't want her to die.
I don't want her to turn into a monster.

00:27:18.803 --> 00:27:20.805
A monster like her mother!

00:27:20.889 --> 00:27:24.601
Only two people can be
Ingrid Hernandez at the hospital.

00:27:24.684 --> 00:27:27.437
Olivia and Eden are
surely hiding something from me.

00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:28.521
What are you doing?

00:27:28.605 --> 00:27:31.691
You shouldn't do things
your senior didn't order you to do.

00:27:31.775 --> 00:27:34.235
- You should stay out of it.
- What if she comes back for you?

00:27:34.319 --> 00:27:36.154
Mister Samuel has gone missing!

00:27:36.237 --> 00:27:38.281
Do Ma'am Eden and
Ma'am Olivia know about this?

00:27:38.365 --> 00:27:40.241
I can't contact them.
Why are you looking for them?

00:27:40.325 --> 00:27:42.077
Matmat made that painting.

00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:45.330
The butterfly has found Matmat.

00:27:45.413 --> 00:27:48.375
- It will kill us, Patpat!
- No, no, no.
