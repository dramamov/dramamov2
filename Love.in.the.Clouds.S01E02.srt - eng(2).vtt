{\an8}ADAPTED FROM BAI LU CHENG SHUANG'S
LOVE IN THE CLOUDS

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.120
I wouldn't have taken in a jinx like you,

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.360
if you hadn't insisted on
joining Moonlit Blossoms.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:37.800
You're a jinx!

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.440
You made Immortal He drunk two days ago

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.040
and he passed out for three days.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.000
Yesterday, you gave
Immortal Zhang a massage

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.920
and gave him a fracture!

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.200
Today,

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.160
I asked you to praise Immortal Li

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.960
and you said he had
the biggest head in the Six Realms!

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.080
You're quite something!

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.160
I have a headache now because of you!

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.040
Tell me.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.120
Can you do a better job?

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.360
I can.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.320
Leave if you can't!

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.400
EPISODE 2

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:13.720
Your Lordship, she's not inside.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.880
SHEDDING THE OLD AND EMBRACING THE NEW

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:27.960
- Wait for me here.
- Yes.

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.400
You're back, My Lord. Are you hungry?

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.240
I made scallion pancakes.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.360
It's nice.

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.600
The owner of
Moonlit Blossoms, Fuyue, told me

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.440
I must be hardworking and virtuous

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.720
to capture the heart of a man.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.120
So, I figured

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.480
I would find a kitchen
to make you breakfast.

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:14.640
Scallion pancakes?

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.600
Were you making this?

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.280
Scallion pancakes
are my favorite food in this world.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.040
I'm not sure if you'll like it.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.160
Why didn't you come to find me?

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.520
You are worried about my safety

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:41.880
and don't allow me to leave.

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:43.880
So, I must do something for you, at least.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.600
My Lord, do you

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.200
miss me?

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:33.320
Of course, I miss you.

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.880
What are you doing, My Lord?

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.320
You just woke up.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.200
I feel like

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.200
doing some stretching.

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.960
My Lord, are you trying to…

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.680
It's not right.

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:24.360
You seem like…

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:35.320
Did you bite me?

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.000
It's not an auspicious day.

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.240
Doing this will affect your cultivation.

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.880
You have the spiritual root
so you must take care of your body.

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.680
You said your feelings for me were sincere

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.280
but you are actually a spoilsport.

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:54.560
In that case,

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:56.280
you may return.

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.200
Boring fairies like
you are not welcome here.

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:02.680
- My Lord.
- Granny Xun.

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:05.560
My Lord.

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.840
- My Lordship.
- Send her back to Moonlit Blossoms.

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:10.880
- Yes.
- My Lord, I was wrong.

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.000
Please don't send me
back to Moonlit Blossoms.

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:13.960
If I go back,

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.960
the owner of
Moonlit Blossoms will think I'm useless

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.440
and torture me to death.

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:18.920
My lunch…

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:19.840
That's none of my business.

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:20.760
My Lord.

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.960
My Lord. I was born in a poor family.

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:28.440
My parents have passed away.

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:32.000
I spent my days in
Moonlit Blossoms suffering.

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.120
I only beg you to give me a place to stay.

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:36.840
I'm begging you.

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:43.760
Are you done?

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:47.720
Your story is also ordinary.

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:48.640
That makes you even more boring.

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:52.040
My Lord! My Lord!

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:53.960
You are saving a life
by letting me stay here!

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:56.640
- Why do you have so many things to say?
- I'll do anything and everything

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:57.720
to repay you.

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.440
You must believe me, My Lord!

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.680
- Just leave.
- I'm useful to you, My Lord.

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:03.840
My Lord, I'm willing to
do everything you tell me!

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.240
My Lord, let me stay!

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:25.600
Granny Xun.

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:28.560
Lord Ji misunderstood.

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:31.200
I… I wanted to do it

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:32.720
but I wasn't ready.

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:34.560
Is Lord Ji that impatient
and wants to send me back?

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:36.680
Is he that heartless?
If he sends me back to Moonlit Blossoms,

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:38.000
I'll be in trouble, Granny Xun!

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:39.320
I beg you, Granny Xun.
Please persuade him.

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:40.080
If he's sick of me,
I can stay as a servant.

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:42.520
- I'll be your servant, Granny Xun.
- Can you be quiet for a while?

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:52.400
Fine.

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:55.040
Just send me back.

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:56.480
With no one by Lord Ji's side,

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:59.760
I'm sure someone will arrange
another fairy to serve him.

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:02.200
Granny Xun, you must
screen everyone thoroughly.

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:05.200
I really care about Lord Ji.

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:06.120
You…

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:13.160
Twenty-Seven, I'm relying on you.

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:20.240
Tell Mu Qibai's men

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:22.160
that Ji Bozai has sent
me back to Moonlit Blossoms.

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:29.560
JIXING ABYSS, HUANSHA MARKET

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:33.080
Wait for me!

00:08:33.159 --> 00:08:34.600
- Slow down.
- Hurry!

00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:39.840
- Let's go!
- Drink up.

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:41.600
All of you are so early. I'm late.

00:08:41.679 --> 00:08:42.600
It's my fault.

00:08:42.679 --> 00:08:44.960
I went to Moonlit Blossoms
to see what was going on.

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:46.160
I'm sure you don't know this.

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:49.880
Immortal Ji Bozai brought a fairy back

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:52.840
from Moonlit Blossoms last night.
Do you remember her?

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:54.360
- Of course.
- Talk.

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:56.080
For some reason,

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.800
she offended this upstart of Jixing Abyss.

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:01.440
She was sent back this morning.

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:02.480
She was sent back?

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:05.880
Immortal Ji is already bored with her
after one day.

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:07.800
He sent her back after one day?

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:10.080
Isn't he lacking in energy?

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:12.160
Seriously?

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:14.160
Ji Bozai sent her back?

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:15.280
Yes.

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:18.480
The owner of Moonlit Blossoms
is asking her to wipe the floor now.

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:20.160
How pitiful.

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:22.600
Wiping every corner of the place

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:24.560
back and forth without stopping.

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:28.440
Seriously, why is the owner
of Moonlit Blossoms so cruel?

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:33.040
- Did that really happen?
- Yes.

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:37.240
Since the fairy has been
sent back to Moonlit Blossoms,

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:39.840
now is a good time
for us to send someone to him again.

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:41.640
After the Qingyun Tournament,

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:43.960
I tried to curry favor
with Ji Bozai a few times

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:45.440
but he never replied to me.

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:47.880
I want to see

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:50.800
if he has another excuse to refuse again.

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:55.040
If we can send someone into Wugui Sea,

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:57.440
the alliance

00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:00.160
between Ji Bozai and
my niece won't look as strong

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:01.840
to outsiders.

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:04.880
I understand.

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:16.760
My Lordship.

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:17.920
BUXIU, JI BOZAI'S COMPANION BEAST

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.840
Ming Yi has been sent back.

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:22.040
She is being punished by Fuyue now.

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:24.560
Regarding the destruction of the barrier…

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:25.560
Sending her back is good enough.

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:28.920
There are spies all over Wugui Sea.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.160
She is not the only one who is suspicious.

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:32.960
It was a good excuse to send her away.

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:35.600
The most important thing right now

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:37.840
is to obtain the Moonshade Grass.

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:40.160
Zhushui Spiritual State
won the Qingyun Tournament.

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:42.640
Mangfu Swamp lost

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:44.680
and the grass can be
found among their tributes.

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:47.640
- You may head there tomorrow.
- Yes.

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:51.920
Buxiu,

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:54.040
Zhushui Spiritual State's
techniques are sinister.

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:55.680
Remember to protect yourself.

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:56.680
It's fine.

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:58.760
I'll kill every single one of them.

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:01.120
- If they come in pairs, I…
- Your Lordship.

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:02.440
Two women are here.

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:03.840
They were brought
here by Immortal Yan Xiao.

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:08.160
- Let me handle them.
- Keep them alive first.

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:17.680
- Immortal Ji.
- Immortal Ji.

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:23.000
I was ordered by Lord Hanfeng

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:25.120
to send two more fairies to your place.

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:28.600
You have a huge place
yet you have no servants.

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:30.200
That's not right.

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:31.760
Who told you I have
no one to accompany me?

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:33.960
Didn't I bring one back last night?

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:36.000
But I heard you sent

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:38.000
the fairy back to Moonlit Blossoms.

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:42.960
Since the fairy failed
to serve you well last night,

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:44.240
you were right to send her back.

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:46.920
However, these two fairies

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.360
were specifically
chosen by Lord Hanfeng for you.

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:51.040
Ji, you are an esteemed warrior.

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:53.840
- You should have…
- Yan, are you sure

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:54.840
you heard Ming Yi has
returned to Moonlit Blossoms?

00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:57.800
Yes.

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:00.880
I'll be honest with you.

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:03.960
Ming Yi had a spat with me this morning
and ran away.

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:05.520
I wanted to pretend
as if nothing had happened

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.480
and not be in a mess like a child

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.480
because of a mere fairy.

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:11.840
However, I actually
caused such a misunderstanding.

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:13.080
I'm embarrassed.

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:16.760
However,

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:19.120
I feel upset because I care about her.

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:21.480
I'm in a hurry to find her now.

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:22.720
Excuse me.

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:31.560
MADAM MENG'S BEDCHAMBER,
YAOGUANG MOUNTAIN

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:32.480
Xin.

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:37.400
I made this chestnut cake for you.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.040
Try it.

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:40.880
Is it delicious?

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:42.400
MING XIN,
LORD CHENGYUN OF YAOGUANG MOUNTAIN

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:43.320
Not bad.

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:45.920
{\an8}Ming Xian lost the competition

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.800
{\an8}and fled Yaoguang Mountain,

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:52.560
His Majesty will no
longer tolerate the Empress.

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:53.800
Xin.

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:56.080
As your mother,

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:58.520
I can finally help you clear a path.

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:02.760
I've sent some people
to search the Six Realms

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:03.680
with a Search Mirror.

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:06.040
Once they find Ming Xian's whereabouts,

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:09.760
they will kill him immediately.

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:12.600
If Ming Xian dies out there,

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:14.280
there will be no one to lead the others.

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:18.400
Then, Father will surely

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:21.920
elect another crown prince
before the next Qingyun Tournament.

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:37.480
Be more thorough and work faster.

00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:38.400
FUYUE, OWNER OF MOONLIT BLOSSOMS

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:42.640
Your spiritual power is so weak.

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:45.840
People got it done in a flash
and you've been doing it for so long.

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:47.960
You even had
the audacity to offend Immortal Ji.

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:50.560
Moonlit Blossoms' reputation
was almost ruined because of you.

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:54.320
I'm not sure why I had to be soft-hearted

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:56.120
and bring in someone as useless as you.

00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:57.600
I…

00:13:57.680 --> 00:13:59.280
Because you are soft-hearted.

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:00.560
You are the best.

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:03.240
Where is Young Master He? Has he left?

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:04.760
Don't mention him.

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:06.840
We should stop wiping the floor.

00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:09.960
He has uneven legs
and slipped a few times.

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:11.360
He is very unhappy.

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:14.120
I had to sing a few more
songs for him because of that.

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:16.800
Don't you feel bad for me?

00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:19.160
Of course, I do.

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:21.000
Why would you ask
them to scrub the floor then?

00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:23.960
That's enough. Stop scrubbing.

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:36.360
Twenty-Seven.

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:38.960
Have you caught any fish?

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:42.360
Let me tell you.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.120
Ming Xian was defeated by
a warrior from Jixing Abyss.

00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:48.640
He couldn't have fled to
this place no matter what.

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:50.560
I think Lord Chengyun must be so anxious

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:52.880
that he sent both of us to find him here.

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:54.440
Whether we find him or not,

00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:56.280
we should still obey
our orders and come here.

00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:58.880
However, we must ask for compensation

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:01.280
for our hard work.

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:04.000
Jixing Abyss' Moonlit Blossoms

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:05.200
is true to its reputation.

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:07.280
Come and relax over here.

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:11.000
That person gave me this Search Mirror.

00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:13.040
If Ming Xian appears around here,

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:14.800
it will alert us.

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:16.200
Once it is activated,

00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:18.280
a compass will appear on the mirror.

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:20.400
There's a reaction?

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:22.760
Is Ming Xian really hiding here?

00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:23.960
After her!

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:26.640
- Stop!
- Stop!

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:28.920
Move!

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:29.840
Move!

00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:37.600
Make way.

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:41.080
That's…

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:43.240
The compass keeps spinning.

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:44.800
Why can't we see her?

00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:46.640
Sorry.

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:50.080
That's…

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:52.360
- Make way.
- My bad.

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:53.800
- She's upstairs.
- Let me pass.

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:57.280
Where is she?

00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:00.040
Who is it?

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:01.760
It's her!

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:02.840
Stop running!

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:04.200
What are they doing?

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:06.280
They actually found me.

00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:09.400
Freeze!

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:13.480
Trying to escape? Turn around.

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:17.360
Why isn't Ji Bozai here yet?

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:19.840
If everything else fails,
I'll have to do it myself.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:26.960
This…

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:30.240
She's mine.

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:33.080
Why are you chasing after her?

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:36.000
Immortal Ji,
are you going to interfere with everything

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:37.480
after you rose to power?

00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:39.160
- This fairy is suspicious.
- Don't be afraid.

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:41.040
It triggers our Search Mirror.

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:42.400
Please step away.

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:49.040
You lot from Yaoguang Mountain.

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:52.160
You lost in the Qingyun Tournament
and have dropped to the Lower Realms.

00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:54.560
Now, you're trying to use a silly mirror

00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:56.440
to capture someone at Jixing Abyss?

00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:57.360
You should leave now.

00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:58.440
Immortal Ji.

00:16:58.520 --> 00:16:59.960
We are only obeying orders.

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:01.360
This fairy was behaving strangely.

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:02.280
She ran as soon as she saw us.

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:04.319
- We have to…
- Do you not understand me?

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:05.839
I said

00:17:06.839 --> 00:17:07.800
leave.

00:17:09.079 --> 00:17:10.640
She is a fairy of Moonlit Blossoms.

00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:11.880
It's impossible for her to be Ming Xian.

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:13.760
I'm sure something's
wrong with Lord Chengyun's item.

00:17:13.839 --> 00:17:15.000
We should leave immediately.

00:17:15.079 --> 00:17:16.720
- Let's not offend Ji Bozai.
- Sure.

00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:19.480
They left.

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:23.079
Why are you running away?

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:26.400
Quick. Get changed
and come back to Wugui Sea with me.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.720
Granny Xun, you are firm.

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:42.440
You are rejecting Lord Hanfeng's goodwill.

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:46.080
However, what good will it be

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:48.880
if you offend Lord Hanfeng for real?

00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:57.440
Granny Xun, you stayed here willingly

00:17:57.520 --> 00:17:58.520
because Ji saved your life.

00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:01.160
You should consider it for his sake.

00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:03.560
Since you know my background so well,

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:05.840
I'm sure you also know

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:08.800
that everyone in Wugui Sea
only obeys His Lordship.

00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:16.760
All of you, please leave.

00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:18.600
Your Lordship.

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:24.160
How long has it been?

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:28.280
You're already finding
someone else to replace me?

00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:31.560
Calm down.

00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:40.400
Yan,

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:42.440
help me clear this misunderstanding.

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:50.360
Fairy Ming Yi,

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:53.920
Lord Hanfeng
specifically chose these two fairies.

00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:55.800
They will never steal your spotlight.

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:01.360
My Lord.

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:06.240
When you brought me
back from Moonlit Blossoms,

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:08.360
didn't you promise me
to treat each other sincerely

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:11.440
so I can stay at Wugui Sea in peace?

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:13.080
I guess.

00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:15.800
In that case,

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:20.000
how am I not
the lady-in-command of Wugui Sea?

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:30.520
Let's do it your way for now.

00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:34.120
For now?

00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:35.600
Does it count?

00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:39.600
Yes.

00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:42.680
All right. You said so.

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:45.720
If both of you insist
on staying at Wugui Sea,

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:48.240
I'd destroy my own primordial spirit.

00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:49.160
You must not.

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:00.880
Ask them to leave then.

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:02.440
Meanwhile, you should also tell everyone

00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:04.320
that I am the lady in charge here
so they can give up.

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:05.400
Stop sending anyone here.

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:06.680
Otherwise, I'll kill myself!

00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:15.760
Yan.

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:18.120
See?

00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:19.960
What should I do?

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:23.880
My house is a mess
because of your goodwill.

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:27.040
I'm sure you don't want to see me
become a widower.

00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:29.160
Right?

00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:41.080
A widower, you say?

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:43.360
Since you've made your message clear,

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:45.120
what else can I do?

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:46.800
Please leave.

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:51.320
Carry on. I'm leaving.

00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:19.040
Why are you staring at me, My Lord?

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:32.240
It turns out I accidentally brought back

00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:39.960
the lady in charge of Wugui Sea.

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:44.600
You're welcome.

00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:55.520
My Lord.

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:02.760
Who exactly are you?

00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:05.560
You only went back to
Moonlit Blossoms for an hour

00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:08.560
before Yan Xiao brought his men here.

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:10.000
What does it have to do with me?

00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:15.840
Are you suspecting me
of spreading the news?

00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:20.120
Even Yaoguang Mountain's stupid mirror

00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:22.360
reacted to you.

00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:24.520
Who exactly are you?

00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:25.480
My Lord, let go of me.

00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:26.800
It hurts.

00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:42.320
Are you trying to verify

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:45.000
if I had used the Transfiguration Spell?

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:46.880
Sure.

00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:48.920
Go ahead.

00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:16.640
Do you still think I'm not innocent?

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:20.560
How do I know
why the stupid mirror is related to me?

00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:23.320
You gave away the tributes
from Yaoguang Mountain recently

00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:26.840
to the other fairies.

00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:28.680
Perhaps those were the things

00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:30.200
that the Search Mirror reacted to.

00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:33.160
It's too much of a coincidence.

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:37.280
Did you find anything
by verifying my body?

00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:42.640
No.

00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:46.440
You searched and interrogated me.

00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:50.520
You did so much without getting anything.

00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:52.560
I feel sorry for you.

00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:56.960
Not really.

00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:03.000
When I was asking you questions just now,

00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:05.440
your breathing was a mess.

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:22.160
You are the one

00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:26.600
who's in a mess.

00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:48.040
My Lord, if you don't believe me,

00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:49.640
I'll leave.

00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:28.280
Tell me.

00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:30.960
Where do these things come from?

00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:38.160
Spare me, My Lord.

00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:40.040
Why are you stealing?

00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:43.520
Because

00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:45.400
I am broke.

00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:57.240
My family has been
living in Freezing Hot Waters.

00:25:57.320 --> 00:25:58.760
They can only make
a living by gathering herbs.

00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:00.560
All my relatives and friends

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:01.840
are struggling to put food on the table.

00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:04.000
- So, I…
- You still shouldn't do this.

00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:06.960
Yes! I am ashamed.

00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:08.040
Please punish me severely.

00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:11.000
No, not a severe punishment.

00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:12.880
I'm willing to fast for three meals.

00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:15.080
I'll do all of Granny Xun's chores.

00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:17.080
If you need me, I can still…

00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:18.680
If you need anything, just tell me.

00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:22.240
I told Yan Xiao

00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:25.000
that you are the lady of Wugui Sea.

00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:26.440
If you need anything in the future,

00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:27.920
just ask.

00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:30.400
Also,

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:34.280
this room is yours from now on.

00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:36.360
This room…

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:37.880
That's…

00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:42.280
Thank you, My Lord!

00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:44.560
Thank you, My Lord!

00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:55.200
I…

00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:05.200
Ji Bozai is very cautious.

00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:06.760
We must be well-prepared.

00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:08.320
Where's the thing I asked you to prepare?

00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:20.000
If I pretend to be greedy,

00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:22.120
I can get rid of his suspicion instead.

00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:23.760
As long as I can get the antidote,

00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:25.800
I don't mind letting
you get your way for a few days.

00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:32.800
My Lordship.

00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:34.480
I've told you many times

00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:36.960
- not to bow when you meet me in private.
- Yes.

00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:42.760
Before you head to
Zhushui Spiritual State,

00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:45.040
- go to Freezing Hot Waters.
- Why?

00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:47.360
Ming Yi was born there.

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:49.200
Check her background thoroughly.

00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:51.880
Your Lordship,
are you going to let her stay?

00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:55.920
I'm letting her stay temporarily.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:57.760
She used me to acknowledge her position

00:27:57.840 --> 00:27:59.880
in front of Yan Xiao.

00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:02.160
I couldn't send her away so soon.

00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:06.360
People outside are also trying
to plant their men here.

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:07.960
If there's nothing wrong with her,

00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:11.200
I can just use her as cover to stop them.

00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:12.880
You are too cautious, Your Lordship.

00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:15.520
Actually, killing her is easier.

00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:24.880
If she's indeed a child
born in a herb-gathering family

00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:26.800
from Freezing Hot Waters,

00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:29.400
she is still useful

00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:32.600
to my plan.

00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:40.960
Did Lord Hanfeng summon you as well?

00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:43.120
No. I'm just here to play.

00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:49.160
Here you go.

00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:50.080
Thank you.

00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:56.080
It's nice.

00:28:57.560 --> 00:28:58.800
Forgive me.

00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:01.600
Ji Bozai brought back
the fairy from Moonlit Blossoms

00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:04.000
and used her as a shield
to refuse any newcomers.

00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:07.040
If the easy way doesn't work,

00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:08.240
let's do it the hard way.

00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:10.800
Hard ones are bad.

00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:12.120
They hurt the teeth.

00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:19.200
Lord Hanfeng, do you want me to frame her?

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:21.520
But we have nothing to hold over her.

00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:24.080
This pot is hard to
hold even with a handle.

00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:29.040
I should go and feel out

00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:31.800
what kind of place the Wugui Sea is.

00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:32.720
You are right, Lord Hanfeng.

00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:40.320
Outsiders can't see or hear us now.

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:41.600
You are quite something.

00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:43.560
After what you did,

00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:45.560
you successfully reassured Ji Bozai

00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:47.080
and even convinced him to let you stay.

00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:50.160
Jixing Abyss' current situation

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:53.360
is the emperor has fallen sick

00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:55.200
and he is often in a deep slumber.

00:29:56.760 --> 00:29:59.480
He only has one daughter

00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:01.160
who can't inherit the throne.

00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:04.600
His younger brother,
Mu Qibai, Lord Hanfeng,

00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:07.840
will most probably be the next emperor.

00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:09.920
However, no one expected

00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:11.800
Princess Tianji

00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:14.760
to find Ji Bozai
who was in the Sunken Abyss

00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:18.120
and helped Jixing Abyss
rise to the Upper Realms.

00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:20.640
I was right indeed.

00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:23.920
After the end of Qingyun Tournament,

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.200
Princess Tianji

00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:27.080
was also willing to marry
Ji Bozai in a marriage alliance.

00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:32.920
Lord Hanfeng won't be pleased
to see things turning out that way.

00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:34.800
So,

00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:37.920
he is trying to win
over Ji Bozai on the surface

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:38.880
but in truth,

00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:42.320
he is wary of Ji Bozai's
marriage alliance with Princess Tianji.

00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:48.840
So, Ji Bozai needs a shield

00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:51.200
just like how I need a scratching board.

00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:56.960
So, Wugui Sea is not a place

00:30:57.040 --> 00:31:00.320
where Ji Bozai can hide
the Golden Millet Dream without worries.

00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:03.240
Have you searched his body?

00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:04.880
Me?

00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:06.880
Why?

00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:09.680
Think about it.

00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:14.400
He might be carrying
the most precious thing on him.

00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:17.760
It won't be so obvious.

00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:27.080
You are the one

00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:31.960
who's in a mess.

00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:37.640
Don't tell me that it's really on him?

00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:40.040
Can you search his body though?

00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:44.520
I might not be able to do that

00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:49.960
but I can achieve the same effect.

00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:02.680
You are sullying my ears.

00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:04.120
What are you talking about?

00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:05.400
Don't you know that I'm still young?

00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:09.600
Turn it back.

00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:13.520
I'll give you a dried fish later.

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:33.600
Look at you. You're collecting junk.

00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:41.000
Found it.

00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:44.480
Why are you bringing
leisure books for your escape?

00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:46.760
I spent a lot of effort to find them

00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:48.600
after I found out he had
been treating Moonlit Blossoms

00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:50.120
as his home.

00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:53.400
I, your master, learn things quickly.

00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:54.560
Things like these are…

00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:55.480
What…

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.160
What are these?

00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:09.920
DUAL CULTIVATION MANUAL

00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:13.880
It sullies my eyes!

00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:20.400
I see Moonlit Blossoms as my second home.

00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:22.600
I did

00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:26.040
make many promises here

00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:28.640
and left many memories.

00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:31.760
I thank all of you for your love

00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:34.520
because I can leave
the mundane world behind

00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:36.760
and attain ultimate joy.

00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:41.680
Here's a humble gift.

00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:46.720
I hope everything goes well
for all of you in the future.

00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:06.800
You will soon get

00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:08.880
what I promised you.

00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:12.360
You won't renege
on what you promised earlier, right?

00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:14.000
Don't worry, Immortal Ji.

00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:16.360
You saved my life.

00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:17.719
I will surely repay you.

00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:19.400
I won't go back on my promise.

00:34:20.199 --> 00:34:21.199
You owe me nothing.

00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:25.239
The person must be killed
regardless of your existence.

00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:26.480
He might be my father,

00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:30.000
but he treated me and my mother cruelly.

00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:31.760
RUO SHUI, A SERVANT OF MOONLIT BLOSSOMS

00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:33.159
I won't forgive him.

00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:35.719
I will do according to your plan

00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:37.880
and definitely

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.480
make him pay the price.

00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:43.159
Of course.

00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:45.960
Those who committed crimes

00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:49.120
should not end well.

00:34:52.639 --> 00:34:56.159
DUAL CULTIVATION MANUAL

00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:01.920
I'm well-versed in
the Dual Cultivation Manual.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.360
I am not the person I was yesterday.

00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:05.560
Tonight, I will find out
everything about Ji Bozai

00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:07.360
and bring back
the Golden Millet Dream on him.

00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:08.320
Just wait.

00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:15.880
Help me get an outfit.

00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:18.400
What kind of outfit?

00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:22.720
It sullies my ear!

00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:24.440
Hurry!

00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:26.080
Hurry!

00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:31.480
You are using my weakness against me.

00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:33.040
Don't you think that's too much?

00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:37.840
- Not at all.
- Who is the most obedient kitty?

00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:39.880
I am.

00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:18.400
His room is so well-ventilated.

00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:20.160
It's really cold

00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:21.760
and doesn't contain any warmth.

00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:32.960
This Ji Bozai is a non-issue.

00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:43.600
This is too ordinary.

00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:52.960
Too dull.

00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:55.520
All right.

00:36:57.640 --> 00:36:58.720
You're back?

00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:02.160
Will this work?

00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:24.400
Your Lordship.

00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:27.920
Lord Hanfeng has been
waiting inside for a long time.

00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:55.920
Embers?

00:37:56.840 --> 00:37:59.280
Embers.

00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:01.200
Without you,

00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:03.720
I would've died in
Ji Bozai's hands back then.

00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:27.400
It fell into his Spirit Well back then.

00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:30.600
Is he treating it as a trophy

00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:32.000
to be viewed every day?

00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:33.960
- Bozai.
- Ji Bozai.

00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:36.200
Outsiders seldom come to Wugui Sea.

00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:38.440
I hope I'm not interrupting anything
with my sudden visit today.

00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:39.400
Not at all.

00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:40.680
My place is empty

00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:42.840
and it must look silly to you.

00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:52.280
Bozai,

00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:53.800
is this where you usually live?

00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:55.760
This is…

00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:00.640
Lord Hanfeng, please come inside.

00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:02.320
Bozai,

00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:04.360
your residence

00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:05.280
LET THE MIND SOAR TO GREAT HEIGHTS

00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:06.280
is bright and well-ventilated.

00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:09.520
Yes.

00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:14.200
The abyss in the past
was cramped and suffocating.

00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:19.320
A place that's too dark
hides a lot of filth.

00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:21.680
Right now,

00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:24.200
I like how spacious it is.

00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:27.600
You are really different indeed.

00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:31.320
However, your Wugui Sea
only has an old servant.

00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:33.480
It feels empty after all.

00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:36.000
Why don't I arrange
two more servants for you

00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:37.600
so you have more people here.

00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:39.360
Lord Hanfeng, please don't do that.

00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:41.600
I'm afraid that fairy of mine

00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:43.400
will cause trouble again.

00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:45.800
How did you find someone so possessive?

00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:57.600
Granny Xun, bring the wine.

00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:05.600
This wine

00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:08.680
was brewed under Meng Yangqiu's guidance.

00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:12.520
A recipe from the wine immortal's family.

00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:13.440
Try it, quick.

00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:24.640
It's fine wine.

00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:27.920
I'll be honest.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.280
I've always wanted to be friends with you.

00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:34.840
My niece, Tianji, knew you before me.

00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:37.000
She has a good eye for talent

00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:38.760
and promoted you to be a warrior.

00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:44.040
You competed and made Jixing Abyss proud.

00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:47.240
I came to know you later,

00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:50.520
but my admiration for you

00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:53.760
surpasses everyone else's.

00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:58.600
I am honored

00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:01.640
to be appreciated by you, Lord Hanfeng.

00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:16.240
Since you've agreed to be my friend,

00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:18.600
can you

00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:21.480
enlighten me on something?

00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:23.240
I'll tell you everything I know.

00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:29.040
There has been a rumor in Jixing Palace

00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:30.880
saying that your spiritual veins

00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:32.360
were obtained through Heavenly Grief.

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:36.960
You used Heavenly Grief
yet you still survive.

00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:39.040
Do you actually possess

00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:42.960
the Golden Millet Dream?
