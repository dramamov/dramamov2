[Ed, on tape recorder]
<i>My name is Ed Warren,</i>

00:20.020 --> 00:23.607
<i>here with my wife, Lorraine,</i>
<i>and Victoria Grainger.</i>

00:24.483 --> 00:26.777
<i>It's April 20th, 1964.</i>

00:28.112 --> 00:33.325
<i>Victoria… when did you first notice</i>
<i>these supernatural occurrences?</i>

00:36.120 --> 00:37.663
[Victoria] <i>I'm sorry,</i>
<i>I don't know how to do this.</i>

00:38.539 --> 00:40.666
[Ed] <i>Why don't you just</i>
<i>take us back to the beginning?</i>

[Victoria] <i>My father thought</i>
<i>something was following him.</i>

00:48.257 --> 00:49.884
<i>Something he couldn't see.</i>

00:51.802 --> 00:54.096
He'd lock the doors at night,
and the next morning, they…

00:54.180 --> 00:55.306
[pattering fades]

00:55.389 --> 00:56.682
…they'd be open.

01:01.020 --> 01:02.396
[shuddering breath]

01:02.772 --> 01:05.274
Then he started hearing… [inhales]

01:06.317 --> 01:07.318
…voices.

01:08.402 --> 01:09.695
I didn't believe him.

01:11.530 --> 01:13.199
I thought he was getting old, you know?

01:17.328 --> 01:18.871
But then I came in one day, and…

01:20.247 --> 01:22.750
[shuddering breaths]

01:23.083 --> 01:24.210
I found him.

01:32.218 --> 01:34.261
It was so quiet here after he was gone.

01:37.556 --> 01:40.059
But then something changed.
[deep breath]

01:41.811 --> 01:43.103
I could feel it.

01:44.980 --> 01:46.941
<i>This really strong feeling, like…</i>

01:47.024 --> 01:48.901
[panting]

01:48.984 --> 01:50.569
<i>…like I'm being watched.</i>

01:51.904 --> 01:53.906
[faint growl]

02:03.332 --> 02:04.792
There's something in there.

02:06.877 --> 02:08.254
And when I'm here alone…

02:09.880 --> 02:11.382
and it's very quiet…

02:13.467 --> 02:15.010
…it calls to me.

the outlet blew out!

14:12.477 --> 14:13.812
Mom, just give me a minute.

14:13.895 --> 14:16.898
Honey, there's still time
to fix your hair, right?

14:16.982 --> 14:18.733
And you look so beautiful in this dress!

14:18.817 --> 14:20.277
Yeah, let's not lie to her, Grandma.

14:20.360 --> 14:21.736
[shrieks] I'm gonna kill you!

14:21.820 --> 14:23.738
You can't kill her on your confirmation.

14:26.157 --> 14:28.159
[organ playing gently]

14:28.493 --> 14:30.036
Milo Evans Roberts.

14:30.912 --> 14:32.789
Milo Evans Roberts,

14:32.872 --> 14:35.292
be sealed with the gift
of the Holy Spirit.

14:35.375 --> 14:36.710
- [Milo] Amen.
- I don't know.

14:37.502 --> 14:39.296
- Honey, you're in the shot.
- Here she comes.

14:39.379 --> 14:41.506
[dad] <i>Get out of the way.</i>
<i>Sorry, thank you.</i>

14:41.590 --> 14:43.550
[camcorder whirring]

14:43.633 --> 14:45.385
[dad] <i>Oh, doesn't she look beautiful?</i>

14:45.468 --> 14:47.387
[bishop] …Holy Spirit.
Peace be with you.

14:50.724 --> 14:53.310
Heather Elizabeth Smurl.

14:53.393 --> 14:54.894
Heather Elizabeth Smurl,

14:55.437 --> 14:57.564
be sealed with the gift
of the Holy Spirit.

14:58.189 --> 14:59.149
Amen.

14:59.232 --> 15:00.108
Peace be with you.

15:00.191 --> 15:01.860
[camcorder whirring]

15:02.902 --> 15:03.903
[dad] <i>There she is.</i>

15:06.406 --> 15:07.949
<i>She's confirmed.</i>

15:08.033 --> 15:09.659
<i>- You did it, honey.</i>
- [crackle]

15:12.412 --> 15:14.748
- Hey, girls! Who wants dinner?
- We do!

15:14.831 --> 15:17.208
- Come on! Get inside, then!
- I'm super hungry!

15:17.292 --> 15:20.337
Hurry, hurry! Chop, chop, chop!
It's getting cold!

15:20.420 --> 15:23.173
…to call.
Yes, it was a beautiful ceremony.

15:23.965 --> 15:25.967
- John, stop!
- Oh, honey!

15:26.051 --> 15:28.345
You know how much I love your dips!

15:28.845 --> 15:30.388
- Ah! I love it!
- Ugh…

15:33.850 --> 15:35.310
- Hold on…
- Where should I put the salad?

15:35.393 --> 15:36.436
[grandpa] Mm-hmm.

15:37.395 --> 15:38.063
[child giggles]

15:38.146 --> 15:40.106
[Heather] Grandma?
Where do you want the salad?

15:40.398 --> 15:41.608
[screams, laughter]

15:41.691 --> 15:43.526
You two think you're so funny!

15:43.610 --> 15:46.696
Hey, what's all this noise? [laughs]

15:46.780 --> 15:48.865
- Sorry, that was the girls.
- Hey, no running in the house, girls.

15:49.324 --> 15:53.119
[dad] <i>Okay. Round up, round up.</i>
<i>What do we have here?</i>

15:53.203 --> 15:56.122
<i>- It's taller than I am!</i>
- [family chuckling]

15:56.206 --> 15:57.040
<i>Oh, my gosh!</i>

15:57.123 --> 15:59.000
<i>I didn't get anything for my confirmation.</i>

15:59.084 --> 16:01.544
<i>- Dawn…</i>
<i>- I thought we got you that nice brooch?</i>

16:01.628 --> 16:03.338
- [grandpa] <i>Yeah.</i>
<i>- Oh, yeah…</i>

16:03.421 --> 16:04.798
<i>Yeah, there was that.</i>

16:04.881 --> 16:06.549
- [grandpa] <i>Go on, open it.</i>
<i>- Okay.</i>

16:07.926 --> 16:09.928
[dad mimics drum roll]

16:10.929 --> 16:12.222
[family laughing]

16:16.559 --> 16:17.686
- It's a mirror.
- [dog barks]

16:19.396 --> 16:20.980
[barking continues]

16:21.064 --> 16:22.232
It's got a crack.

16:22.315 --> 16:23.775
- [dad] Oh, Heather…
- [grandma] Oh, sweetie,

16:23.858 --> 16:25.819
Grandpa can fix the glass.

16:25.902 --> 16:28.822
We found it at the swap meet,
over in Bucks County.

16:28.905 --> 16:30.240
- [dad] Simon, hush!
- You did?

16:30.323 --> 16:31.449
[barking continues]

16:31.533 --> 16:33.243
- [Simon panting]
- Hey…

16:34.869 --> 16:36.454
- I love it.
- [relieved laughter]

16:36.538 --> 16:37.956
Thanks, Grandpa.

16:38.039 --> 16:40.375
- Oh, honey, you're welcome.
- Thanks, Gran.

16:40.458 --> 16:42.377
Oh, sweetheart!

16:42.961 --> 16:45.547
- Mom, I hope it wasn't too much.
- Oh, don't worry.

16:45.630 --> 16:49.384
The man couldn't get it back in his truck,
so he gave us a little deal.

16:50.051 --> 16:52.220
I think it was just waiting for us.

16:52.303 --> 16:53.763
We know the bathroom gets crowded.

16:53.847 --> 16:55.890
You can put it in your room,
and you don't have to share with anyone.

16:55.974 --> 16:57.058
- That's a good idea.
- [Dawn] That is not going

16:57.142 --> 16:58.226
- in our bedroom.
- [mom] Well, I…

16:58.309 --> 16:59.686
- [Dawn] Are you serious?
- …think it's lovely…

16:59.769 --> 17:00.937
…and very thoughtful.

17:01.020 --> 17:02.230
- [dad] No more queues.
- [Simon barks]

17:02.313 --> 17:06.025
Doesn't the one up at the top
look just like you when you were a baby?

17:06.109 --> 17:07.777
[laughs] Oh, yeah, definitely.

17:07.861 --> 17:08.987
- I can see that.
- [bang]

17:09.070 --> 17:10.113
Ow!

17:10.613 --> 17:11.990
- [mom] Heather!
- My foot slipped.

17:12.073 --> 17:13.533
[mom] It did not. I saw that.

17:13.616 --> 17:15.160
- Okay, seriously, though.
- Dawn's foot got in the way.

17:15.243 --> 17:16.661
Not now. Right…

17:16.745 --> 17:18.204
That resemblance is crazy.

17:18.830 --> 17:20.707
- You've got the bangs and everything.
- Who wants cake?

17:20.790 --> 17:22.792
- [girls] I do! I do! I do!
- [barking continues]

17:25.670 --> 17:27.839
- [mom] Okay!
- [dad ooh-ing]

17:27.922 --> 17:30.258
- [mom] Come on. There we go!
- [dad] There we go!

17:30.759 --> 17:32.260
[Dawn] It looks so good.

17:32.343 --> 17:33.845
[dad mimics fanfare]

17:33.928 --> 17:35.930
[dad] Confirmation cake!

17:36.806 --> 17:39.559
- [mom] <i>Congratulations, sweetheart.</i>
<i>- Thank you.</i>

17:39.642 --> 17:40.894
I definitely didn't get a cake.

17:40.977 --> 17:42.228
- Don't forget to make a wish.
- [barking]

17:42.312 --> 17:43.229
Simon, hush!

17:43.313 --> 17:44.397
[girl] Simon wants some cake, too.

17:44.481 --> 17:45.815
Here we go!

17:45.899 --> 17:46.983
<i>Ready?</i>

17:47.567 --> 17:48.818
[deep inhale]

17:49.861 --> 17:51.321
Hey, what? She blew out my candles.

17:51.404 --> 17:53.156
- Who?
- Dawn!

17:53.239 --> 17:54.991
- No, I didn't!
- You did!

17:55.074 --> 17:56.868
- [Dawn] No, I didn't!
- [grandma] Get some light on.

17:56.951 --> 17:58.703
- [dad] It's all right.
- I actually didn't blow them out.

17:58.787 --> 18:00.413
[dad] It's okay, guys.
Come on, let's have a bit of peace.

18:00.497 --> 18:01.247
She did.

18:01.498 --> 18:02.665
[all screaming]

18:02.749 --> 18:03.666
[Dawn] Oh, my God!

18:03.750 --> 18:05.043
[grandma] Heather! Oh, my God!

18:05.126 --> 18:07.045
[girl] Heather! Are you okay?

18:07.128 --> 18:08.254
[mom] It's okay. What's wrong?

18:08.338 --> 18:11.257
[Dawn] Oh, my God.
Dad? That is a lot of blood.

18:11.341 --> 18:12.425
[dad] Did it hit you?

18:12.509 --> 18:14.636
Oh, my God, are you hurt?

18:14.719 --> 18:16.137
[Dawn] Hey, it's okay, it's okay.
Just squeeze my hand.

18:16.221 --> 18:18.848
- It's okay. It's okay.
- I'll go and get the first aid kit!

18:43.039 --> 18:47.460
[discordant choir vocalizing]

18:54.634 --> 18:56.094
[vocalizing stops]

18:58.763 --> 19:00.098
[bell tolls]

19:00.181 --> 19:03.852
[Ed] The young occupants of the apartment
thought they were speaking to the spirit

19:03.935 --> 19:06.145
of a little girl named Annabelle Mullins.

19:06.229 --> 19:09.607
But in reality, they were communing
with an inhuman spirit.

19:09.899 --> 19:11.067
A demon.

19:11.150 --> 19:13.361
It played on their sympathies.

19:13.444 --> 19:15.446
It played on their compassion.

19:15.989 --> 19:19.826
It then asked for permission
to enter the doll as its vessel,

19:19.909 --> 19:22.036
a conduit into our world.

19:22.120 --> 19:24.455
We've encountered hundreds
of items like Annabelle.

19:25.540 --> 19:28.710
- Cursed objects, totems…
- [projector clicks]

19:28.793 --> 19:32.171
…and over the years, we've found that
the best solution was to collect them.

19:32.255 --> 19:34.215
It's like taking guns off the streets.

19:34.299 --> 19:36.634
- [clicks]
- Hang on, sorry.

19:36.718 --> 19:38.177
[projector whirs, clicks]

19:40.138 --> 19:41.306
You know what?

19:41.389 --> 19:42.807
Will one of you hit the lights?

19:43.933 --> 19:45.101
[groans]

19:46.603 --> 19:47.854
[Ed] All right.

19:48.563 --> 19:50.440
Okay. Uh, any questions?

19:52.025 --> 19:53.026
Yes?

19:53.568 --> 19:56.112
So, you guys were
kind of like <i>The Ghostbusters?</i>

19:56.195 --> 19:59.032
Uh, no. We didn't… bust ghosts.

19:59.115 --> 20:01.159
But we did see the movie. [chuckles]

20:01.451 --> 20:03.661
Wait! So, you never got slimed?

20:03.745 --> 20:05.038
- [laughs]
- Please…

20:05.747 --> 20:07.373
Any serious questions?

20:08.166 --> 20:09.042
Yes?

20:09.125 --> 20:10.460
Why did you stop?

20:11.377 --> 20:12.337
We haven't stopped.

20:12.420 --> 20:14.589
We're travelling, we're doing lectures.

20:14.672 --> 20:16.007
We may even write a book.

20:16.549 --> 20:18.843
But you're not taking cases anymore.

20:18.927 --> 20:21.429
Well, we've decided to, um,

20:21.763 --> 20:23.514
to focus on other parts of our life.

20:23.598 --> 20:24.557
Mm.

20:24.641 --> 20:26.059
[student] Let's get out of here.

20:26.684 --> 20:28.978
- "Who ya gonna call?"
- [scattered laughter]

20:30.355 --> 20:31.564
[door opens]

20:32.190 --> 20:34.525
- Well… thank you.
- [door slams]

20:40.365 --> 20:42.200
[Ed] Our entire life's work…

20:42.283 --> 20:45.536
It's like some sort of
<i>Saturday Night Live </i>skit.

20:45.620 --> 20:47.246
- [Judy snickers]
- Wha-- It's not funny!

20:47.330 --> 20:49.332
Dad, it wasn't that bad!

20:49.415 --> 20:51.042
[Ed sighs]

20:51.125 --> 20:55.088
Hon, I think you're not seeing
the forest for the trees.

20:55.171 --> 20:56.005
[sighs]

20:56.089 --> 20:57.924
Or the ghosts for the graveyard.

20:58.007 --> 20:59.509
Oh, great.

21:00.677 --> 21:02.011
People weren't even listening, though.

21:02.095 --> 21:04.222
[stammers]
They're not even engaged anymore.

21:04.305 --> 21:07.183
It's like they're just all
waiting for a punchline.

21:08.518 --> 21:10.269
They're just having fun.

21:11.229 --> 21:12.313
I guess.

21:13.773 --> 21:15.650
When they asked why you guys quit,

21:15.733 --> 21:17.777
why didn't you just say,
'cause of your heart?

21:19.862 --> 21:22.240
Because that's what an old man would say.

21:23.574 --> 21:26.744
Besides, it-it's more a hiatus
than retirement.

21:27.286 --> 21:29.747
It's… It's just until
the doc clears me again.

21:29.831 --> 21:30.832
Right, hon?

21:34.085 --> 21:37.338
Well, in the meantime,
we have your birthday coming up.

21:37.422 --> 21:39.799
- Mm-hmm. [chuckles]
- And I was thinking

21:39.882 --> 21:41.342
of bringing Tony to the party.

21:41.426 --> 21:42.093
Who's Tony?

21:42.176 --> 21:44.262
Dad! We've been dating for six months.

21:44.345 --> 21:45.722
Oh, that Tony.

21:45.805 --> 21:47.640
[scoffs] You're not funny.

21:47.724 --> 21:50.309
Of course, sweetheart. We love him.

21:51.394 --> 21:52.937
- We do?
- Ed.

21:53.438 --> 21:54.522
- We do.
- [waitress] You guys ready?

21:54.605 --> 21:55.815
- Yeah.
- Yes.

21:55.898 --> 21:58.317
I'll have the linguine with clams, please.

21:58.401 --> 22:00.111
- [waitress] Yeah, great choice.
- Okay.

22:01.195 --> 22:02.030
Who's next?

22:04.240 --> 22:05.742
Uh, yeah, I can do it.

22:05.825 --> 22:06.951
Um…

22:08.119 --> 22:10.621
Boy, you got
a lot of good stuff here. Um…

22:11.122 --> 22:13.416
[fading] I'm on
a bit of a heart healthy diet…

…to thank you for this wonderful party.

35:50.482 --> 35:52.901
All my favorite people are right…

35:54.653 --> 35:55.320

36:14.381 --> 36:17.342
- [exhales]
- Tony, you're acting so nervous!

36:17.426 --> 36:18.677
What? I'm not nervous.

36:20.178 --> 36:23.724
[sighs] I just really
want them to approve.

36:24.516 --> 36:25.517
Of what?

36:26.226 --> 36:29.021
I don't know. Uh, you know, me, us.

36:29.104 --> 36:31.231
[scoffs] You've got nothing
to worry about.

36:32.107 --> 36:33.567
My mom loves you.

36:36.194 --> 36:37.195
What about your dad?

36:41.491 --> 36:42.826
- [laughing] Stop!
- Are you serious?

36:42.910 --> 36:45.287
- You're telling me this now?
- I didn't say that! Come on.

36:46.872 --> 36:48.874
What's with the tie? It's not a funeral.

36:48.957 --> 36:50.417
[Tony] So now I'm not even dressed right.

36:50.500 --> 36:51.835
- [Judy laughs]
- Oh, my God.

36:51.919 --> 36:53.503
[chuckling]

36:53.587 --> 36:55.047
All right. Where are we?

36:55.130 --> 36:56.256
Is she here?

36:56.340 --> 36:58.008
- Oh! Aw…
- Happy birthday, Dad!

36:58.342 --> 36:59.927
- Thank you, sweetie.
- Hey, Mom.

37:00.010 --> 37:02.429
- Tommy?
- Dad, it's Tony!

37:02.512 --> 37:04.264
- That's what I said.
- Happy birthday, Mr. Warren.

37:04.348 --> 37:06.725
- Thank you.
- Tony, you look so handsome.

37:06.808 --> 37:08.185
Oh, please, come on in.

37:08.268 --> 37:10.145
Hey, what's with the tie?
It's not a funeral.

[chattering]

37:18.236 --> 37:19.529
Judy?

37:19.613 --> 37:22.574
- Father Gordon. Hi!
- Oh, my goodness!

37:22.658 --> 37:24.701
- [Father Gordon chuckles]
- It's so good to see you.

37:25.410 --> 37:27.663
- Honey?
- [sighs] You have gotten taller.

37:27.746 --> 37:28.789
[laughs]

37:28.872 --> 37:30.123
He always says that.

37:30.207 --> 37:33.001
Um, this is my boyfriend, Tony.

37:33.752 --> 37:36.546
Tony, this is my Father Gordon.

37:36.630 --> 37:37.589
[giggles]

37:37.673 --> 37:39.424
He used to work with my mom and dad.

37:39.508 --> 37:41.551
- It's nice to meet you, Tony.
- And you.

37:41.635 --> 37:43.762
So, what do you do?

37:44.346 --> 37:47.474
Oh, uh… I am between jobs, actually.

37:47.557 --> 37:48.600
Oh, okay.

37:48.684 --> 37:50.102
Tony was a police officer.

37:50.602 --> 37:52.145
Call it early retirement.

37:52.521 --> 37:54.731
You're quite young for retirement, son.

37:54.815 --> 37:55.857
[Father Gordon] Huh?

37:57.317 --> 37:58.610
Yeah, it's, uh…

37:58.694 --> 37:59.903
It's a long story.

38:01.655 --> 38:03.865
All right.
Be careful not to touch anything.

38:05.158 --> 38:08.829
So, everything you see in there
is either haunted, cursed,

38:08.912 --> 38:11.123
or has been used in some sort of, uh…

38:12.207 --> 38:13.709
ritualistic practice.

38:16.169 --> 38:17.045
What's in there?

38:18.380 --> 38:19.506
All the skeletons.

38:20.882 --> 38:22.134
What? Wait, really?

38:23.468 --> 38:24.678
Baby, hand me my beer.

38:26.930 --> 38:27.806
Thank you.

38:35.063 --> 38:36.064

38:39.067 --> 38:40.027
Hey.

38:40.944 --> 38:41.903
Smells good.

38:45.365 --> 38:46.992
S-Sorry, uh, I'm Tony.

38:48.285 --> 38:49.244
I know who you are.

38:50.120 --> 38:51.496
You're Judy's boyfriend.

38:52.539 --> 38:53.331
Yeah.

38:53.415 --> 38:55.333
Brad Hamilton.
I used to work with the Warrens.

38:56.001 --> 38:57.127
Oh…

38:57.836 --> 39:00.005
[whispering] What, like,

39:00.088 --> 39:01.214
Here and there, yeah.

39:01.298 --> 39:05.552
Sometimes consulting,
sometimes… security.

39:07.929 --> 39:10.557
Hey, did you ever see an exorcism?

39:10.891 --> 39:12.309
Did I ever see an exorcism?

39:14.144 --> 39:15.353
[whispering] Did I ever see an exorcism?

39:18.356 --> 39:21.276
Front row, baby. Right there.

39:21.902 --> 39:23.320
That's a battle scar.

39:23.403 --> 39:25.530
She nearly bit off my entire cheek.

39:25.614 --> 39:26.406
She did that?

39:26.490 --> 39:29.367
Yeah. [chuckling]
And they say Rhode Island's boring.

39:29.451 --> 39:32.746
[sharp inhale] I don't know.
Why don't you get a bun, Tony?

And Judy, um…

48:09.971 --> 48:12.307
…she's our little girl. [chuckles]

48:13.349 --> 48:17.854
And, um, you know, you're right,
it has been a very short time.

48:19.355 --> 48:22.525
But we barely knew each other
when we got engaged.

48:22.609 --> 48:24.319
- Well--
- Ed was shipping out.

48:25.153 --> 48:26.946
But I think that… I don't know,

48:27.488 --> 48:29.365
I think that we just knew.

48:32.744 --> 48:33.786
[Lorraine] Mm-hmm.

48:35.121 --> 48:37.624
Of course, you have our blessing.

48:37.707 --> 48:39.375
[chuckles]

48:39.459 --> 48:41.169
[inhales] Mr. Warren?

48:41.252 --> 48:42.587
Yeah, um…

48:44.631 --> 48:47.634
Tony, um… You're a good kid…

48:47.717 --> 48:48.593
Ed…

48:48.676 --> 48:51.387
And… Well, they've only known
each other six months.

48:51.471 --> 48:52.597
Don't be silly.

48:52.680 --> 48:54.307
But she just said that you guys--

48:54.390 --> 48:55.266
- Yeah, well, that…
- Yeah…

48:55.350 --> 48:57.143
…was a-a different time.

48:59.020 --> 49:00.146
Okay, um…

49:01.731 --> 49:03.358
Maybe this was too early?

49:03.733 --> 49:04.942
- Yeah, there we go.
- No.

49:05.026 --> 49:07.987
So, I will come back in a month and--

49:08.071 --> 49:09.072
A month?

49:09.781 --> 49:10.782
Ed…

49:14.285 --> 49:15.286
What is that?

49:16.913 --> 49:18.247
- Sh…
- Oh.

49:18.331 --> 49:19.207
- [ring clatters]
- [Judy gasps]

49:27.632 --> 49:28.883
Is that for me?

49:40.019 --> 49:40.770
Yes.

49:42.021 --> 49:44.399
- Judy, I was asking--
- Yes!

49:45.066 --> 49:48.361
Yes! Obviously, yes! [laugh]

49:50.029 --> 49:51.030
Yes!

49:54.283 --> 49:56.619
- [chuckles]
- It's beautiful.

49:57.745 --> 49:59.664
Is this why
you were so nervous in the car?

49:59.747 --> 50:01.374
- Sure was.
- [Lorraine and Judy laugh]

50:01.916 --> 50:04.836
- Did you see it?
- I did! I did.

50:04.919 --> 50:05.878
It's so pretty.

50:05.962 --> 50:07.880
- Oh, honey.
- Thank you, sir.

50:07.964 --> 50:09.882
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.

50:09.966 --> 50:11.092
So pretty.

50:12.468 --> 50:13.928
- You happy?
- Yeah.

50:14.470 --> 50:15.972
- Congrats, Tony.
- Thanks, man.

50:16.639 --> 50:18.641
You know, Tony, he seems like a good egg.

50:18.725 --> 50:20.560
Yeah, yeah…

50:21.894 --> 50:24.105
Judy's got good instincts.

50:24.188 --> 50:27.942
You just, have to let her go,
let her walk her own path.

50:28.359 --> 50:29.193
Yeah.

50:29.652 --> 50:31.696
Oh, uh, by the way…

50:32.739 --> 50:34.407
we've had a couple calls.

50:34.490 --> 50:37.452
Some families reaching out.
They could use your…

50:38.828 --> 50:40.288
special assistance.

50:40.371 --> 50:41.748
So, what are we talking about?
Are they local, or--

50:41.831 --> 50:42.832
Ed.

50:43.833 --> 50:45.084
- [groans]
- Yeah.

50:45.668 --> 50:48.337
We're sorry, Father.
Those days are behind us now.

50:48.421 --> 50:50.548
I know. I guess I just--

50:51.883 --> 50:53.050
I just had to try.

50:53.718 --> 50:55.303
- For old times' sake.
- Sure.

50:56.888 --> 50:58.306
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

50:58.389 --> 50:59.932
You look good for an old guy.

51:00.892 --> 51:02.769
[Ed and Lorraine chuckling]

51:03.978 --> 51:05.188
[sighs]

51:27.126 --> 51:28.920
[Dawn] <i>We're just gonna pretend,</i>
<i>like nothing's going on?</i>

51:29.003 --> 51:31.839
Father Jensen has submitted
our case to the archdiocese.

51:31.923 --> 51:33.174
And so what?

51:33.466 --> 51:35.885
You're just gonna let us
live in a haunted house?

51:35.968 --> 51:37.178
Don't talk to your father like that!

51:37.261 --> 51:38.721
It's all right, I got this, Mom.

51:38.805 --> 51:41.349
Just, please, stop fighting!

51:41.432 --> 51:42.767
Oh, honey…

51:43.267 --> 51:44.143
It's okay, honey.

51:44.227 --> 51:46.270
Please, Dad, can't we got to a motel?

51:46.354 --> 51:49.315
There's eight of us, sweetie.
We can't afford that.

51:49.398 --> 51:51.275
As I was saying, Father Jensen has said--

51:51.359 --> 51:52.443
"Father Jensen says."

51:52.527 --> 51:54.111
- God, I've heard that before.
- The church has a process.

51:55.154 --> 51:58.157
They work with people
who come and document…

51:59.116 --> 52:00.034
these things.

52:00.117 --> 52:01.077
"These things?"

52:01.160 --> 52:02.787
To prove it's all real!

52:03.162 --> 52:05.081
"To prove it's all real?"

52:05.540 --> 52:07.208
It's real!

52:07.291 --> 52:09.126
- It wants to kill us!
- No, no.

52:09.210 --> 52:10.253
No, it does!

52:12.547 --> 52:14.674
[crying]

52:14.757 --> 52:17.260
You-- You don't believe us, do you?

52:17.343 --> 52:18.386
- No, no. Dawn,
- Do you?

52:18.469 --> 52:19.804
- that is not what I am saying.
- No, you don't believe us.

52:19.887 --> 52:21.514
- That is not what I'm saying!
- You don't believe us,

52:21.597 --> 52:23.057
just 'cause it hasn't happened to you.

52:23.140 --> 52:24.517
It's happening to all of us!

52:24.600 --> 52:27.228
Not the same way it's happened to me, Dad!

52:27.562 --> 52:30.648
I cannot live like this anymore.
None of us can!

52:32.316 --> 52:33.401
Either you don't believe us,

52:33.484 --> 52:35.987
or you can't do anything about it.
Which is it?

52:41.409 --> 52:42.743
- Jesus fucking Christ…
- Dawn…

52:42.827 --> 52:43.786
- Hey!
- No, no.

52:43.870 --> 52:44.704
- I'm not gonna wait. Don't.
- Just leave it. No, no. Hon…

52:44.787 --> 52:47.081
Oh, no. Dawn. Come…

Everything you see in here

why do you keep them around?

01:12:43.735 --> 01:12:45.445
Why not just destroy them?

01:12:45.528 --> 01:12:48.990
It's complicated.
Sometimes that makes things worse.

01:12:49.532 --> 01:12:52.827
Sometimes… they just won't let you.

01:12:54.037 --> 01:12:56.539

A thousand?

01:13:07.383 --> 01:13:11.262
Yeah, well. We started young,
about your age.

01:13:13.723 --> 01:13:16.309
Mmm. It's funny. This room,

01:13:17.727 --> 01:13:19.562
every little thing in it…

01:13:21.147 --> 01:13:22.649

Listen, the other day?

01:13:32.951 --> 01:13:34.035
I get it.

01:13:34.119 --> 01:13:38.998
Yeah I-- I was just… nervous,
and you're kinda intimidating.

01:13:39.082 --> 01:13:40.708
[Ed] We almost lost Judy.

01:13:43.211 --> 01:13:44.671
She was stillborn.

01:13:48.383 --> 01:13:49.843
For probably a minute.

01:13:53.263 --> 01:13:55.765
It was the longest minute of our lives.

01:13:57.934 --> 01:14:01.479
And as a parent,
that's something you never forget.

01:14:05.066 --> 01:14:06.901
So, while I know she's your fiancée,

01:14:09.571 --> 01:14:10.697
for us,

01:14:11.406 --> 01:14:15.952
she will always be that little baby,
fighting for her life.

01:14:18.705 --> 01:14:20.123
I understand, sir.

01:14:23.168 --> 01:14:24.377
Do you?

- [Lorraine sighs]
- What?

01:14:36.014 --> 01:14:39.976
Father Gordon, he was a good man.

01:14:41.728 --> 01:14:43.146
A man of God.

01:14:44.564 --> 01:14:46.733
And he helped so many people.

01:14:47.483 --> 01:14:50.612
I didn't know Father
to be a man of despair.

01:14:51.404 --> 01:14:54.699
No, Father Gordon was light.

01:14:57.035 --> 01:15:00.288
And he brought that light
to me and my family,

01:15:00.371 --> 01:15:02.832
when we needed him most. [crying]

[Ed] Yes?

I'm sorry, we never met.
My name is Father Ziegler.

01:16:32.505 --> 01:16:37.093
You're actually both a bit infamous
within certain circles of the church.

01:16:37.635 --> 01:16:39.304
Yes, we're aware.

01:16:39.387 --> 01:16:41.681
But Gordon always spoke highly of you.

01:16:41.764 --> 01:16:45.351
He believed in the mission.
And the things you did together.

01:16:45.435 --> 01:16:47.353
He considered you both friends.

01:16:47.437 --> 01:16:48.563
Thank you, Father.

Yes?

01:16:57.947 --> 01:16:59.449
Mm.

01:17:00.241 --> 01:17:01.659
Where was it?

01:17:05.913 --> 01:17:07.248
Pennsylvania.

01:17:08.333 --> 01:17:10.418

What are you doing out here?
This is not like you.

01:21:13.119 --> 01:21:16.247
Father Gordon was here.
He came here just before he died.

01:21:16.330 --> 01:21:18.541
I put two and two together,
and I found them.

01:21:18.624 --> 01:21:20.751
- It's been going on for months.
- We need to go.

01:21:20.835 --> 01:21:23.212
What? No. Mom. Mom.

01:21:23.296 --> 01:21:25.172
I'm so sorry. Ed, we need to go.

01:21:25.256 --> 01:21:26.591
- You're leaving?
- Yes, we're leaving.

Wait, what?

01:21:27.675 --> 01:21:28.926
Really sorry if we've intruded.

- We can't leave!
- We can't stay.

01:21:30.386 --> 01:21:31.429
- We can talk about this outside.
- Mom!

01:21:31.512 --> 01:21:32.513
It's been a long drive.

01:21:32.597 --> 01:21:34.348

- Stop!

We don't run from fights, right?

01:21:47.903 --> 01:21:49.655
I mean, that's what
you'd always tell each other,

01:21:49.739 --> 01:21:51.949
when there was a family
that needed you.

01:21:54.785 --> 01:21:58.497
As a kid, I didn't understand
why you had to leave.

01:21:59.373 --> 01:22:02.752
Why you gave so much of yourselves
to people you didn't know.

01:22:04.295 --> 01:22:06.088
And even now, I don't know.

But we're all here now.

01:22:15.640 --> 01:22:18.309
And they need us.

01:22:29.820 --> 01:22:31.697
They need you.

Any comments for us?

01:23:06.190 --> 01:23:08.734
[reporter] Mr. Warren, do
you think it's a real haunting?

01:23:11.612 --> 01:23:13.698
We should have never gone to the press.

01:23:13.781 --> 01:23:16.200
Now our neighbors can't stand us.

01:23:16.283 --> 01:23:18.077
They think we wanted this.

01:23:18.869 --> 01:23:21.163
I didn't know
it was gonna turn into a circus.

01:23:21.247 --> 01:23:23.666
We wanted someone like you, experts.

01:23:23.749 --> 01:23:25.126
People who've dealt with this before.

01:23:25.209 --> 01:23:28.421
L-Let's… take this back
to the beginning. When did it start?

01:23:28.504 --> 01:23:31.090
- Uh, Heather's confirmation.
- Yeah.

01:23:31.173 --> 01:23:33.175
What do you mean, you saw him die?

01:23:33.509 --> 01:23:34.510
[shushes]

01:23:35.970 --> 01:23:37.304
I mean, were you here?

01:23:37.388 --> 01:23:40.307
No, back home. In a vision.

01:23:40.391 --> 01:23:42.852
But… it was different.

01:23:42.935 --> 01:23:43.936
Did you tell your mom?

01:23:44.019 --> 01:23:47.565
No. I can't talk to her anymore.
She's always so…

01:23:48.315 --> 01:23:50.234
- Worried.
- Yeah.

01:23:51.402 --> 01:23:52.820
There's something else.

01:23:53.320 --> 01:23:56.240
I don't know how to say it,
but it's like…

01:23:57.950 --> 01:24:02.705
…something wants me to be here.

01:24:04.248 --> 01:24:07.084
So your parents were living here?

01:24:07.168 --> 01:24:08.836
Which one of you? Which parents?

01:24:09.670 --> 01:24:13.174
Yeah, they've been with us all along,
since we moved in, and um…

01:24:55.674 --> 01:24:57.676
[lullaby playing]

01:25:16.987 --> 01:25:17.905

01:25:36.841 --> 01:25:38.551
[Simon panting]

01:25:38.926 --> 01:25:40.928
He started making pancakes.

01:25:42.847 --> 01:25:43.722
[Tony grunts]

01:25:46.225 --> 01:25:49.311
So, is this, like, a normal case?

01:25:50.312 --> 01:25:52.523
[chuckles] They're never normal.

01:25:53.148 --> 01:25:56.277
No, I mean, do you always cook pancakes?

01:25:56.360 --> 01:25:58.737
Is that part of the process?

01:26:06.078 --> 01:26:07.663
Sometimes it's waffles.

01:26:08.747 --> 01:26:10.541
[both laughing]

01:26:13.043 --> 01:26:15.296
[Ed] No, every case is different.

01:26:15.880 --> 01:26:17.214
Every family's different.

01:26:18.173 --> 01:26:21.510
One thing that's always the same
is the fear.

01:26:22.344 --> 01:26:24.013
You can see it in their eyes.

01:26:25.347 --> 01:26:27.224
And a demon will prey on that.

01:26:27.933 --> 01:26:30.519
It'll try to isolate them,
use their fears against them.

01:26:30.603 --> 01:26:32.688
So part of the job is just…

01:26:34.106 --> 01:26:35.900
letting them know they're not alone.

01:26:37.192 --> 01:26:38.235
Right.

01:26:42.740 --> 01:26:44.366
Judy told me you were a cop.

01:26:45.284 --> 01:26:47.286
What happened? Why'd you quit?

01:26:47.369 --> 01:26:48.370
It's nothing.

01:26:56.295 --> 01:26:58.339
Okay, so…

01:26:59.506 --> 01:27:00.507
I was working in Bloomfield.

01:27:01.717 --> 01:27:04.219
You know, small town.
Nothing ever happens.

01:27:04.845 --> 01:27:07.640
Me and my partner,
we get a domestic violence call.

01:27:09.058 --> 01:27:13.437
And we pull up to the house,
and we hear fighting inside.

01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:15.940
So, I knock on the door.

01:27:16.774 --> 01:27:18.025
And immediately,

01:27:18.108 --> 01:27:20.152
the door flies open,

01:27:20.235 --> 01:27:23.572
and this guy shoves
a twelve-gauge shotgun right in my face.

01:27:24.949 --> 01:27:27.326
And I hear… click.

01:27:28.494 --> 01:27:29.828
I, uh…

01:27:30.329 --> 01:27:33.916
I unfreeze,
and, uh, we take the guy down.

01:27:34.375 --> 01:27:35.584
Arrest him.

01:27:37.628 --> 01:27:40.255
Later, my partner comes up to me,

01:27:40.339 --> 01:27:43.258
and he says, "You're a dead man."

01:27:45.010 --> 01:27:46.345
He shows me the shotgun.

01:27:48.222 --> 01:27:49.181
It was loaded.

01:27:50.516 --> 01:27:52.393
- Primer was struck on the shell.
- [exhales]

01:27:52.476 --> 01:27:53.644
Misfire.

01:27:55.813 --> 01:27:59.566
I figure, there's a world where I'm dead.

01:28:01.110 --> 01:28:03.612
Where I never grow old.

01:28:04.530 --> 01:28:06.323
I never have kids.

01:28:06.949 --> 01:28:08.993
I never get to marry your daughter.

01:28:14.665 --> 01:28:17.626
So next day, I-I quit,

01:28:18.210 --> 01:28:20.796
and I go out and buy that ring for Judy.

01:28:30.681 --> 01:28:32.558
[spatula scraping on pan]

01:28:32.933 --> 01:28:35.811
<i>- This is my wastepaper basket, Bert.</i>
<i>- Of course, it's your waste basket!</i>

01:28:35.894 --> 01:28:37.604
<i>- Oh, yeah.</i>
<i>- You put it on my head!</i>

01:28:37.688 --> 01:28:39.523
<i>- Thank you, Bert.</i>
<i>- "Thank you?"</i>

01:28:39.606 --> 01:28:40.607

01:28:42.651 --> 01:28:45.112

[chatter on television]

01:28:47.197 --> 01:28:49.408
[Judy] Should we do a silly face? Yeah?

01:28:49.491 --> 01:28:50.534

01:29:04.214 --> 01:29:06.550
Sorry, the flash was supposed to be off.

[flashbulb whines]

01:29:09.845 --> 01:29:11.472
I just thought I could…

01:29:13.307 --> 01:29:14.725
…document it all.

01:29:19.146 --> 01:29:20.230
Everything okay?

01:29:21.899 --> 01:29:22.983
Yeah.

01:29:23.067 --> 01:29:25.069
[television chatter continues]

01:29:30.574 --> 01:29:34.286
I just realized,
I've never seen you guys at work.

01:29:36.413 --> 01:29:37.706
[distant whisper]

01:29:46.423 --> 01:29:47.800
I feel it, too.

01:29:56.725 --> 01:29:58.352
- [inhales]
- Stay here.

01:29:58.435 --> 01:30:01.105
- Mom, I can help.
- Judy, you promised.

01:30:53.448 --> 01:30:54.449
Sorry.

01:30:54.533 --> 01:30:55.450
[Judy] It's okay.

01:30:56.660 --> 01:30:58.287
Uh, what's her name?

01:30:58.871 --> 01:30:59.997
This is Susie.

01:31:00.789 --> 01:31:02.082
Hey, Susie.

01:31:03.333 --> 01:31:04.918
Do you like dolls?

01:31:05.544 --> 01:31:06.920
Uh…

01:31:08.297 --> 01:31:09.464
Not really.

[voices crescendo, fade]

01:33:05.122 --> 01:33:07.499
The spirits, there are three of them.

01:33:08.625 --> 01:33:11.920
They never lived in this house,
but on this land.

01:33:13.880 --> 01:33:15.424
This was farmland.

01:33:18.969 --> 01:33:20.178
Uh…

01:33:22.222 --> 01:33:23.890
There was a woman.

01:33:24.766 --> 01:33:27.019
She was wild. She…

01:33:28.312 --> 01:33:30.022
Just so tormented.

01:33:30.814 --> 01:33:33.400
She had an affair, and…

01:33:34.651 --> 01:33:37.195
…her husband went insane.

01:33:38.238 --> 01:33:41.283
He took an axe, and he went after her.

01:33:41.366 --> 01:33:45.078
She hid in the basement,
but she wasn't alone.

01:33:45.162 --> 01:33:47.539
She went with her elderly mother.

01:33:49.958 --> 01:33:52.753
- And he killed them both.
- Look, we've seen

01:33:52.836 --> 01:33:55.005
violent manifestations like that before.

01:33:55.088 --> 01:33:56.673
So why is this different?

01:33:56.757 --> 01:33:58.967
The three spirits are a façade.

01:33:59.259 --> 01:34:01.928
Something else is blocking my vision.

01:34:02.846 --> 01:34:04.348
Hiding behind them.

01:34:05.265 --> 01:34:06.391
Demonic?

01:34:08.101 --> 01:34:11.772
It's controlling the spirits.
It's using them against the Smurls.

01:34:11.855 --> 01:34:15.817
But what's it want?
I mean, this has been going on for months.

01:34:16.777 --> 01:34:18.236
What's it waiting for?

01:34:24.659 --> 01:34:25.494
[Lorraine's voice] Judy!

01:34:28.080 --> 01:34:29.247
Mom?

01:34:29.331 --> 01:34:30.916
[Lorraine's voice]
Can you come up here, please?

01:34:53.814 --> 01:34:54.940
Mom?

01:37:04.694 --> 01:37:06.488
[stops]

01:37:06.571 --> 01:37:07.572
Oh.

01:37:08.240 --> 01:37:09.115
[rattle]

01:37:09.699 --> 01:37:10.575

[Carin's voice] Judy?

01:38:00.166 --> 01:38:01.167
[Carin's voice] Are you there?

01:38:02.127 --> 01:38:03.211
Carin?

01:38:39.331 --> 01:38:41.333
[ragged breathing]

01:38:44.878 --> 01:38:46.212

[joints crunching, popping]

01:38:52.052 --> 01:38:53.345
[discordant piano plays]

[Judy hyperventilating]

[yelps]

01:39:12.530 --> 01:39:14.532
[screaming]

01:39:15.492 --> 01:39:16.951
- [Ed] Judy!
- [Lorraine] Judy!

01:39:17.827 --> 01:39:19.329
- [groans]
- [Lorraine gasps]

01:39:19.412 --> 01:39:20.705
Your head!

01:39:20.789 --> 01:39:22.832
- What happened?
- [Judy whimpers]

01:39:25.210 --> 01:39:27.087
[Judy's breath catches]

01:39:28.630 --> 01:39:30.256
There's something in the attic.

01:39:39.474 --> 01:39:40.892
It can't be.

01:39:41.726 --> 01:39:45.939
[exhales] It… found us.

01:39:52.028 --> 01:39:53.196
Lorraine?

01:39:58.952 --> 01:40:01.162
No, Lorraine. No, don't.

01:40:15.260 --> 01:40:18.430
Ed, something's changed.

01:40:20.974 --> 01:40:22.934
- Something's different.
- [engine turns over]

01:40:30.275 --> 01:40:33.361
[Ed] <i>Then, after about a week,</i>
<i>Judy recovered.</i>

01:40:33.778 --> 01:40:36.197
The doctors said
they'd never seen anything like it.

01:40:37.323 --> 01:40:39.075
[sighs] She was a miracle.

01:40:40.452 --> 01:40:43.830
But as for that mirror,
we never saw it again…

01:40:45.832 --> 01:40:47.125
…until today.

01:40:48.251 --> 01:40:51.588
[Dawn] <i>But I don't understand.</i>
<i>Heather and I threw that thing away.</i>

01:40:51.671 --> 01:40:54.799
[Lorraine] <i>With these things,</i>
<i>it's never that simple.</i>

01:40:55.925 --> 01:41:00.180
<i>It wasn't done with you,</i>
<i>and it wasn't done with us.</i>

01:41:02.974 --> 01:41:04.809
Okay, so then what happened to the woman

01:41:05.894 --> 01:41:07.729
from the antique store?

01:41:11.316 --> 01:41:12.275
We don't know.

01:41:12.650 --> 01:41:13.860
Uh…

01:41:15.069 --> 01:41:16.279
We never went back.

01:41:17.280 --> 01:41:20.366
That thing in your attic is a demon.

01:41:20.700 --> 01:41:22.911
It's the first one
that we ever encountered.

01:41:24.120 --> 01:41:28.666
We were young, and we were scared,
and we almost lost our daughter.

01:41:30.001 --> 01:41:33.004
So, we told ourselves that
the risk was just too great,

01:41:33.087 --> 01:41:35.215
so we couldn't chance going back.

01:41:36.674 --> 01:41:38.092
So, yes.

01:41:40.053 --> 01:41:41.262
We ran away.

01:41:44.974 --> 01:41:45.892
[Jack] I'll…

01:41:46.976 --> 01:41:49.646
…take it as a good sign
you're still here.

01:41:49.729 --> 01:41:51.064
Mm.

01:41:51.147 --> 01:41:52.315
We're not leaving you.

01:41:54.609 --> 01:41:55.485
[Judy coughs]

01:41:55.568 --> 01:41:57.362
[hacking coughs]

01:41:59.989 --> 01:42:01.074
[Judy clears her throat]

01:42:01.157 --> 01:42:01.991
[Tony] Some water?

01:42:02.492 --> 01:42:03.618
Sorry. [sniffles]

01:42:04.494 --> 01:42:05.328
[Heather] So, what now?

01:42:06.704 --> 01:42:07.997
How do you get rid of it?

01:42:09.666 --> 01:42:12.794
Ed! You're really
gonna take that thing home?

01:42:12.877 --> 01:42:14.379
We can't leave it here.

01:42:14.462 --> 01:42:16.923
Artifact room is the only place
that can contain it.

01:42:20.802 --> 01:42:24.889
All right, West Pittston,
back home to Monroe. Take 80.

01:42:24.973 --> 01:42:27.308
Lorraine and Judy can stay behind.
Wait, 84 is faster.

01:42:27.392 --> 01:42:29.227
Eighty is much quicker this time of night.

01:42:31.104 --> 01:42:33.189
Listen to me, whatever happens tonight,

01:42:33.273 --> 01:42:35.275
you have got to do what I say, okay?

01:42:36.317 --> 01:42:37.151
Got it.

01:42:40.822 --> 01:42:42.156
[thunder rumbling]

01:42:42.866 --> 01:42:44.117
What? What is it?

01:42:48.329 --> 01:42:49.289
It's nothin'.

01:42:50.331 --> 01:42:51.291
Everything okay?

01:42:51.374 --> 01:42:53.418
I-It's just something Lorraine said.

01:42:55.545 --> 01:42:57.046
Something feels different.

01:42:58.756 --> 01:43:00.383
[thunder rumbles]

01:43:02.093 --> 01:43:03.261
[coughing weakly]

01:43:03.344 --> 01:43:05.054
[thunder rolling]

01:43:09.893 --> 01:43:12.186
Mom, I'm-- I'm sorry.

01:43:12.645 --> 01:43:14.272
No, I'm sorry.

01:43:15.148 --> 01:43:17.358
I should have never let you stay.

01:43:22.697 --> 01:43:25.283
Once we start, there's no going back.

01:43:26.618 --> 01:43:27.744
Don't look at it.

01:43:29.203 --> 01:43:31.748
And don't touch it directly.

01:43:32.498 --> 01:43:33.917
Just keep your gloves on.

01:43:34.542 --> 01:43:35.752
Anything can happen.

01:43:37.253 --> 01:43:39.130
And most likely, anything will.

01:43:39.213 --> 01:43:40.506
[paper rustling]

01:43:41.799 --> 01:43:42.759
[Ed sighs]

01:43:45.219 --> 01:43:46.721
"St. Michael the Archangel,

- I'll get the car ready.
- Yeah.

01:44:12.246 --> 01:44:13.498
- We'll be down in a second.
All right.

01:44:16.709 --> 01:44:17.585
- [strained] You ready?
- Yeah.

01:44:17.669 --> 01:44:19.295
Two, three… Yeah.

[Dawn] Come on, Simon!

01:44:23.591 --> 01:44:25.176
- Come on! Be a good boy.
- Come on!

- Girls, get him outta here.
- [barking]

01:44:27.095 --> 01:44:28.137
We're trying!

01:44:29.430 --> 01:44:32.016
So, is it just drywall
underneath the insulation?

01:44:32.475 --> 01:44:33.142
Yeah.
