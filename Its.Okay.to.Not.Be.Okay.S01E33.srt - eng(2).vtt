WEBVTT

00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:03.336
Miss Mia, I'm sorry about last night.

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:08.550
Because I hit you with
a pillow and pulled your hair.

00:00:08.633 --> 00:00:11.428
I'm sorry, too. Because I also hurt you.

00:00:11.511 --> 00:00:13.930
You can keep Satsat.

00:00:14.014 --> 00:00:17.642
But that's the last thing
you can take from Matmat.

00:00:17.726 --> 00:00:19.144
- Okay?
- Okay.

00:00:19.227 --> 00:00:19.978
Welcome back!

00:00:20.061 --> 00:00:23.064
I thought you wouldn't
want to teach here again.

00:00:23.148 --> 00:00:25.567
I heard the patients love my stories.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:26.943
I thought you only agreed

00:00:27.027 --> 00:00:29.654
because you found out
Patrick had requested it.

00:00:29.738 --> 00:00:32.407
He requested for me to come back.

00:00:32.824 --> 00:00:34.993
Hey! That's sweet.

00:00:35.076 --> 00:00:36.119
Do you know who left this?

00:00:36.202 --> 00:00:37.120
There's two possibilities.

00:00:37.203 --> 00:00:39.998
Either they're into you
or they've got beef with you.

00:01:34.511 --> 00:01:36.054
Why? What's going on?

00:01:39.057 --> 00:01:40.391
Is this a bribe?

00:01:41.768 --> 00:01:46.356
{\an8}Hey, Ma'am Eden might see it.
It's not allowed for patients.

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.067
{\an8}I just snuck it in for your locker.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.611
{\an8}You're not supposed to sneak that in.

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.906
{\an8}Why do other rooms get snacks?
Can't I have any?

00:01:54.989 --> 00:01:57.117
{\an8}Kai, don't change the subject.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.619
{\an8}- That piaya--
Fine, bro.

00:02:01.037 --> 00:02:01.871
{\an8}Err.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.458
{\an8}I only did it to make it up to you…

00:02:06.584 --> 00:02:10.713
{\an8}since you haven't yet told
Doc about me and Bella.

00:02:13.716 --> 00:02:14.968
{\an8}I'm still thinking about it.

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:20.598
{\an8}Come on, don't tell him.

00:02:20.682 --> 00:02:26.437
{\an8}Bella and I decided
to just get better first.

00:02:26.521 --> 00:02:30.567
{\an8}And when we get out, we'll be together.

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.486
{\an8}Really? What if I catch you again?

00:02:35.572 --> 00:02:37.574
I'm trying…

00:02:40.577 --> 00:02:42.078
but it's hard.

00:02:43.746 --> 00:02:45.748
I really fell for her.

00:02:45.832 --> 00:02:48.877
You know?
No matter how hard I try to focus,

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.005
her face is always on my mind.

00:02:54.215 --> 00:02:59.095
Even if I tell myself to stay away…

00:02:59.178 --> 00:03:02.181
Get out! She'll kill you!

00:03:02.265 --> 00:03:05.643
- Mia, you're just dreaming!
- Get out now!

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:08.146
I'm here. I'm not leaving, okay?

00:03:15.987 --> 00:03:17.363
Uh…

00:03:17.447 --> 00:03:19.365
I'd run away with you.

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.078
Just say when and I'll drop everything.

00:03:45.183 --> 00:03:46.976
Just one look from her…

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:52.607
and you're already affected.

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.990
Even if you know…

00:04:03.618 --> 00:04:06.746
that you shouldn't follow your heart.

00:04:10.541 --> 00:04:11.834
But what can you do?

00:04:13.628 --> 00:04:15.713
When your head…

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.425
and heart keep shouting…

00:04:21.094 --> 00:04:22.262
…her name.

00:04:37.235 --> 00:04:39.862
You're a fool, Patrick.

00:04:42.573 --> 00:04:44.993
What? You're in love with Mia?

00:04:49.038 --> 00:04:53.710
{\an8}Everyone knows "Beauty and the Beast"
as a classic romantic love story.

00:04:54.627 --> 00:04:56.504
{\an8}Well, I'm sorry to burst your bubble.

00:04:57.297 --> 00:05:00.425
{\an8}For me, it's Stockholm syndrome.

00:05:01.092 --> 00:05:02.802
{\an8}What's Stockholm syndrome?

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:04.929
{\an8}Stockholm syndrome…

00:05:06.973 --> 00:05:10.601
{\an8}Imagine a kidnapper and his victim.

00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:15.189
{\an8}Usually, the victim hates the kidnapper--

00:05:15.273 --> 00:05:17.442
Because she was taken by force.

00:05:17.525 --> 00:05:19.444
And the kidnapper could hurt her.

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:20.862
Correct.

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:23.156
But with Stockholm syndrome,

00:05:24.198 --> 00:05:26.909
the kidnapper acts kind,

00:05:28.161 --> 00:05:31.205
is caring, talks to you.

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:34.167
He wins over the victim,

00:05:34.834 --> 00:05:38.755
until the victim's view
of the kidnapper changes.

00:05:39.881 --> 00:05:41.799
Same with the Beast.

00:05:52.643 --> 00:05:56.564
Huh? The Beast wasn't a kidnapper.

00:05:56.647 --> 00:06:02.945
He locked Beauty in the palace
in exchange for her father's freedom.

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:05.907
Then he ordered
her around and yelled at her.

00:06:06.616 --> 00:06:09.827
That's a beast for you.

00:06:10.369 --> 00:06:11.329
Mm-hmm.

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.040
But Belle wondered

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:17.376
about the Beast…

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:20.213
When he's alone, he's gentle.

00:06:22.006 --> 00:06:24.967
"What if he's just lonely?"

00:06:26.094 --> 00:06:28.513
"What if I love him?
Maybe I can change him."

00:06:29.305 --> 00:06:31.432
That's how she got trapped.

00:06:31.516 --> 00:06:33.059
That's the wrong mindset.

00:06:33.559 --> 00:06:38.439
Her brain tricked her
into thinking that it's love.

00:06:41.025 --> 00:06:45.113
But truth is, she was in survival mode.

00:06:45.613 --> 00:06:48.783
That's Stockholm syndrome.

00:06:48.866 --> 00:06:49.992
Exactly.

00:06:53.079 --> 00:06:54.080
It's not.

00:06:54.914 --> 00:06:56.082
No.

00:07:00.962 --> 00:07:03.840
"Beauty and the Beast" was a love story.

00:07:09.428 --> 00:07:13.933
About true love's power to change someone.

00:07:14.559 --> 00:07:15.768
That's it.

00:07:22.191 --> 00:07:27.572
When you love, you choose to be better.

00:07:34.078 --> 00:07:35.788
Love…

00:07:37.498 --> 00:07:42.003
…makes you calm
yourself just so you won't hurt others.

00:07:49.302 --> 00:07:52.013
I'm destructive and loud

00:07:52.096 --> 00:07:55.600
and you are my safety pin
that makes sure I won't explode.

00:07:55.683 --> 00:07:58.644
Promise me you won't
fight Matmat when I'm not around.

00:07:58.728 --> 00:08:00.229
But if you're there, I can?

00:08:00.313 --> 00:08:02.899
- Mia… and--
- Yes to all.

00:08:08.321 --> 00:08:10.656
- Ugly.
- What?

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:12.492
Shh. Mia.

00:08:18.581 --> 00:08:22.502
To be the best version of yourself.

00:08:26.464 --> 00:08:27.882
Thank you, Mia.

00:08:29.342 --> 00:08:32.136
You freed Miss Elvie.

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:37.058
["Being With You" instrumental continues

00:08:37.141 --> 00:08:39.393
I think I did a great job.

00:08:40.561 --> 00:08:42.230
Good job, Mia.

00:08:43.564 --> 00:08:44.732
I'm proud of you.

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:50.071
That's what
Beauty did for the Beast.

00:08:52.365 --> 00:08:56.285
She embraced his broken
heart and he became human again.

00:09:05.002 --> 00:09:09.549
Are you acting like this because
your name Bella sounds like Belle?

00:09:10.424 --> 00:09:14.637
Maybe it's time for her meds.

00:09:16.556 --> 00:09:19.517
Bella, you're right.
No, no, Bella's right.

00:09:20.851 --> 00:09:21.852
That's love.

00:09:23.479 --> 00:09:25.523
Beauty was in love with the Beast.

00:09:32.572 --> 00:09:33.781
It can't be.

00:09:38.828 --> 00:09:40.079
Was she in love?

00:09:41.998 --> 00:09:43.374
Miss Mia, it's possible.

00:09:43.457 --> 00:09:44.875
Like the saying,

00:09:45.459 --> 00:09:47.044
"When it comes to love,

00:09:47.712 --> 00:09:49.755
the impossible becomes possible."

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:06.230
I'm sorry Doc.

00:10:06.981 --> 00:10:09.066
I am not turning over my patient.

00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:14.905
I believe that Samuel is getting
the best treatment under my supervision.

00:10:16.616 --> 00:10:17.658
Olivia?

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:19.577
Doc, I think that

00:10:20.453 --> 00:10:25.374
the patient might not fully recover
because of familiarization.

00:10:29.128 --> 00:10:30.129
Here.

00:10:31.964 --> 00:10:34.967
Write your names there. Let's settle this.

00:10:43.434 --> 00:10:45.686
Can't the both of us
just supervise him together?

00:10:47.313 --> 00:10:50.232
I prefer only one
manages him for accountability.

00:10:50.316 --> 00:10:53.694
And so that your nurses
won't get confused.

00:10:54.403 --> 00:10:57.698
Okay. Here's the big decision.

00:10:58.574 --> 00:11:01.827
And we'll do this by drawing lots.

00:11:01.911 --> 00:11:03.329
Let's settle this.

00:11:06.374 --> 00:11:07.375
Here.

00:11:10.127 --> 00:11:14.006
So, whoever gets
picked will take care of Samuel?

00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:15.341
That's right.

00:11:16.801 --> 00:11:17.760
Huh?

00:11:18.386 --> 00:11:20.304
You're going in the draw?

00:11:20.388 --> 00:11:22.890
I'll be in charge of him if I get picked.

00:11:23.349 --> 00:11:25.726
Okay, let's do this.

00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:31.190
I hope it's not me.

00:11:38.239 --> 00:11:42.701
The name starts with a vowel.

00:11:43.869 --> 00:11:47.790
Doc, all of our names start with a vowel.

00:11:47.873 --> 00:11:49.834
Anok. Olivia. Eden.

00:11:50.709 --> 00:11:52.753
But only one has the letter I.

00:11:54.338 --> 00:11:56.006
Congratulations, Olivia.

00:11:56.090 --> 00:11:57.258
Thank you.

00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:00.511
You know,

00:12:01.595 --> 00:12:03.889
I'm glad that you're so passionate

00:12:03.973 --> 00:12:05.933
about taking care of your patients.

00:12:06.767 --> 00:12:08.644
This is one of the things I consider

00:12:08.727 --> 00:12:11.480
when recommending
someone for the manager position.

00:12:12.565 --> 00:12:15.901
And Olivia, I only agreed to this turnover

00:12:15.985 --> 00:12:18.821
because I want
the best outcome for Samuel.

00:12:21.532 --> 00:12:24.743
Leave it to me, Doc.
I'll take care of the patient.

00:12:25.536 --> 00:12:26.495
Excuse me, Doc.

00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:33.127
]

00:12:39.508 --> 00:12:41.051
My beast.

00:12:42.052 --> 00:12:43.012
Patrick.

00:12:57.735 --> 00:13:00.988
I had the most interesting class today.

00:13:02.031 --> 00:13:03.073
Mia, stop.

00:13:04.325 --> 00:13:05.701
I'm working.

00:13:07.119 --> 00:13:08.579
So I can do it at home?

00:13:17.755 --> 00:13:19.298
We need to talk.

00:13:22.635 --> 00:13:24.178
It's about your father.

00:13:27.431 --> 00:13:28.516
Him?

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:32.061
We were informed that another nurse,

00:13:32.144 --> 00:13:34.688
will be in charge of Mister Samuel
instead of Nurse Eden from now on.

00:13:34.772 --> 00:13:37.816
As if I care who's in charge of him.

00:13:38.984 --> 00:13:40.569
- Mia--
- Don't follow me

00:13:40.653 --> 00:13:42.613
if we're just going to talk about that.

00:13:52.998 --> 00:13:54.542
He's really my beast.

00:13:57.962 --> 00:13:58.963
Mia.

00:14:00.965 --> 00:14:02.591
Mia, can we talk?

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:04.718
About what?

00:14:04.802 --> 00:14:06.387
About your father.

00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:08.639
I already know you'll be in charge of him.

00:14:08.722 --> 00:14:10.391
There's nothing more to talk about.

00:14:10.474 --> 00:14:11.308
Good luck.

00:14:11.392 --> 00:14:13.102
- Mia--
- Don't touch me!

00:14:13.894 --> 00:14:15.646
Your father needs you.

00:14:17.439 --> 00:14:19.608
No one can tell me what to do.

00:14:20.651 --> 00:14:23.529
Especially someone like you.

00:14:24.488 --> 00:14:26.949
I'm just worried
about the patient's well-being.

00:14:27.825 --> 00:14:30.578
Don't drag me into
your and your father's fight.

00:14:35.082 --> 00:14:36.876
It's your eyes.

00:14:41.797 --> 00:14:43.132
I hate them.

00:14:55.436 --> 00:14:58.147
You think you got
what you want now, Olivia?

00:15:29.887 --> 00:15:31.305
She's dead.

00:15:33.057 --> 00:15:34.058
Why…

00:15:35.017 --> 00:15:36.894
Why is she here?

00:16:37.121 --> 00:16:38.247
Wow.

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:41.208
That's a beautiful work of art, Matmat.

00:16:42.209 --> 00:16:44.586
Thank you, Ma'am Olivia.

00:16:46.046 --> 00:16:48.048
But don't you think something's missing--

00:16:48.132 --> 00:16:50.551
D-Don't touch anything.

00:16:51.427 --> 00:16:54.680
Matmat is the painter.
He'll take care of it.

00:16:56.306 --> 00:16:59.226
Sorry. You're right. Sorry.

00:17:00.728 --> 00:17:02.104
Don't touch anything.

00:17:02.187 --> 00:17:04.314
Only Matmat can touch it.

00:17:07.109 --> 00:17:10.571
You're the one
who created it, so it's your call.

00:17:10.654 --> 00:17:11.655
It's your work of art.

00:17:12.364 --> 00:17:13.490
Sorry.

00:17:17.703 --> 00:17:20.372
Are you going
to poke your nose into everything?

00:17:21.081 --> 00:17:22.249
First, Samuel.

00:17:23.083 --> 00:17:24.084
Now Matmat.

00:17:25.002 --> 00:17:27.755
What's next, the whole hospital?

00:17:28.964 --> 00:17:30.632
Chill, Eden.

00:17:30.716 --> 00:17:32.426
I just want to help.

00:17:44.563 --> 00:17:45.439
Bella!

00:17:46.023 --> 00:17:47.024
Bella!

00:17:47.775 --> 00:17:50.277
- Bella!
- Excuse me sir, what's wrong?

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:51.528
Where's Bella?

00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:04.833
Gani, I'll take it from here.

00:18:05.417 --> 00:18:06.585
Okay, ma'am.

00:18:38.367 --> 00:18:39.785
We're together now.

00:18:41.537 --> 00:18:43.122
We'll never be apart again.

00:19:01.849 --> 00:19:03.308
Alright, let's talk.

00:19:09.982 --> 00:19:11.817
- Well, how have you been?
- Doc.

00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:16.321
Doc, is it really okay for
Bella to meet her ex boyfriend?

00:19:16.405 --> 00:19:18.490
She agreed to meet him.

00:19:18.574 --> 00:19:21.118
But didn't he used to abuse her?

00:19:21.201 --> 00:19:22.578
She shouldn't meet him again.

00:19:22.661 --> 00:19:28.125
So, he's the reason
Bella's traumatized and staying here now.

00:19:28.208 --> 00:19:29.376
You're right, Mister Tommy.

00:19:29.459 --> 00:19:31.628
Bella should file
a restraining order against him

00:19:31.712 --> 00:19:33.088
so he can't get near her again.

00:19:34.298 --> 00:19:35.966
But, Cynthia,

00:19:36.049 --> 00:19:40.220
It's not easy to cut off
someone whom you thought

00:19:40.304 --> 00:19:42.139
really loved you.

00:19:42.931 --> 00:19:45.434
Bella's parents been working
abroad ever since she was young.

00:19:46.143 --> 00:19:49.188
She lived with her ex-boyfriend
because she thought

00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:51.815
he could be her family.

00:19:52.774 --> 00:19:54.651
Someone who'd always be there for her.

00:19:54.735 --> 00:19:58.989
Jerome, I'll never believe you again.

00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:03.952
Bella.

00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:07.164
Bella, don't walk out on me.

00:20:09.833 --> 00:20:11.084
Bella!

00:20:14.129 --> 00:20:15.047
Bella!

00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:17.341
Can you leave? There's nothing
we need to talk about anymore!

00:20:17.424 --> 00:20:18.800
Come on, Bella!

00:20:18.884 --> 00:20:20.385
- Leave--
- You're coming with me!

00:20:20.469 --> 00:20:22.346
- Ow!
- We're going home, okay?!

00:20:22.429 --> 00:20:23.472
It hurts…

00:20:23.555 --> 00:20:26.141
Does your family
think they can keep you from me?

00:20:26.225 --> 00:20:29.019
At least my family doesn't hurt me.

00:20:29.561 --> 00:20:31.438
How are they going to hurt you?

00:20:31.521 --> 00:20:32.981
When they live so far away!

00:20:33.065 --> 00:20:35.400
Why is it my fault?

00:20:35.484 --> 00:20:37.277
And tell me.

00:20:37.361 --> 00:20:39.529
Tell me why we always reach the point

00:20:39.613 --> 00:20:42.115
- of hurting each other!
- Jerome, stop it!

00:20:42.199 --> 00:20:43.450
You're the problem!

00:20:43.533 --> 00:20:44.868
It's your fault…

00:20:44.952 --> 00:20:46.119
- Whatever--
- for making me angry!

00:20:46.203 --> 00:20:48.455
Whatever you say,
I'm not coming back to you!

00:20:48.538 --> 00:20:50.332
Don't you understand that, huh?!

00:20:53.585 --> 00:20:55.295
Looks like you've gotten braver!

00:20:55.379 --> 00:20:56.922
Why? You have a new boyfriend now?!

00:20:57.589 --> 00:20:59.091
You have someone else, don't you?!

00:21:07.641 --> 00:21:09.726
That's none of your business!

00:21:16.775 --> 00:21:18.277
- Miss Mia!
- What's your problem?!

00:21:18.652 --> 00:21:20.028
They say…

00:21:20.696 --> 00:21:23.448
only insecure men, hurt women.

00:21:23.532 --> 00:21:25.534
Stay out of our business.

00:21:25.617 --> 00:21:28.245
I want to know what you're insecure about.

00:21:29.371 --> 00:21:31.206
Is it because that thing

00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:33.500
in your pants is small?

00:21:36.044 --> 00:21:38.046
Or is it because you're trash?

00:21:39.923 --> 00:21:41.883
I told you to stay out of this.

00:21:41.967 --> 00:21:43.927
Miss Mia!

00:21:44.011 --> 00:21:45.470
Miss Mia! Help!

00:21:45.554 --> 00:21:47.806
People here are crazy
and you're one of them.

00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:57.316
Patrick!

00:21:57.399 --> 00:21:59.026
Patrick, hey! Stop it!

00:21:59.109 --> 00:22:01.153
Don't beat up the visitor!

00:22:17.336 --> 00:22:18.503
Patrick!

00:22:19.796 --> 00:22:21.048
Patpat!

00:22:21.131 --> 00:22:22.924
Stop punching him.

00:22:29.514 --> 00:22:32.309
It, it's wrong to hurt people, right?

00:22:32.392 --> 00:22:34.102
Don't hurt him.

00:23:17.646 --> 00:23:20.941
This is the second time you've had
an encounter in the hospital, Patrick,

00:23:21.024 --> 00:23:22.067
so I don't have a choice…

00:23:22.150 --> 00:23:25.612
I'm sorry. Am I
the reason you lost your job?

00:23:25.695 --> 00:23:27.614
You really did it for Mia.

00:23:29.116 --> 00:23:30.784
You said you'll leave everything behind

00:23:30.867 --> 00:23:33.495
if I ask you to run away with me.

00:23:33.578 --> 00:23:34.496
You mean…

00:23:34.579 --> 00:23:36.414
Shall we run away?

00:23:36.957 --> 00:23:39.000
We can't spend the night out.
I'm worried about Matmat.

00:23:39.084 --> 00:23:40.168
What?

00:23:40.252 --> 00:23:42.671
- Mia, what are you doing?
- I'll drive us off the road!

00:23:42.754 --> 00:23:44.214
Mia!
