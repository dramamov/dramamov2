00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:03.461
- Samuel's cancer has spread?
- Yes.

00:00:03.545 --> 00:00:06.381
It's not advisable for
him to undergo surgery.

00:00:06.464 --> 00:00:07.924
That's bad news.

00:00:08.008 --> 00:00:09.884
I'll be the one to tell Mia.

00:00:09.968 --> 00:00:13.430
If you don't add butterflies,
then you'll never get the job finished.

00:00:13.513 --> 00:00:16.016
And if you don't finish the job,
You won't get paid.

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:18.810
D-Doc Anok is a scammer.

00:00:18.893 --> 00:00:20.228
- M-Matmat quits.
- Matmat.

00:00:20.311 --> 00:00:22.147
I'm still talking to you.
Don't turn your back on me.

00:00:24.607 --> 00:00:26.609
Now, you know how I feel when you hit me!

00:00:26.693 --> 00:00:28.611
If you don't want
me to talk to you like this,

00:00:28.695 --> 00:00:30.780
then act like
a proper older brother to me!

00:00:30.864 --> 00:00:32.949
Y-You're shouting at me?

00:01:34.761 --> 00:01:36.805
{\an8}- Hey! Stop messing around.

00:01:36.888 --> 00:01:38.723
{\an8}I have to apply medicine.

00:01:39.891 --> 00:01:41.100
{\an8}

00:01:41.184 --> 00:01:42.602
{\an8}You find this funny, huh?

00:01:42.685 --> 00:01:44.604
{\an8}You've been beaten up,
and you're still laughing?

00:01:44.687 --> 00:01:45.688
{\an8}

00:01:47.482 --> 00:01:48.983
{\an8}

00:01:49.067 --> 00:01:50.693
{\an8}

00:01:50.777 --> 00:01:52.362
{\an8}Lord God.

00:01:52.445 --> 00:01:54.697
{\an8}Is this still Patrick with me?

00:01:54.781 --> 00:01:57.117
{\an8}I want my best friend back, please.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.201
{\an8}

00:01:59.577 --> 00:02:01.955
{\an8}Silly! You make
it seem like I'm being possessed.

00:02:02.038 --> 00:02:03.915
{\an8}Patrick? You're back!

00:02:03.998 --> 00:02:06.251
{\an8}My goodness! Welcome back!

00:02:06.334 --> 00:02:08.795
{\an8}Are you the same
friend I've known for years?

00:02:08.878 --> 00:02:12.590
{\an8}The one who would
just frown and not fight back

00:02:12.674 --> 00:02:14.467
{\an8}when his older brother hits him?

00:02:15.468 --> 00:02:17.095
{\an8}Of course, it's still me.

00:02:17.178 --> 00:02:20.056
{\an8}

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.558
{\an8}I just chose to fight back.

00:02:24.894 --> 00:02:27.063
{\an8}- Really?
Mm-hmm.

00:02:27.147 --> 00:02:30.483
{\an8}

00:02:31.401 --> 00:02:33.903
{\an8}I decided to choose myself this time.

00:02:37.073 --> 00:02:39.159
{\an8}Because Patpat…

00:02:39.242 --> 00:02:40.660
{\an8}only belongs to Patpat.

00:02:40.743 --> 00:02:43.037
{\an8}

00:02:43.121 --> 00:02:45.540
{\an8}That was like a boxing match.

00:02:45.623 --> 00:02:47.709
{\an8}I mean, Patrick even hurt you.

00:02:49.878 --> 00:02:51.963
{\an8}P-Patpat is mean.

00:02:52.046 --> 00:02:53.965
{\an8}I don't like Patpat anymore.

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.261
{\an8}Don't be like that, Matmat.

00:02:58.344 --> 00:03:01.806
{\an8}You and Patrick will be
okay later, so don't say that.

00:03:03.725 --> 00:03:05.226
{\an8}Where does it hurt? Oh.

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.311
{\an8}I don't like him.

00:03:07.812 --> 00:03:09.898
{\an8}I d-don't like Patpat anymore.

00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:15.153
P-Patpat is no longer my brother.

00:03:17.322 --> 00:03:18.740
Is that so?

00:03:18.823 --> 00:03:21.284
{\an8}

00:03:21.367 --> 00:03:22.869
{\an8}Are you sure about that?

00:03:23.202 --> 00:03:24.621
{\an8}Is that your final answer?

00:03:26.998 --> 00:03:28.333
Ye-Yes.

00:03:29.167 --> 00:03:30.460
I'm s--sure.

00:03:32.086 --> 00:03:34.631
If Patrick isn't your brother anymore,

00:03:35.215 --> 00:03:36.841
that means he has no family.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.594
He has no family?

00:03:39.677 --> 00:03:42.305
Poor Patpat.

00:03:42.388 --> 00:03:44.098
What should we do?

00:03:44.182 --> 00:03:46.935
What if I adopt Patrick?

00:03:47.018 --> 00:03:48.853
Is that okay with you, Matmat?

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.735
I don't like him.
I d-don't like Patpat anymore.

00:03:57.195 --> 00:03:59.030
I'm lucky then.

00:03:59.113 --> 00:04:01.449
Patrick will be my son now.

00:04:04.035 --> 00:04:05.245
Oh, Ma.

00:04:05.328 --> 00:04:06.996
You'll be like Mister Junior,

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.831
one of the characters
in Matmat's favorite show.

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:11.042
You have an adopted child now.

00:04:35.441 --> 00:04:36.734
"Are you still up?"

00:04:37.568 --> 00:04:38.861
"I'm hungry".

00:05:19.068 --> 00:05:21.988
You know it's always
just been me and Matmat, right?

00:05:22.864 --> 00:05:24.449
I've gotten used to just you two.

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.869
But I think…

00:05:30.538 --> 00:05:32.832
we need to broaden our world.

00:05:34.625 --> 00:05:36.419
You need to broaden your world.

00:05:38.254 --> 00:05:40.715
- Are you listening?
- Yes, I'm listening.

00:05:43.676 --> 00:05:44.677
Dude.

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:49.640
Out of everyone in
the world you can add into your life…

00:05:51.309 --> 00:05:52.310
why Mia?

00:05:53.144 --> 00:05:55.354
Why are you bringing up Mia?

00:05:55.438 --> 00:05:57.648
You said you wanted to broaden your world.

00:05:57.732 --> 00:06:00.818
That means you'll
have more people in your life.

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:05.156
- You have a point.
- So why her?

00:06:05.239 --> 00:06:07.075
There are several
other people in the world.

00:06:09.619 --> 00:06:12.413
Because Mia is
the loneliest person I know.

00:06:20.546 --> 00:06:22.298
So we'll start with her.

00:06:37.897 --> 00:06:40.191
You talked about your godfather

00:06:40.274 --> 00:06:42.110
- who has a fishpond?
- Mm-hmm.

00:06:42.193 --> 00:06:44.112
Seriously, Gemma Lyn Marie?!

00:06:44.195 --> 00:06:46.614
That was a date.
Why did you talk about that?

00:06:46.697 --> 00:06:49.659
Ma, it just came up
during our conversation.

00:06:49.742 --> 00:06:50.743
Okay?

00:06:50.827 --> 00:06:53.996
Our first topic was
about the time I got drunk.

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:55.790
Isn't that more embarrassing?

00:06:56.707 --> 00:06:58.626
Oh, Ma! There's more!

00:06:59.085 --> 00:07:02.130
He heard this music
and then started acting like a model

00:07:02.213 --> 00:07:04.132
flexing his muscles.

00:07:04.215 --> 00:07:07.343
- Oh. Do you hear that?

00:07:07.426 --> 00:07:08.427
Huh?

00:07:10.555 --> 00:07:11.597
Come on!

00:07:11.681 --> 00:07:12.890
Whoo!

00:07:12.974 --> 00:07:15.393
- Hey! Vincent, stop it.
- Whoo!

00:07:15.476 --> 00:07:16.978
- Vincent!
- Whoo!

00:07:17.061 --> 00:07:18.938
- Hey! Stop--
- Whoo!

00:07:19.021 --> 00:07:22.233
Vincent, stop it. Come on.

00:07:22.316 --> 00:07:24.235
- Join me. Whoo!
- It's embarrassing.

00:07:25.194 --> 00:07:26.863
I don't know this guy.

00:07:26.946 --> 00:07:28.531
- I don't.
- Yes, you do.

00:07:28.614 --> 00:07:30.032
We've been together the whole day.

00:07:30.116 --> 00:07:32.326
- Hey! Oh my god!
- You know what?

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:35.538
If you want to forget about something,

00:07:35.621 --> 00:07:37.415
you have to make new memories.

00:07:37.498 --> 00:07:41.335
We'll replace your memory
of the time you got drunk with…

00:07:41.419 --> 00:07:43.713
With how you're
embarrassing yourself. Come on.

00:07:43.796 --> 00:07:44.839
- Vincent.
- See?

00:07:44.922 --> 00:07:48.342
From now on, you'll remember the time…

00:07:50.052 --> 00:07:51.345
I made you smile.

00:07:52.597 --> 00:07:54.098
Right?

00:07:54.182 --> 00:07:56.392
So, come on. Join me.

00:08:01.105 --> 00:08:03.149
So, that's what happened.

00:08:03.232 --> 00:08:05.401
Vincent is really something, right?

00:08:08.154 --> 00:08:11.073
Ma, what are you smiling about?

00:08:11.157 --> 00:08:13.618
You're acting like Vincent.
He was all smiles earlier.

00:08:14.202 --> 00:08:15.661
- Dear.
- Hmm?

00:08:15.745 --> 00:08:18.664
It's the first time
you didn't mention Patrick.

00:08:19.248 --> 00:08:23.211
You keep talking about Vincent.

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:25.713
Geez, Ma.

00:08:26.547 --> 00:08:29.175
I'm just happy to see you

00:08:29.258 --> 00:08:32.345
finally starting to open your heart.

00:08:32.428 --> 00:08:34.889
That's a good start.

00:08:40.186 --> 00:08:41.354
"Seen"?

00:08:42.563 --> 00:08:45.608
Its not like he doesn't know
I can see he's read my message.

00:08:51.614 --> 00:08:53.950
Who the hell could that be?

00:09:54.927 --> 00:09:55.970
Ahh!

00:10:02.893 --> 00:10:05.396
Why are you smiling
while fighting someone with an umbrella?

00:10:05.479 --> 00:10:06.647
Because it's you.

00:10:06.731 --> 00:10:08.024
What if it wasn't me?

00:10:09.358 --> 00:10:12.278
Didn't I tell you not
to open your door for strangers?

00:10:12.737 --> 00:10:14.614
My instinct told me to open it.

00:10:14.697 --> 00:10:16.198
- Mia--
- I had a feeling it was you.

00:10:17.116 --> 00:10:18.159
Fine.

00:10:18.242 --> 00:10:19.910
I won't open my door again.

00:10:20.369 --> 00:10:21.871
Because next time,

00:10:21.954 --> 00:10:23.039
you'll already be here.

00:10:24.415 --> 00:10:26.042
Why are you here anyway?

00:10:26.626 --> 00:10:28.002
Didn't you invited me to eat with you?

00:10:29.045 --> 00:10:29.754
Yes.

00:10:29.837 --> 00:10:31.505
- Here's your order.
- Thank you.

00:10:32.173 --> 00:10:33.174
I'll do it.

00:10:40.306 --> 00:10:41.641
Now, it's perfect.

00:10:43.476 --> 00:10:45.311
You never get tired of this, do you?

00:10:50.941 --> 00:10:52.234
Just like how,

00:10:52.902 --> 00:10:55.738
you never get tired
of fighting with Matmat.

00:10:58.491 --> 00:11:02.078
Didn't you tell me
that I should earn Matmat's trust?

00:11:02.161 --> 00:11:04.163
That I should always be on his good side?

00:11:05.039 --> 00:11:08.042
But now, you're
the one who's fighting with him.

00:11:09.877 --> 00:11:12.338
When are you going
to reconcile with Matmat?

00:11:15.633 --> 00:11:16.717
I don't know yet.

00:11:17.218 --> 00:11:18.386
What?

00:11:18.469 --> 00:11:20.346
You won't even try to make amends?

00:11:22.765 --> 00:11:24.016
I'm still thinking about it.

00:11:29.021 --> 00:11:30.064
Patrick.

00:11:30.523 --> 00:11:32.983
Just tell Matmat that you like me.

00:11:55.756 --> 00:11:56.882
The truth is…

00:12:00.886 --> 00:12:02.304
I like Mia.

00:12:10.146 --> 00:12:11.772
I wonder what his reaction will be.

00:12:15.901 --> 00:12:17.194
There you go again,

00:12:17.987 --> 00:12:19.655
worrying about other people.

00:12:20.614 --> 00:12:21.991
My point is…

00:12:22.992 --> 00:12:25.077
When are you going
to think about yourself?

00:12:25.703 --> 00:12:27.288
To take care of yourself?

00:12:28.664 --> 00:12:30.082
Fulfill your dreams?

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:32.960
If you don't have any dreams right now,

00:12:33.043 --> 00:12:34.587
then make new ones.

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:39.008
I have dreams.

00:12:42.136 --> 00:12:44.847
Come on, tell me your dreams,

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:46.474
I will make them happen.

00:12:48.309 --> 00:12:49.602
I have three dreams.

00:12:50.561 --> 00:12:51.979
But two of those,

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:53.606
have already been fulfilled.

00:12:54.148 --> 00:12:55.107
Like what?

00:12:57.151 --> 00:12:58.360
Travel.

00:12:59.945 --> 00:13:01.697
Montanesa vacation.

00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:02.615
Check.

00:13:04.366 --> 00:13:06.452
Second, to have a fight with Matmat.

00:13:06.535 --> 00:13:08.078
You two always fight.

00:13:08.162 --> 00:13:10.372
I mean, a fight where
he's not the only one attacking,

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:13.083
but I'm fighting back, too.

00:13:14.418 --> 00:13:17.588
That dream is kind of weird,
but okay. Check.

00:13:17.671 --> 00:13:19.757
Jason said I had lost my mind.

00:13:20.341 --> 00:13:24.094
It had always been
a dream of mine for us to fight

00:13:24.678 --> 00:13:26.430
like normal siblings do.

00:13:33.729 --> 00:13:34.855
What's the last one?

00:13:36.232 --> 00:13:37.233
Come on, tell me.

00:13:38.275 --> 00:13:39.735
I will make it happen.

00:13:42.696 --> 00:13:44.114
It's impossible.

00:13:44.823 --> 00:13:46.825
Just tell me, and I will make it happen.

00:13:48.077 --> 00:13:49.828
It's not something you can fulfill.

00:13:58.295 --> 00:14:00.172
Patpat, come down here.

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:02.132
Patrick.

00:14:02.216 --> 00:14:03.634
Hey, Patrick!

00:14:03.717 --> 00:14:05.469
Patrick, what are you doing?

00:14:05.553 --> 00:14:07.012
We're losing because of you!

00:14:07.096 --> 00:14:08.347
What are you doing? We can't--

00:14:09.557 --> 00:14:10.558
Ahh.

00:14:11.058 --> 00:14:12.476
No wonder you're distracted.

00:14:12.851 --> 00:14:15.062
Come on, let's win the next round.

00:14:15.145 --> 00:14:16.230
I don't want my money to go to waste.

00:14:17.606 --> 00:14:20.526
Come on, Patrick,
let's play another round.

00:14:21.902 --> 00:14:23.237
Hey!

00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:24.321
Bro!

00:14:25.155 --> 00:14:26.866
If you leave, you have to pay me double.

00:14:26.949 --> 00:14:28.033
- Hey!
- Okay, I will.

00:14:28.117 --> 00:14:29.660
Come on, bro.

00:14:29.743 --> 00:14:30.786
Let's win the next round.

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:32.079
I'll make it up to you tomorrow.

00:14:32.162 --> 00:14:34.123
Tomorrow? Hey, don't leave me here.

00:14:34.874 --> 00:14:35.875
Patrick!

00:14:37.042 --> 00:14:38.127
Bro!

00:14:42.339 --> 00:14:44.091
Can I please order some…

00:14:44.174 --> 00:14:45.593
Singapore noodles?

00:14:47.845 --> 00:14:49.763
I'm going to sit over there.

00:14:49.847 --> 00:14:50.931
Okay, ma'am. Thank you.

00:14:51.015 --> 00:14:52.016
Thank you.

00:14:54.768 --> 00:14:56.353
Uh… Mia.

00:15:00.274 --> 00:15:01.442
Uh…

00:15:05.154 --> 00:15:06.155
Uh…

00:15:10.618 --> 00:15:12.494
- Pat!
- Matmat.

00:15:12.578 --> 00:15:15.205
Smells like someone's been hanging out
at an internet café all day.

00:15:15.289 --> 00:15:16.582
Here's what you asked me to buy.

00:15:16.665 --> 00:15:18.000
You weren't answering my call,
so I just bought

00:15:18.083 --> 00:15:19.668
- size small briefs for you.
- Matmat!

00:15:21.211 --> 00:15:22.463
Oh, sorry.

00:15:22.546 --> 00:15:24.757
Size small when
you were young, but size large now.

00:15:25.382 --> 00:15:26.300
You blew my chance!

00:15:27.009 --> 00:15:28.719
I corrected myself and
said you wear size large now.

00:15:28.802 --> 00:15:30.512
I've been wearing
size large for a long time.

00:15:30.596 --> 00:15:32.598
She already moved on, so let's just go.

00:15:32.681 --> 00:15:34.683
No, wait. Miss! Miss!

00:15:34.767 --> 00:15:36.644
- You with short hair!
- Hey, it's embarrassing!

00:15:36.727 --> 00:15:38.270
My brother thinks
you look pretty in your uniform!

00:15:38.354 --> 00:15:39.355
She's looking at us.

00:15:39.438 --> 00:15:40.814
Come on, let's go closer.

00:15:40.898 --> 00:15:41.607
Miss.

00:15:45.486 --> 00:15:48.489
I'm sorry for mentioning
my brother's size small briefs--

00:15:48.572 --> 00:15:49.740
- Hey!
- Oh, sorry!

00:15:49.823 --> 00:15:51.492
I mean, I'm sorry for
interrupting your conversation.

00:15:51.575 --> 00:15:55.037
My handsome brother
wants to continue talking to you.

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:56.163
Go on.

00:15:56.246 --> 00:15:58.707
This is your second
chance, so do your best.

00:15:58.791 --> 00:16:00.000
She's already looking at you.

00:16:00.084 --> 00:16:01.710
There's no turning back now.

00:16:07.383 --> 00:16:09.259
By the way, I'm…

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:10.844
Patrick.

00:16:12.304 --> 00:16:13.305
I know you.

00:16:13.973 --> 00:16:15.432
You're Patrick…

00:16:16.433 --> 00:16:18.185
Gonzales, right?

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:19.937
You're from the other section.

00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:24.608
Go, go, go.

00:16:56.265 --> 00:16:57.474
Matmat.

00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:02.604
The truth is…

00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:04.690
Hmm, Patpat?

00:17:06.233 --> 00:17:07.443
The truth is…

00:17:09.737 --> 00:17:11.196
I like her.

00:17:16.326 --> 00:17:19.580
P-Patpat likes someone?

00:17:32.426 --> 00:17:35.721
Patpat is smiling?

00:18:28.232 --> 00:18:32.653
P-Patpat is… happy?

00:18:58.387 --> 00:19:01.306
T-This is the first time…

00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:06.270
I've seen Patpat happy.

00:19:11.066 --> 00:19:12.568
Mia!

00:19:12.651 --> 00:19:13.735
Mia?

00:19:14.361 --> 00:19:15.362
Mia!

00:19:17.072 --> 00:19:18.031
Mia.

00:19:18.115 --> 00:19:19.783
Oh, there she is!

00:19:19.867 --> 00:19:22.744
My favorite writer in the world!

00:19:24.246 --> 00:19:25.455
Boss V…

00:19:26.165 --> 00:19:28.250
I want to go back to Mama Li's house.

00:19:28.333 --> 00:19:30.669
I can't sleep here.

00:19:30.752 --> 00:19:33.839
Madeth, are you my
favorite writer in the world?

00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:35.799
- Huh?
- No.

00:19:35.883 --> 00:19:39.636
No, right? So,
that means I'm not talking to you.

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:40.929
Okay?

00:19:41.513 --> 00:19:42.431
Mia.

00:19:42.514 --> 00:19:43.932
Oh, Mia!

00:19:44.016 --> 00:19:46.977
You look so serious
typing on your laptop.

00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:48.562
You look so beautiful.

00:19:48.645 --> 00:19:49.646
Very cute.

00:19:50.314 --> 00:19:53.317
So, what's the title
of our next bestseller?

00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:57.070
We don't have one yet.

00:19:57.154 --> 00:19:58.864
Okay, fine. Um…

00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:01.200
Draft? Have you a first draft?

00:20:01.283 --> 00:20:02.451
No.

00:20:03.535 --> 00:20:05.579
How about an outline?

00:20:05.662 --> 00:20:06.663
No.

00:20:08.999 --> 00:20:11.168
Concept? Surely, you've thought of one.

00:20:11.877 --> 00:20:13.670
Can we hear it?

00:20:18.634 --> 00:20:20.260
Okay, okay, uh…

00:20:21.303 --> 00:20:24.181
So there are three
silhouettes of people riding a van.

00:20:25.933 --> 00:20:27.184
What's it about?

00:20:27.267 --> 00:20:29.353
Nothing's finalized.

00:20:29.436 --> 00:20:32.022
But this is going to be fun.

00:20:33.023 --> 00:20:35.442
Mia, give me something!

00:20:35.525 --> 00:20:37.110
Come on!

00:20:38.487 --> 00:20:39.488
Hey.

00:20:40.155 --> 00:20:41.406
Fine! Fine!

00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:44.243
I'll talk to Rose.
She'll be your illustrator.

00:20:44.701 --> 00:20:47.120
Who said I want a new illustrator?

00:20:50.999 --> 00:20:52.167
Um…

00:20:52.251 --> 00:20:56.255
Miss Mia, is Matmat
still doing the illustrations?

00:20:56.338 --> 00:20:57.339
Yes.

00:20:58.966 --> 00:21:00.717
I thought you and Matmat
weren't on good terms.

00:21:01.134 --> 00:21:02.302
Nothing will change.

00:21:02.386 --> 00:21:04.304
He's still my illustrator.

00:21:34.334 --> 00:21:35.460
Matmat?

00:21:36.295 --> 00:21:37.254
Patpat?

00:21:37.587 --> 00:21:38.839
Have you eaten?

00:21:38.922 --> 00:21:40.757
Not yet.

00:21:40.841 --> 00:21:46.013
It's almost time to clock off
and you haven't eaten lunch?

00:21:47.723 --> 00:21:49.725
Well, I snacked on some bread earlier.

00:21:49.808 --> 00:21:52.686
And besides, I'd rather just eat at home.

00:21:54.146 --> 00:21:55.856
M-Mensa.

00:21:58.066 --> 00:21:59.401
The restaurant?

00:21:59.985 --> 00:22:03.905
Let's eat there after work.

00:22:05.907 --> 00:22:09.077
Okay. My shift just ended.
I'll just change.

00:22:09.536 --> 00:22:10.662
I'll see you there.

00:22:11.913 --> 00:22:13.206
Okay.

00:22:16.168 --> 00:22:17.586
Post on her account

00:22:17.669 --> 00:22:22.841
with the caption,
"My next heartwarming story. Soon!"

00:22:22.924 --> 00:22:25.719
My stories aren't heartwarming.

00:22:28.263 --> 00:22:30.015
Change it to heartbreaking.

00:22:30.098 --> 00:22:33.602
Go. Take more
pictures from different angles.

00:22:44.946 --> 00:22:46.406
By the way, Mia…

00:22:47.324 --> 00:22:48.784
OK Hospital called.

00:22:48.867 --> 00:22:49.910
It's about your father.

00:22:56.374 --> 00:22:58.126
They said he can no
longer undergo surgery

00:22:58.210 --> 00:23:00.045
because of the tumor in his brain.

00:23:03.548 --> 00:23:05.050
Tumor or not,

00:23:05.675 --> 00:23:07.511
my father is already dead to me.

00:23:09.262 --> 00:23:10.889
Mia, he's your only family left.

00:23:10.972 --> 00:23:12.265
I've long been an orphan.

00:23:12.891 --> 00:23:14.392
You know this, Vincent.

00:23:15.102 --> 00:23:16.853
I no longer have family.

00:23:22.275 --> 00:23:24.027
- Maybe you could call--
- Leave.

00:23:26.363 --> 00:23:28.490
- But, Mia--
- I said leave.

00:24:32.262 --> 00:24:33.096
Mia?

00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:34.347
Let's go out.

00:24:36.558 --> 00:24:38.351
I can't today.

00:24:39.019 --> 00:24:40.103
Why not?

00:24:41.813 --> 00:24:44.983
Matmat asked to hang out.
That doesn't happen often, so I would.

00:24:45.066 --> 00:24:46.401
I'll go with you.

00:24:47.694 --> 00:24:49.487
Let me come with you. Please.

00:24:58.413 --> 00:25:00.832
If I give some away,
you might take everything.

00:25:00.916 --> 00:25:03.293
Patpat only belongs to Patpat.

00:25:03.919 --> 00:25:05.295
Patpat is happy?

00:25:06.213 --> 00:25:07.505
Is this for your book?

00:25:07.589 --> 00:25:08.548
Mm-hmm.

00:25:08.632 --> 00:25:10.258
Out of all the books I've written,

00:25:10.342 --> 00:25:13.136
- I really want this one to get published.
- Why?

00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:15.764
Because it's inspired by the three of us.
You, me, and Matmat.

00:25:15.847 --> 00:25:17.307
Happy day!

00:25:17.390 --> 00:25:18.225
Hi, Matmat.

00:25:18.308 --> 00:25:20.518
Patpat, what is she doing here?

00:25:20.602 --> 00:25:22.270
Matmat, come on! I want siblings too!

00:25:22.354 --> 00:25:24.564
I want a brother like you!

00:25:24.648 --> 00:25:29.152
Sometimes, we have to do things
to find inspiration.

00:25:29.236 --> 00:25:32.948
My heart is big enough to share my love.

00:25:33.031 --> 00:25:36.534
For Matmat and for you.

00:25:36.618 --> 00:25:37.786
Face your fears.

00:25:37.869 --> 00:25:41.289
Patrick's been affected
by your phobia of butterflies.

00:25:41.373 --> 00:25:43.166
Patpat's affected?

00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:47.003
Are you afraid of
butterflies too, Patpat?

00:25:47.087 --> 00:25:48.922
There's someone out there

00:25:49.005 --> 00:25:51.132
who wants to harm Samuel and Mia.

00:25:51.216 --> 00:25:55.053
He thought I was Ingrid!
He wanted to kill me!
