WEBVTT

00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:02.085
Patrick!

00:00:02.168 --> 00:00:03.253
What happened?

00:00:03.336 --> 00:00:05.839
I just found him like this.
And look at this.

00:00:05.922 --> 00:00:06.923
This is a sedative.

00:00:07.007 --> 00:00:08.591
Patient Zelda…

00:00:08.675 --> 00:00:11.302
She said this is
an important day for her.

00:00:12.721 --> 00:00:14.180
Patrick?

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:18.184
Happy birthday, my dear daughter.

00:00:18.268 --> 00:00:19.644
Ingrid.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.479
You're here.

00:00:21.563 --> 00:00:22.856
Who's the celebrant?

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:24.149
My child.

00:00:25.275 --> 00:00:26.735
No one should know about this.

00:00:26.818 --> 00:00:28.570
No! Ahh!

00:00:28.653 --> 00:00:30.530
On the day of your birthday,

00:00:30.613 --> 00:00:32.741
that's what he thought of doing…

00:00:32.824 --> 00:00:34.242
killing you.

00:00:34.325 --> 00:00:35.827
Why are you doing this?

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.538
Because why not?

00:01:49.818 --> 00:01:50.860
Mia?

00:01:52.946 --> 00:01:54.030
Mia!

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:56.533
Mia!

00:01:59.994 --> 00:02:01.955
Mia?! Mia?!

00:02:15.718 --> 00:02:17.637
Mia?! Mia?!

00:03:01.264 --> 00:03:02.807
Are you okay? Huh?

00:03:08.271 --> 00:03:10.356
Who did this to you? Huh?

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.275
Was it Zelda?

00:03:13.192 --> 00:03:14.485
Did she come here?

00:03:15.194 --> 00:03:16.279
Yeah.

00:03:17.614 --> 00:03:19.032
Where is Zelda?

00:03:19.657 --> 00:03:21.200
I took care of it.

00:03:22.035 --> 00:03:23.369
I'm fine.

00:03:26.581 --> 00:03:32.295
{\an8}

00:03:33.588 --> 00:03:35.298
{\an8}

00:03:35.381 --> 00:03:40.595
{\an8}
I'm happy we got to meet, Mia.

00:03:41.846 --> 00:03:43.723
{\an8}

00:03:45.558 --> 00:03:50.897
{\an8}

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.485
{\an8}

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:02.158
{\an8}-

00:04:02.867 --> 00:04:04.744
{\an8}-
Where is Zelda?

00:04:05.495 --> 00:04:06.788
{\an8}She's gone.

00:04:07.288 --> 00:04:10.208
{\an8}If you think I did something bad to her,

00:04:11.125 --> 00:04:14.003
{\an8}I didn't. She just left.

00:04:15.046 --> 00:04:17.674
{\an8}Okay, don't go outside.
I'll try to catch up to her.

00:04:17.757 --> 00:04:18.967
{\an8}Patrick.

00:04:19.592 --> 00:04:22.637
{\an8}

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.764
{\an8}Did you come here for her?

00:04:27.809 --> 00:04:29.894
{\an8}Are you here because of your patient…

00:04:31.187 --> 00:04:32.689
{\an8}and not because of me?

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.024
{\an8}Mia…

00:04:36.567 --> 00:04:37.652
{\an8}

00:04:40.613 --> 00:04:42.991
{\an8}You didn't reply to any of my messages.

00:04:44.075 --> 00:04:46.119
{\an8}You always make me feel like…

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:49.998
{\an8}I come second, Matmat is your priority.

00:04:51.374 --> 00:04:52.709
{\an8}And now…

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:56.045
{\an8}You're here…

00:04:56.587 --> 00:05:00.508
{\an8}

00:05:00.591 --> 00:05:03.303
{\an8}but you're more concerned
about your own patient.

00:05:05.221 --> 00:05:07.515
{\an8}Mia, it's not like that.
I was worried about you too.

00:05:07.598 --> 00:05:09.183
{\an8}That's exactly what it's like, Patrick.

00:05:12.312 --> 00:05:14.772
{\an8}Once you leave here and find her,

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.900
{\an8}you're going to take
her back to the hospital.

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.362
{\an8}Just like what you did to Junjun and Kai.

00:05:23.323 --> 00:05:25.199
{\an8}Once you've taken care of them,

00:05:27.535 --> 00:05:29.120
you're going to check on Matmat.

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:35.168
Because that's what you always do.

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:39.130
And then you'll come back to me.

00:05:41.132 --> 00:05:42.967
Mia, that's not…

00:05:43.342 --> 00:05:44.635
It's like that.

00:05:47.013 --> 00:05:49.098
You'll always put them…

00:05:50.475 --> 00:05:51.476
before me.

00:06:04.781 --> 00:06:06.574
Why did he hug me…

00:06:07.408 --> 00:06:09.952
if he didn't come here for me?

00:06:15.583 --> 00:06:19.045
He was all I was thinking of
while talking to that woman.

00:06:21.297 --> 00:06:23.341
Oops.

00:06:23.424 --> 00:06:25.343
I hurt you.

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:27.804
What are you going to do to me?

00:06:29.597 --> 00:06:31.349
If you feel yourself losing control,

00:06:31.432 --> 00:06:33.059
try counting to three.

00:06:38.648 --> 00:06:39.816
One.

00:06:40.483 --> 00:06:42.026
Does it hurt?

00:06:43.194 --> 00:06:44.570
Two.

00:06:44.654 --> 00:06:46.989
You're bleeding, Mia.

00:06:48.866 --> 00:06:50.368
Three.

00:06:54.539 --> 00:06:56.999
You want this, right?

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:03.131
For the last time…

00:07:04.966 --> 00:07:06.175
Leave.

00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:12.473
Huh…

00:07:54.098 --> 00:07:57.018
It's so unfair.

00:07:58.728 --> 00:08:00.897
Mia?

00:08:21.125 --> 00:08:22.502
Mia.

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:25.129
Let's talk.

00:08:53.699 --> 00:08:57.036
You probably
thought I forgot, didn't you?

00:09:05.127 --> 00:09:06.796
Have they found her?

00:09:06.879 --> 00:09:10.132
Yeah, security said
they last saw her at Ventura Street.

00:09:10.216 --> 00:09:13.803
We asked the neighboring
town for assistance and CCTV footage.

00:09:13.886 --> 00:09:15.805
Ventura Street?

00:09:15.888 --> 00:09:17.974
What could she possibly
be doing over there?

00:09:19.684 --> 00:09:21.727
She's at Mia's house.

00:09:23.354 --> 00:09:24.981
Patrick called.

00:09:25.773 --> 00:09:28.192
Mia said Zelda was there.

00:09:28.651 --> 00:09:30.528
Should we call an ambulance?

00:09:30.945 --> 00:09:32.822
There's no need. She isn't there anymore.

00:09:32.905 --> 00:09:35.700
Gemma, please update the police.

00:09:35.783 --> 00:09:38.661
Tell them to start searching
for Zelda around where Mia's lives.

00:09:38.744 --> 00:09:40.580
- Okay, doc.
- Maybe she hasn't gone far.

00:09:40.663 --> 00:09:44.500
I'll tell our security
to keep monitoring our area.

00:09:44.875 --> 00:09:46.419
Nurse, I'll do it.

00:09:46.502 --> 00:09:47.545
Jun!

00:09:48.087 --> 00:09:49.171
Uh--

00:09:49.255 --> 00:09:51.382
I mean Pogi.

00:09:51.465 --> 00:09:52.717
Let Patty handle this.

00:09:53.509 --> 00:09:55.094
How are you feeling? You good?

00:09:55.845 --> 00:09:57.096
Doc, I'm fine.

00:09:58.014 --> 00:10:00.433
But, I was hoping I could
request leave for tomorrow.

00:10:00.516 --> 00:10:02.059
I got injured during work hours.

00:10:02.602 --> 00:10:04.353
I don't feel fully recovered yet.

00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:07.648
I'll approve it.
Since you also got a sedative shot.

00:10:07.732 --> 00:10:09.275
You can skip work.

00:10:09.358 --> 00:10:11.777
And the next day too.

00:10:11.861 --> 00:10:13.779
Then come to work at all

00:10:13.863 --> 00:10:16.782
so I can find a new nurse
to replace you in this hospital.

00:10:23.456 --> 00:10:24.999
Was that a joke?

00:10:25.583 --> 00:10:28.419
Ma'am, I'll prepare
Zelda's stuff for her return.

00:10:30.504 --> 00:10:32.089
Nurse, you said you had somewhere to be?

00:10:32.173 --> 00:10:34.550
If you want, I can instruct Patty myself.

00:10:34.634 --> 00:10:36.344
It's okay, doc. I'll do it.

00:10:36.427 --> 00:10:38.137
Zelda is my patient.

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:41.057
I need to stay
and oversee her safe return.

00:10:41.599 --> 00:10:44.310
Okay then. It just seems like
you're going somewhere special.

00:10:44.727 --> 00:10:46.729
I can do it some other time.

00:10:46.812 --> 00:10:47.855
Okay.

00:11:01.452 --> 00:11:03.204
We need to dress your wound.

00:11:05.206 --> 00:11:07.500
No one asked you to.

00:11:09.043 --> 00:11:10.628
It doesn't even hurt.

00:11:22.848 --> 00:11:24.392
We need to stop this, Patrick.

00:11:25.518 --> 00:11:28.437
Stop holding on to what we had.

00:11:28.521 --> 00:11:30.773
This ends right here.

00:11:30.856 --> 00:11:31.899
Now.

00:11:35.403 --> 00:11:37.238
That's what you told me.

00:11:38.489 --> 00:11:40.074
Those words hurt,

00:11:40.157 --> 00:11:41.242
more than this.

00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:48.082
Why are you acting like this?

00:11:48.999 --> 00:11:51.085
I told you that it's my birthday.

00:11:52.002 --> 00:11:54.004
I want to be with you.

00:11:54.463 --> 00:11:56.674
If you feel like
you can't control yourself,

00:11:58.134 --> 00:11:59.677
count up to three.

00:12:04.098 --> 00:12:05.057
One.

00:12:07.643 --> 00:12:08.644
Two.

00:12:12.106 --> 00:12:13.357
- Three.
- Three.

00:12:56.817 --> 00:12:57.818
Ma?

00:12:58.611 --> 00:13:02.448

Yay!

00:13:17.671 --> 00:13:18.714
Thank you, Ma.

00:13:19.256 --> 00:13:20.633
I thought you forgot.

00:13:21.717 --> 00:13:24.345
A mother will never forget

00:13:24.428 --> 00:13:27.264
the day she gave birth to her child.

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:31.268
Oh!

00:13:32.853 --> 00:13:34.104
My son.

00:13:35.814 --> 00:13:37.274
You're a grown man now.

00:13:56.794 --> 00:13:58.337
Ah, okay.

00:13:58.420 --> 00:13:59.880
I'll close it.

00:14:01.173 --> 00:14:02.383
Okay.

00:14:03.175 --> 00:14:04.593
Be careful.

00:14:07.763 --> 00:14:09.431
It's already dark.

00:14:09.515 --> 00:14:10.891
What are you two planning?

00:14:10.975 --> 00:14:12.935
Uh, Uncle Tommy is hungry.

00:14:13.018 --> 00:14:14.311
I'm going with him to Mess Hall.

00:14:14.979 --> 00:14:15.980
Okay.

00:14:16.063 --> 00:14:17.940
Chen, please go with them.

00:14:42.006 --> 00:14:43.132
Samuel…

00:14:43.841 --> 00:14:45.509
Aren't you tired yet?

00:14:50.055 --> 00:14:52.683
I was about to go to the chapel.

00:14:52.766 --> 00:14:55.352
To light up a candle for her.

00:14:56.604 --> 00:14:58.772
But there has been an emergency here.

00:15:00.399 --> 00:15:03.652
If you want,
we can sing her a happy birthday.

Samuel!

00:15:29.011 --> 00:15:30.638
Hold on! I'll call for some help!

00:15:30.721 --> 00:15:36.143
- Ahh!
- Nurse! Nurse!

00:15:38.395 --> 00:15:43.192

Aah! Who are you!

What do you want from me?!

00:16:50.718 --> 00:16:54.430
What do you want from me?!
What do you want from me?!

00:17:02.104 --> 00:17:05.024
No, no! Don't! Please don't!

00:17:05.107 --> 00:17:08.068
Aah!

00:17:32.468 --> 00:17:34.094
Please don't!

00:17:50.736 --> 00:17:51.904
Happy birthday.

00:17:55.365 --> 00:17:57.618
Best birthday gift ever.

00:17:58.994 --> 00:18:00.329
If I may say.

00:18:03.665 --> 00:18:04.958
I missed you.

00:18:10.839 --> 00:18:11.882
Hmm?

00:18:12.549 --> 00:18:13.675
You're blushing.

00:18:17.513 --> 00:18:20.182
It suddenly feels warm in here.

00:18:25.437 --> 00:18:26.855
You too.

00:18:27.189 --> 00:18:28.565
You're all red.

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:31.693
Am I?

00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:34.822
Do I feel hot?

00:18:35.405 --> 00:18:36.824
I know you're hot.

00:18:40.410 --> 00:18:41.787
Oh, you do feel hot.

00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:44.790
Do you have a fever?

00:18:47.084 --> 00:18:48.085
Are you sick?

00:18:48.168 --> 00:18:49.253
Yes.

00:18:52.506 --> 00:18:53.841
So you're really sick.

00:19:05.519 --> 00:19:06.645
Matmat!

00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:10.232
Matmat, I'm here!

00:19:11.483 --> 00:19:12.484
Hello.

00:19:13.193 --> 00:19:15.696
Oh, you're just
having dinner now, Matmat?

00:19:16.989 --> 00:19:22.703
I-I was waiting for
Patpat so we could eat together.

00:19:23.078 --> 00:19:24.121
But,

00:19:24.496 --> 00:19:27.166
he said there was
an emergency at the hospital.

00:19:27.249 --> 00:19:29.084
Someone escaped.

00:19:29.168 --> 00:19:32.004
Yeah, Matmat,
he also told me that earlier.

00:19:32.087 --> 00:19:33.672
That's why I came here.

00:19:34.882 --> 00:19:36.466
- Okay.
- Okay!

00:19:37.342 --> 00:19:38.594
Alright. Okay.

00:19:42.639 --> 00:19:45.809
Matmat, that looks so good.

00:19:45.893 --> 00:19:47.102
Can I have some?

00:19:47.186 --> 00:19:48.562
No.

00:19:49.271 --> 00:19:51.023
You always want

00:19:52.107 --> 00:19:54.359
to take Matmat's food.

00:19:54.735 --> 00:19:56.737
You're so unfair to me, Matmat.

00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:59.364
Just one bite, come on, ahh.

00:19:59.448 --> 00:20:00.532
No!

00:20:00.616 --> 00:20:03.327
Make your own food.

00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:05.287
You're so mean to me, Matmat.

00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:06.830
I just want to taste it.

00:20:06.914 --> 00:20:08.415
Didn't I teach you how to share?

00:20:12.211 --> 00:20:13.295
No.

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:18.217
If I give you some…

00:20:19.885 --> 00:20:21.303
you might take it all.

00:20:24.097 --> 00:20:26.725
I don't want to lose everything, Jason.

00:20:35.275 --> 00:20:36.443
Patrick?

00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:39.571
Patrick.

00:20:41.531 --> 00:20:43.242
Patrick, come on.

00:20:43.742 --> 00:20:44.868
Clothes off.

00:20:47.579 --> 00:20:48.997
- Take them off.
- No…

00:20:49.081 --> 00:20:51.541
You need to take off
your clothes so you can bathe.

00:20:52.125 --> 00:20:53.752
You need to bring your fever down,

00:20:53.835 --> 00:20:56.380
so come on, take them off.

00:20:59.675 --> 00:21:01.551
Patrick, I prepared everything.

00:21:02.344 --> 00:21:05.514
The bath, soap,
I even lit candles for you.

00:21:06.056 --> 00:21:08.058
Do you want me to add rose petals too?

00:21:08.141 --> 00:21:09.434
I don't need that.

00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:13.188
I know you need medicine.

00:21:13.272 --> 00:21:16.108
But come on, this will help you--

00:21:20.988 --> 00:21:22.239
This.

00:21:23.657 --> 00:21:25.200
This is what I need.

00:21:28.954 --> 00:21:30.998
Even if you're a medical worker,

00:21:32.249 --> 00:21:34.751
you believe this will heal you?

00:21:37.546 --> 00:21:39.631
It'll make me feel better.

00:21:47.723 --> 00:21:50.475
Here,
I'll treat you to ice cream.

00:21:50.559 --> 00:21:52.811
Because I know how to share.

00:21:52.894 --> 00:21:55.188
Because I'm not selfish,
that's how it should be.

00:21:55.897 --> 00:21:56.898
Oh.

00:21:57.816 --> 00:21:58.817
Huh?

00:21:59.359 --> 00:22:00.360
What's this?

00:22:00.444 --> 00:22:02.070
Matmat, is this yours?

00:22:02.154 --> 00:22:03.113
What is this?

00:22:03.739 --> 00:22:06.533
That's… that's Satsat.

00:22:06.616 --> 00:22:09.619
Satsat? Why, is it talkative?

00:22:12.831 --> 00:22:15.250
Satsat is our brother.

00:22:15.959 --> 00:22:17.127
Matmat,

00:22:18.003 --> 00:22:19.755
Patpat, Satsat.

00:22:20.672 --> 00:22:23.342
Matmat, that hurts my feelings.

00:22:23.425 --> 00:22:25.469
That rag is your brother?

00:22:26.094 --> 00:22:29.931
I go with you all over the Philippines.

00:22:30.015 --> 00:22:31.641
Am I not allowed to be.

00:22:32.059 --> 00:22:34.227
Jayjay? Sonson?

00:22:34.853 --> 00:22:39.733
Satsat is our brother
because he's a Gonzales,

00:22:39.816 --> 00:22:42.152
you're a Galang.

00:22:42.235 --> 00:22:44.488
Okay, how about this?

00:22:44.571 --> 00:22:49.493
Nowadays, anyone can be your brother

00:22:49.576 --> 00:22:51.328
as long as you share a solid bond.

00:22:51.411 --> 00:22:53.705
Like us, we're solid, right?

00:22:53.789 --> 00:22:56.792
J-Just the blood-related ones,

00:22:56.875 --> 00:22:59.252
like us siblings,

00:23:00.378 --> 00:23:03.381
are considered family to me and Patpat.

00:23:04.424 --> 00:23:06.635
Oh, Matmat. You don't want to share food.

00:23:06.718 --> 00:23:09.930
You don't want to share your brother.
Where do I stand?

00:23:10.013 --> 00:23:11.932
What? When do I get to win?

00:23:12.015 --> 00:23:14.101
Hey! Hey, Matmat!

00:23:14.184 --> 00:23:15.310
I'm still talking to you.

00:23:15.393 --> 00:23:18.980
You said you're
going to buy me ice cream.

00:23:21.316 --> 00:23:23.401
Yes, I will. Wait for me.

00:23:30.075 --> 00:23:33.161
Is it true
that Zelda almost died earlier?

00:23:36.289 --> 00:23:38.083
Did my Papa strangle her?

00:23:42.754 --> 00:23:44.172
Don't worry about it.

00:24:33.471 --> 00:24:37.893
No, no! Don't! Please don't!

00:24:37.976 --> 00:24:40.437
What are you going to do?!

00:24:41.313 --> 00:24:44.065
I don't even know you!
I didn't do anything to you!

00:24:44.149 --> 00:24:45.942
- You don't know who I am?!
- Aah!

00:24:46.026 --> 00:24:47.277
Look at this scar!

00:24:47.694 --> 00:24:49.487
You did this to me!

00:24:49.571 --> 00:24:51.323
You did!

00:24:51.406 --> 00:24:53.533
I don't know what you're talking about!

00:24:53.617 --> 00:24:55.285
Stop it, Ingrid!

00:24:58.246 --> 00:24:59.247
Ingrid?

00:25:02.042 --> 00:25:03.668
You're wrong.

00:25:03.752 --> 00:25:04.961
I'm not--

00:25:05.045 --> 00:25:07.214
I'm not Ingrid.

00:25:07.797 --> 00:25:09.966
You think you're fooling me, huh?

00:25:10.675 --> 00:25:14.095
Believe me!
I don't know what you're talking about!

00:25:14.179 --> 00:25:17.182
Everyone thought you were already dead!

00:25:17.265 --> 00:25:19.976
I'm the only one
who saw you rise from the lake!

00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:22.896
I'm the only one
who knows you're still alive, Ingrid.

00:25:22.979 --> 00:25:25.899
- Just me!
- I'm not Ingrid!

00:25:25.982 --> 00:25:27.943
- Enough!
- Aah!

00:25:28.026 --> 00:25:30.195
This is my chance to get back at you!

00:25:30.278 --> 00:25:35.700
I waited a long time for
the day that I could finally kill you!

00:25:35.784 --> 00:25:37.202
Aah!

00:25:37.285 --> 00:25:41.289
I'm not! I'm not Ingrid!

00:25:41.373 --> 00:25:43.541
I'm her fan! Just her fan!

00:25:43.625 --> 00:25:45.627
A stalker! I'm just a fan!

00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:47.254
My name is Zelda!

00:25:47.337 --> 00:25:49.381
You're really going
to keep on lying, huh?

00:25:49.464 --> 00:25:52.092
That's the truth! I'm telling the truth!

00:25:52.175 --> 00:25:55.845
I know a lot about her
because I've followed her life!

00:25:55.929 --> 00:25:57.138
That's the truth!

00:25:57.222 --> 00:26:00.058
You came back to the mansion
to return to your daughter!

00:26:00.141 --> 00:26:01.268
No!

00:26:01.351 --> 00:26:04.062
No! I was there to read the book!

00:26:04.145 --> 00:26:05.230
The book!

00:26:05.313 --> 00:26:08.108
I wanted to read the book!

00:26:08.191 --> 00:26:09.901
Ingrid's last book!

00:26:09.985 --> 00:26:12.112
The book that didn't get published!

00:26:12.195 --> 00:26:14.197
Please! Please believe me!

00:26:14.281 --> 00:26:15.991
Believe me!

00:26:16.574 --> 00:26:20.328
I'm not Ingrid! I'm not Ingrid!

00:26:20.412 --> 00:26:23.331
I'm not Ingrid!
I'm telling the truth!

00:26:23.415 --> 00:26:25.292
I'm not Ingrid!

00:26:25.375 --> 00:26:27.627
Stop!

00:26:27.711 --> 00:26:30.630
Aah!

00:26:31.047 --> 00:26:33.216
Patrick, look at me. You're blooming.

00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:35.677
Your face looks like
you have a happy filter on.

00:26:37.262 --> 00:26:39.931
- Did they catch her?
- Not yet, Matmat.

00:26:40.015 --> 00:26:41.850
Who are you to make
decisions about my patient?

00:26:41.933 --> 00:26:43.643
Did you really take care of him?

00:26:43.727 --> 00:26:47.063
He always gets nightmares
about butterflies chasing him.

00:26:47.147 --> 00:26:48.815
I have to keep an eye on him, Mia.

00:26:48.898 --> 00:26:51.276
Are you saying that this is our destiny?

00:26:51.359 --> 00:26:55.030
While I'm by Matmat's side,
will you stay by mine?
