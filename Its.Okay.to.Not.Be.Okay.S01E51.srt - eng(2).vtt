WEBVTT

00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:02.961
Ahh!

00:00:03.044 --> 00:00:05.547
Why are you smiling
while fighting someone with an umbrella?

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:07.507
- Because it's you.
- I have three dreams.

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:09.092
But two of them already came true.

00:00:09.175 --> 00:00:10.510
- Like what?
- To travel.

00:00:10.593 --> 00:00:12.262
Second, to fight with Matmat.

00:00:12.345 --> 00:00:15.015
It has always been
a dream of mine for us to fight

00:00:15.098 --> 00:00:16.933
like normal siblings do.

00:00:17.017 --> 00:00:18.810
- What's the last one?
- That one's impossible.

00:00:19.644 --> 00:00:20.895
I like her.

00:00:21.771 --> 00:00:24.190
Patpat is happy?

00:00:24.274 --> 00:00:26.568
By the way, the hospital called.

00:00:26.651 --> 00:00:28.194
They said he can't be operated on anymore

00:00:28.278 --> 00:00:29.612
because of his brain tumor.

00:00:29.696 --> 00:00:31.448
- Let's go out.
- I can't.

00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:34.242
Matmat asked to hang out.
That doesn't happen often, so I would.

00:00:34.325 --> 00:00:35.910
Let me come with you, please.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.722
Order anything.

00:01:37.806 --> 00:01:39.224
Just order anything, Patpat.

00:01:40.934 --> 00:01:42.852
Are you sure, Matmat?

00:01:46.064 --> 00:01:47.065
Steak.

00:01:48.233 --> 00:01:49.526
You want the steak?

00:01:50.485 --> 00:01:52.904
You've wanted a long time for steak.

00:01:53.738 --> 00:01:54.864
Steak?

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.119
Waiter! Waiter?

00:01:59.202 --> 00:02:01.496
{\an8}Waiter. Waiter.

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:03.581
{\an8}

00:02:03.665 --> 00:02:05.500
{\an8}S-Steak, please.

00:02:06.543 --> 00:02:09.212
{\an8}We'll order rice, too.

00:02:09.295 --> 00:02:12.882
{\an8}Your dishes don't come with rice.

00:02:13.758 --> 00:02:14.759
{\an8}And…

00:02:15.552 --> 00:02:18.012
{\an8}…s-spaghetti.

00:02:19.722 --> 00:02:20.974
{\an8}Is that all, sir? Okay.

00:02:21.975 --> 00:02:23.017
{\an8}Thank you.

00:02:26.396 --> 00:02:28.148
{\an8}Are you excited, Patpat?

00:02:29.691 --> 00:02:34.154
{\an8}

00:02:34.904 --> 00:02:36.447
{\an8}Miss Li,

00:02:36.531 --> 00:02:38.825
{\an8}please give me a chance with Gemma.

00:02:38.908 --> 00:02:40.201
{\an8}It's my turn!

00:02:41.077 --> 00:02:43.246
{\an8}Why are you asking me for a chance?

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:46.958
{\an8}Vincent goes straight to Gemma himself.

00:02:47.667 --> 00:02:49.961
{\an8}Miss Li, that's exactly my point.

00:02:50.044 --> 00:02:53.298
{\an8}That guy with the mustache
always has the opportunities,

00:02:53.381 --> 00:02:56.301
{\an8}always has a window, but me? None.

00:02:56.384 --> 00:02:58.344
Give me a chance too, Miss Li.

00:02:58.428 --> 00:02:59.596
- Oh, sorry.
- Right?

00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:01.389
Remember what we talked about before?

00:03:01.472 --> 00:03:05.476
I said next time,
I hope the fight is fair.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.811
Remember?

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:10.231
{\an8}- We agreed that, Miss Li.
Yeah, but…

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:14.110
{\an8}it seems like you don't
really like Gemma anymore.

00:03:14.193 --> 00:03:17.030
{\an8}-
Miss Li, what are you saying?

00:03:17.113 --> 00:03:20.825
{\an8}Would I be this upset
if Gemma wasn't in my heart?

00:03:21.784 --> 00:03:22.911
{\an8}You take that.

00:03:22.994 --> 00:03:25.914
{\an8}Because if you really love Gemma,

00:03:25.997 --> 00:03:28.041
{\an8}then you should be
putting in extra effort.

00:03:28.124 --> 00:03:29.709
{\an8}Isn't that right, Madeth?

00:03:30.335 --> 00:03:34.213
{\an8}Miss Li, the rice is so soft.

00:03:34.297 --> 00:03:35.256
{\an8}It's delicious.

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:36.382
{\an8}Is the rice good?

00:03:37.008 --> 00:03:38.801
{\an8}Miss Li, don't worry about Madeth.

00:03:38.885 --> 00:03:40.511
{\an8}She's thinking of something else.

00:03:40.595 --> 00:03:41.721
{\an8}Is that true, Madeth?

00:03:41.804 --> 00:03:43.223
{\an8}Are you thinking of something else?

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.808
{\an8}Okay, let's just do this.

00:03:45.892 --> 00:03:47.936
{\an8}The next time I want to make a move,

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:50.188
{\an8}don't interfere, please.

00:03:51.773 --> 00:03:53.233
Of course, I won't.

00:03:53.316 --> 00:03:56.194
Because I already
know where this is heading.

00:03:59.072 --> 00:04:01.449
To be young and so in love.

00:04:16.673 --> 00:04:18.591
T-That's yours, Patpat.

00:04:19.092 --> 00:04:21.094
That's for you.

00:04:31.187 --> 00:04:32.063
Mmm.

00:04:37.318 --> 00:04:38.278
It's good?

00:04:38.695 --> 00:04:40.446
- It's good!
- It's good!

00:04:43.032 --> 00:04:45.076
Have some of this, too.

00:04:50.707 --> 00:04:51.791
There, like that.

00:04:51.874 --> 00:04:53.001
Like that.

00:05:02.927 --> 00:05:05.680
Mmm!

00:05:05.763 --> 00:05:07.181
It really is good!

00:05:12.228 --> 00:05:14.731
- Eat it all, Patpat.
- Mm-hmm.

00:05:47.096 --> 00:05:47.972
Mmm.

00:05:53.436 --> 00:05:54.437
Here.

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:03.696
It's expensive.

00:06:04.197 --> 00:06:06.991
Matmat will pay for it.

00:06:08.201 --> 00:06:09.327
Matmat, it seems expensive.

00:06:14.415 --> 00:06:16.292
T-That's wrong.

00:06:16.375 --> 00:06:17.877
The bill is wrong.

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.337
It's wrong.

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:21.547
We only ordered a little.

00:06:33.726 --> 00:06:35.228
It's wrong.

00:06:35.311 --> 00:06:39.690
Matmat will only pay for what we ordered.

00:06:53.704 --> 00:06:56.207
That's all Matmat will pay.

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:03.464
Patpat.

00:07:12.849 --> 00:07:13.850
So…

00:07:14.725 --> 00:07:18.396
you'll still have
money when you go to work.

00:07:22.358 --> 00:07:23.484
Don't cry.

00:07:37.748 --> 00:07:43.004
Matmat will go down
and talk to the manager.

00:07:44.088 --> 00:07:46.507
So we don't get scammed.

00:07:49.051 --> 00:07:50.470
Follow soon, Patpat.

00:07:50.553 --> 00:07:51.637
Follow, okay?

00:08:00.438 --> 00:08:02.273
Mister Waiter?

00:08:02.356 --> 00:08:04.859
O-Our bill is wrong.

00:08:04.942 --> 00:08:10.531
We ordered steak,
spaghetti, juice and rice.

00:08:10.615 --> 00:08:11.991
The bill is wrong.

00:08:12.074 --> 00:08:15.077
- The steak, spaghetti--
- But sir…

00:08:15.495 --> 00:08:16.871
who'll pay for what she ate?

00:08:19.207 --> 00:08:20.249
Hi, Matmat.

00:08:23.669 --> 00:08:25.379
What are you doing here?

00:08:25.463 --> 00:08:27.840
Patpat, what's she doing here?

00:08:28.341 --> 00:08:29.759
Eating, like you.

00:08:30.968 --> 00:08:33.095
I'm not paying for what she ate.

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:37.141
I'm not paying for her food.

00:08:37.517 --> 00:08:38.601
Matmat?

00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:40.436
Matmat, wait.

00:08:41.354 --> 00:08:42.939
Matmat, you're walking out again?

00:08:43.022 --> 00:08:44.982
- How much is her bill?
- About 2,000, sir.

00:08:46.526 --> 00:08:48.402
Matmat, give me an allowance, too.

00:08:49.237 --> 00:08:50.696
When I saw you earlier,

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:52.490
You gave Patrick an allowance.

00:08:52.573 --> 00:08:55.826
I-I won't give you an allowance.

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:58.829
I only give an allowance to my sibling.

00:08:59.455 --> 00:09:01.207
Matmat, I don't have a family anymore.

00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:03.292
No one else will give me an allowance.

00:09:04.669 --> 00:09:06.170
Please, Matmat!

00:09:06.712 --> 00:09:08.256
I want a sibling!

00:09:08.839 --> 00:09:11.342
I want an older brother like you!

00:09:21.561 --> 00:09:24.438
Patpat, come on now. Let's go home.

00:09:42.873 --> 00:09:44.333
Mia, let's go.

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:04.353
Come on, Matmat.

00:10:04.437 --> 00:10:06.647
I knew you'd take me with you anyway.

00:10:10.109 --> 00:10:12.528
Next time,
when your older brother calls you,

00:10:12.612 --> 00:10:13.779
you come right away.

00:10:16.032 --> 00:10:17.325
Sorry, Matmat.

00:10:20.286 --> 00:10:21.579
Let's go home.

00:10:35.885 --> 00:10:37.178
Hi, hi!

00:10:37.261 --> 00:10:38.387
Ducks!

00:10:38.721 --> 00:10:39.889
Slow down, Matmat.

00:10:40.556 --> 00:10:42.099
Hi, ducks!

00:10:45.394 --> 00:10:49.482
Matmat, do you know
the story of the ugly duckling?

00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:52.735
T-The…

00:10:53.569 --> 00:10:57.156
the duck that was bullied by its siblings

00:10:57.698 --> 00:10:59.241
because it was different?

00:10:59.742 --> 00:11:00.785
Yes, that one.

00:11:03.287 --> 00:11:04.413
He ran away, right?

00:11:05.623 --> 00:11:07.750
He left his family because

00:11:09.126 --> 00:11:10.294
he was sad.

00:11:15.216 --> 00:11:16.675
Do you think, Matmat…

00:11:19.678 --> 00:11:26.310
if the mother had made
that different duck feel loved…

00:11:29.814 --> 00:11:31.148
would it still have left?

00:11:35.694 --> 00:11:36.946
No.

00:11:38.864 --> 00:11:39.865
Why?

00:11:40.866 --> 00:11:45.413
Be-Because the mother duck accepted

00:11:46.997 --> 00:11:49.125
her child, even though it was different.

00:11:51.585 --> 00:11:54.922
I hope all adults
learn how to accept the younger ones.

00:11:55.506 --> 00:12:00.136
So that those without a mom,
or dad, or relatives

00:12:00.219 --> 00:12:02.763
won't be sad for being alone.

00:12:03.139 --> 00:12:04.140
You're here.

00:12:05.724 --> 00:12:08.477
Careful, Mia, you might fall.

00:12:10.229 --> 00:12:11.647
Matmat is right.

00:12:12.606 --> 00:12:13.941
Mia, look.

00:12:28.456 --> 00:12:29.582
Let's go inside.

00:12:36.672 --> 00:12:38.215
Thank you, Matmat.

00:12:38.299 --> 00:12:39.758
You're welcome, Mia.

00:13:39.485 --> 00:13:42.821
- Morning!
- It's not good when it's burnt.

00:13:45.491 --> 00:13:46.784
What happened here?

00:13:46.867 --> 00:13:50.788
T-The bread is burnt. The food is burnt.

00:13:50.871 --> 00:13:54.041
You told me it's important
to have breakfast before work.

00:13:54.124 --> 00:13:56.627
So here, I prepared breakfast.

00:13:57.503 --> 00:13:59.922
You should have
woken me up so I could cook.

00:14:00.506 --> 00:14:02.591
I tried to wake you up, Patpat.

00:14:03.384 --> 00:14:05.177
But you wouldn't wake up.

00:14:06.011 --> 00:14:07.680
- I didn't wake up?
- No.

00:14:07.763 --> 00:14:09.223
Even I tried to wake you up.

00:14:09.598 --> 00:14:11.809
I even shouted at you,
but you were so out of it.

00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:15.729
You slapped Patpat.

00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:19.942
Next time, don't slap. That's bad.

00:14:20.025 --> 00:14:21.861
I just did it to wake him up.

00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:26.699
Did you have a beautiful dream?

00:14:26.782 --> 00:14:28.617
That's why you wouldn't wake up?

00:14:32.538 --> 00:14:34.957
Matmat, I'll cook. What do you want?

00:14:36.375 --> 00:14:40.462
P-People in books should have names.

00:14:40.546 --> 00:14:41.547
Okay.

00:14:42.256 --> 00:14:46.051
The Masked Boy, Mister Box,

00:14:46.135 --> 00:14:50.139
and the Princess Without Feelings.

00:14:50.222 --> 00:14:52.266
T-That's not what I mean.

00:14:52.349 --> 00:14:55.394
Matthew Gonzales, Mia Hernandez…

00:14:55.477 --> 00:14:57.062
Names like that.

00:14:57.146 --> 00:14:59.440
I don't like that.
It's too predictable.

00:14:59.523 --> 00:15:02.026
In all my books,
the characters don't have names.

00:15:02.109 --> 00:15:05.988
No Edgar, no Richard, no Satsat…

00:15:06.071 --> 00:15:07.448
No names.

00:15:07.531 --> 00:15:10.826
But if they're people,
they should have names.

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:13.037
Mia! Matmat!

00:15:13.954 --> 00:15:14.914
What do you want to eat?

00:15:15.497 --> 00:15:18.167
M-Matmat is full, Patpat.

00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:19.251
No, I'm okay.

00:15:20.878 --> 00:15:21.879
Alright.

00:15:21.962 --> 00:15:23.172
I'll just eat outside.

00:15:23.255 --> 00:15:25.633
Matmat, do you want some batchoy?

00:15:25.716 --> 00:15:27.801
Matmat, I'm the writer,

00:15:27.885 --> 00:15:30.262
so you should listen to me when I say

00:15:30.346 --> 00:15:31.889
they don't have names.

00:15:31.972 --> 00:15:34.642
I'm your older brother,
so you listen to me.

00:15:35.476 --> 00:15:36.936
Okay, I'll go take a shower.

00:15:37.019 --> 00:15:38.437
Just message me if you need anything.

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:40.189
Matmat, you have a session later.

00:15:40.272 --> 00:15:42.191
I-I'll go see the doctor this afternoon.

00:15:42.274 --> 00:15:44.026
I won't forget.

00:15:45.152 --> 00:15:46.570
Matmat, happy day?

00:15:47.613 --> 00:15:50.324
H-Happy day!

00:15:51.617 --> 00:15:52.785
- Happy day!
- Happy day!

00:15:52.868 --> 00:15:54.286
Happy day!

00:15:54.828 --> 00:15:57.915
It's a happy day if Mia listens.

00:15:57.998 --> 00:16:00.209
I-I'm your older brother.

00:16:01.168 --> 00:16:03.879
You're my older brother,
but you should listen to me

00:16:03.963 --> 00:16:06.590
because I'm being very objective here.

00:16:06.674 --> 00:16:08.926
They shouldn't have names, Matmat.

00:16:09.009 --> 00:16:11.220
T-That's not good.

00:16:11.303 --> 00:16:13.889
I've been writing for a long time,
so listen to me.

00:16:14.848 --> 00:16:16.767
Yes, I will be there.

00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:17.685
Okay, I'll see you.

00:16:17.768 --> 00:16:18.811
Okay, bye.

00:16:19.937 --> 00:16:22.439
Madeth! Madeth!

00:16:22.523 --> 00:16:24.900
Come here, come to me!

00:16:25.734 --> 00:16:28.362
The fruit of my labor
is finally happening!

00:16:28.445 --> 00:16:30.197
Hey, Boss V!

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:32.449
The fruit of "our" labor
are finally paying off!

00:16:32.533 --> 00:16:34.702
- I'm part of this, too!
- Right, right.

00:16:34.785 --> 00:16:36.578
The fruits of our labor.

00:16:36.662 --> 00:16:37.997
Because you'll be working.

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:39.957
What kind of work, Boss V?

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:41.500
Mia has a new endorsement!

00:16:41.583 --> 00:16:44.211
- Endorsement!
- Hey, good news!

00:16:44.294 --> 00:16:45.462
What endorsement?

00:16:45.546 --> 00:16:46.505
A cellphone.

00:16:46.588 --> 00:16:49.758
They saw Mia's post
that she's writing a new book,

00:16:49.842 --> 00:16:51.969
and they want to be part of it.

00:16:52.052 --> 00:16:54.221
- Cellphone?
- Mm-hmm.

00:16:54.304 --> 00:16:56.765
Boss V, is that with Miss Erica?

00:16:57.182 --> 00:16:58.434
Yes, it's her.

00:16:58.517 --> 00:16:59.977
- She's the one I talked to.
- Oh!

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:01.645
Mm-hmm.

00:17:01.729 --> 00:17:05.024
And as early as now,
she wants Mia to post

00:17:05.107 --> 00:17:08.444
about a day in the life of a writer,
using their latest phone.

00:17:09.153 --> 00:17:12.114
Hey, I like that, Boss V!

00:17:12.197 --> 00:17:13.782
When do we start work?

00:17:13.866 --> 00:17:15.367
- Today.
- Today?

00:17:15.451 --> 00:17:19.455
Go to their merchant
and pick up the cellphone

00:17:19.538 --> 00:17:21.123
so you and Mia can shoot today.

00:17:21.206 --> 00:17:23.167
Oh, Miss Erica!

00:17:24.168 --> 00:17:27.087
Gemma, I hope it's okay
that I head back to Manila.

00:17:27.838 --> 00:17:29.465
I'll message you.

00:17:30.382 --> 00:17:32.593
That's your job.
Go ahead. Take care of it.

00:17:34.344 --> 00:17:36.638
Miss Li, I'll book my ticket now, okay?

00:17:36.722 --> 00:17:38.307
I won't be able to go with you.

00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:40.684
Alright, I'll prepare something
for you to take on the plane.

00:17:40.768 --> 00:17:42.603
- Okay, thank you.
- Take care, Boss V!

00:17:42.686 --> 00:17:45.439
- Do what I told you.
- I got this, Boss V!

00:17:45.522 --> 00:17:47.149
Ooh!

00:17:47.232 --> 00:17:48.734
This is it. This is really it!

00:17:48.817 --> 00:17:50.819
Back to work! This is it!

00:17:51.403 --> 00:17:53.155
Looks like a special client, huh?

00:17:53.947 --> 00:17:55.783
Vincent's really going back to Manila?

00:17:55.866 --> 00:17:59.036
Oh yes, Gemma, it's very special.

00:17:59.119 --> 00:18:01.246
Because aside from
it being Mia's first time

00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:06.502
endorsing a cellphone,
the client is special, too.

00:18:06.585 --> 00:18:10.089
You see, Miss Erica has
known Boss V for a long time.

00:18:10.422 --> 00:18:12.674
- She's his ex.
- His ex?

00:18:12.758 --> 00:18:15.177
- Yes, Nanay.
- Why did they break up?

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:16.345
When?

00:18:17.429 --> 00:18:18.430
Ma.

00:18:19.306 --> 00:18:20.390
Oh.

00:18:20.474 --> 00:18:22.059
I'm just curious, dear.

00:18:22.142 --> 00:18:24.895
You know me, I'm a responsible gossip…

00:18:24.978 --> 00:18:29.191
"CARESS THE SHADOW"

00:18:30.859 --> 00:18:32.820
"In every moment,

00:18:33.445 --> 00:18:38.784
time will water the hope that at last,

00:18:39.368 --> 00:18:44.248
our hearts will finally be together."

00:18:49.211 --> 00:18:53.090
It's different when you
read poetry from before to now.

00:18:55.134 --> 00:18:57.636
It's different if you read it here

00:18:57.719 --> 00:18:59.429
or at the mansion.

00:19:01.265 --> 00:19:02.724
I hope…

00:19:02.808 --> 00:19:05.310
you and I can be
together at the mansion.

00:19:15.237 --> 00:19:16.321
Here you are again.

00:19:17.072 --> 00:19:19.575
You only come to see me
when you need something.

00:19:20.409 --> 00:19:22.828
You said I can visit
when I have nothing to do?

00:19:22.911 --> 00:19:25.122
Of course, because
your number one and two aren't here.

00:19:25.581 --> 00:19:29.334
I know I'm only your number three.

00:19:29.418 --> 00:19:31.253
You're being dramatic again.

00:19:34.506 --> 00:19:35.674
Actually,

00:19:35.757 --> 00:19:38.468
what if you help me out today?

00:19:39.178 --> 00:19:41.054
- Huh?
- Look at those two.

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:45.851
You're making me work on my day off?

00:19:45.934 --> 00:19:48.645
It's okay. Come on, same old…

00:19:49.188 --> 00:19:50.522
Hello, ladies!

00:19:50.606 --> 00:19:52.900
Welcome to Jason's Inasal.

00:19:52.983 --> 00:19:54.985
What would you like to order today?

00:19:55.068 --> 00:19:56.278
Um…

00:19:56.361 --> 00:19:57.905
We'll have whatever he orders.

00:19:57.988 --> 00:20:00.199
Oh.

00:20:00.282 --> 00:20:01.825
What's your order, bro?

00:20:01.909 --> 00:20:04.036
Just offer them your best seller.

00:20:04.119 --> 00:20:06.413
Double chicken breast with heart, ma'am.

00:20:06.496 --> 00:20:08.040
- Let me write that down.
- Just chicken breast.

00:20:08.123 --> 00:20:10.209
I don't want it with heart.

00:20:10.292 --> 00:20:12.044
Okay. Then give us the
chicken breast, please.

00:20:12.127 --> 00:20:14.254
Okay. How many orders?

00:20:14.671 --> 00:20:15.923
Oh, one, two

00:20:16.006 --> 00:20:18.050
Okay. One, two.

00:20:18.133 --> 00:20:19.468
Okay. Coming right up.

00:20:19.551 --> 00:20:21.762
Help me out here, man.

00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:27.517
Hello!

00:20:27.601 --> 00:20:29.478
Are you alone?

00:20:30.729 --> 00:20:32.064
Yes, I guess.

00:20:33.232 --> 00:20:35.234
You look like a local.

00:20:35.317 --> 00:20:37.277
Can you recommend
some places we can go to?

00:20:37.361 --> 00:20:39.363
We're traveling from San Jose.

00:20:39.446 --> 00:20:41.114
It's our first time here to Maravida.

00:20:41.198 --> 00:20:43.033
When the cat is away,

00:20:43.116 --> 00:20:45.661
the mice will play.

00:20:47.496 --> 00:20:49.957
"Looks like my friend is popular".

00:20:51.625 --> 00:20:54.419
You can't touch Patrick like that!

00:21:09.851 --> 00:21:12.646
Where do you work?

00:21:12.729 --> 00:21:14.022
At a hospital.

00:21:14.106 --> 00:21:15.315
You're a nurse?

00:21:15.399 --> 00:21:17.526
For sure you are. You look nice

00:21:17.609 --> 00:21:18.944
and caring-- Ow!

00:21:19.027 --> 00:21:20.445
He's caring but not about you.

00:21:20.529 --> 00:21:21.655
- Mia. Mia.
- Excuse me.

00:21:21.738 --> 00:21:24.199
Why are you meddling with us?
Who do you think you are?

00:21:24.741 --> 00:21:27.202
You don't who I am? How refreshing!

00:21:27.286 --> 00:21:28.537
- Mia, that's enough.
- Ma'am.

00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:30.414
Your order is ready.
Let's go to the other table.

00:21:30.497 --> 00:21:31.790
Come on. Let's go.

00:21:31.873 --> 00:21:33.333
Why are you making us leave?
She's the one making a scene!

00:21:33.417 --> 00:21:35.419
- I'll give you some halo-halo.
- You don't know who I am?!

00:21:35.502 --> 00:21:37.838
I'm your worst-case scenario!

00:21:37.921 --> 00:21:38.880
Hey, Mia.

00:21:38.964 --> 00:21:40.674
You're letting your emotions
control you again.

00:21:40.757 --> 00:21:41.925
It's your fault.

00:21:42.009 --> 00:21:43.677
Why are you even entertaining them?

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:46.346
Why are you here?
Shouldn't you be writing with Matmat?

00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:47.806
He has a therapy session, remember?

00:21:47.889 --> 00:21:49.182
So, you're not busy?

00:21:49.266 --> 00:21:51.393
Miss Mia! Miss Mia.

00:21:51.476 --> 00:21:54.396
Ignore her. Vincent ordered
her to do that for my endorsement.

00:21:54.479 --> 00:21:57.024
A day in the life of
writer Mia Hernandez.

00:21:57.858 --> 00:21:59.943
She's not writing right now.

00:22:00.819 --> 00:22:02.571
Is that how you think writers work?

00:22:02.654 --> 00:22:04.239
Just sitting in front of a laptop?

00:22:14.666 --> 00:22:16.960
- Miss Mia!
- Don't follow us!

00:22:19.421 --> 00:22:20.881
- Uh…
- Bye, bro!

00:22:24.551 --> 00:22:26.553
H-Happy day!

00:22:28.513 --> 00:22:30.474
Happy day, tree!

00:22:32.225 --> 00:22:35.020
H-Happy day, O-OK Hospital!

00:22:35.562 --> 00:22:38.398
Happy day, flowers!

00:22:39.483 --> 00:22:41.902
Happy day, plants!

00:22:41.985 --> 00:22:44.029
- H-Happy day!
- Hello, Matmat!

00:22:44.112 --> 00:22:46.364
Wait, you seem like
you're in a good mood.

00:22:46.448 --> 00:22:47.908
What made you happy today?

00:22:48.408 --> 00:22:50.952
A lot. The sky,

00:22:51.036 --> 00:22:54.414
the plants, and my story with Mia.

00:22:54.498 --> 00:22:55.707
- Bye-bye!
- Bye-bye!

00:22:59.169 --> 00:23:00.712
Happy day!

00:23:00.796 --> 00:23:03.256
Matmat!
I didn't know you were here.

00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:05.258
Happy day, Ma'am Eden.

00:23:07.928 --> 00:23:09.387
Good morning, Matmat.

00:23:10.722 --> 00:23:12.182
Happy day, Doc…

00:23:12.265 --> 00:23:13.475
Scammer.

00:23:29.032 --> 00:23:32.285
Why didn't you let Madeth tag along?
She knows what to do.

00:23:33.578 --> 00:23:35.831
I don't want anyone following us.

00:23:35.914 --> 00:23:37.958
It won't come off as natural.

00:23:38.834 --> 00:23:40.961
How does this show
a day in the life of a writer?

00:23:42.337 --> 00:23:44.631
Patrick, oh, Patrick.

00:23:44.714 --> 00:23:47.676
Writers don't have to write all the time.

00:23:48.135 --> 00:23:51.221
Sometimes we need to do things

00:23:51.596 --> 00:23:53.598
that will give us inspiration.

00:23:54.224 --> 00:23:55.559
Like…

00:23:56.893 --> 00:23:58.562
this.

00:23:59.938 --> 00:24:01.231
And this.

00:24:03.984 --> 00:24:06.611
These are the sources of my inspiration.

00:24:08.738 --> 00:24:09.698
Give me that.

00:24:10.448 --> 00:24:11.908
Repeat what you just said.

00:24:11.992 --> 00:24:13.326
You're going to film me?

00:24:13.410 --> 00:24:14.244
Mm-hmm.

00:24:15.537 --> 00:24:17.414
Go on. Say it again.

00:24:17.497 --> 00:24:19.291
The one about inspiration.

00:24:20.959 --> 00:24:22.460
Hmm…

00:24:23.670 --> 00:24:26.840
Like what Pablo Picasso said,

00:24:26.923 --> 00:24:28.967
"Inspiration exists,

00:24:29.050 --> 00:24:31.178
but it has to find you working."

00:24:34.389 --> 00:24:36.057
That's not what you said.

00:24:38.935 --> 00:24:40.770
But it's still beautiful.

00:24:40.854 --> 00:24:43.106
I was inspired by what you said.

00:24:44.983 --> 00:24:46.651
Is this for your book?

00:24:46.735 --> 00:24:47.777
Mm-hmm.

00:24:48.486 --> 00:24:50.322
And among all my books,

00:24:50.405 --> 00:24:52.908
This is the one
I want published the most.

00:24:54.534 --> 00:24:55.577
Why is that?

00:24:55.952 --> 00:24:58.997
Because inspired by the three of us.
You, Matmat, and me.

00:25:00.207 --> 00:25:02.792
Do it because the story is beautiful,

00:25:02.876 --> 00:25:04.252
not because of us.

00:25:05.545 --> 00:25:09.090
Our story is beautiful, period.

00:25:14.179 --> 00:25:15.180
Mm.

00:25:25.523 --> 00:25:26.691
Matmat.

00:25:28.235 --> 00:25:30.028
Did you come here with the purpose

00:25:30.111 --> 00:25:31.863
not to make eye contact with me?

00:25:32.697 --> 00:25:34.866
I came here for the session.

00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:37.410
Patpat said I have a therapy session.

00:25:37.494 --> 00:25:40.705
That's why Matmat is here.

00:25:40.789 --> 00:25:44.167
Really? Or are
you here to collect your payment?

00:25:45.210 --> 00:25:47.087
Mm-hmm.

00:25:47.837 --> 00:25:49.589
Didn't I tell you

00:25:49.673 --> 00:25:51.174
that I won't pay you

00:25:51.258 --> 00:25:53.885
if you don't paint
a butterfly in your mural?

00:25:53.969 --> 00:25:56.096
Y-You…

00:25:56.179 --> 00:25:58.181
don't have

00:25:58.807 --> 00:26:00.392
a word of honor,

00:26:00.934 --> 00:26:02.269
Doc Scammer.

00:26:02.352 --> 00:26:03.395
Matmat,

00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:05.730
I'm not scamming you.

00:26:06.439 --> 00:26:10.568
I just want to help you
overcome your fear of butterflies.

00:26:10.652 --> 00:26:12.862
M-My fear

00:26:13.530 --> 00:26:15.240
only gets worse

00:26:15.323 --> 00:26:18.618
whenever you force
me to paint butterflies.

00:26:18.994 --> 00:26:20.370
"Face your fears."

00:26:20.453 --> 00:26:22.539
That's a famous saying.

00:26:22.622 --> 00:26:24.541
You should do that.

00:26:25.041 --> 00:26:29.129
That way Patrick, will stop being affected
by your fear of butterflies.

00:26:31.631 --> 00:26:33.967
P-Patpat is being…

00:26:34.968 --> 00:26:37.262
affected? He's having a hard time?

00:26:38.221 --> 00:26:40.348
I think he's getting affected.

00:26:40.807 --> 00:26:42.642
Sometimes we don't notice,

00:26:43.351 --> 00:26:46.771
but our fears affect
the people around us.

00:26:47.397 --> 00:26:50.525
Because they worry about our condition.

00:26:51.359 --> 00:26:53.320
Patrick isn't complaining,

00:26:53.403 --> 00:26:55.780
but I think he's having a hard time.

00:27:04.789 --> 00:27:05.915
Ma'am Olivia!

00:27:06.583 --> 00:27:09.085
I saw you accompany
Mister Samuel outside.

00:27:10.837 --> 00:27:12.505
Did you read him a book?

00:27:13.131 --> 00:27:14.382
Just some poems.

00:27:15.425 --> 00:27:17.177
You like poems?

00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:18.928
I like reading them.

00:27:19.804 --> 00:27:23.058
Is it okay if I read
him one of Mia's books?

00:27:24.142 --> 00:27:27.937
We're here
to help our patients, right?

00:27:33.818 --> 00:27:35.028
Poems?

00:27:35.945 --> 00:27:37.197
Then it's you.

00:27:37.822 --> 00:27:40.658
You're the one giving
those letters to Samuel.

00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:45.747
Do you know that in other countries,

00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:48.375
they see butterflies as a cure?

00:27:49.250 --> 00:27:52.045
S-Something that heals?

00:27:52.128 --> 00:27:55.715
Yes. Others see them

00:27:55.799 --> 00:27:57.967
as a symbol of new hope

00:27:58.051 --> 00:27:59.594
or a fresh start.

00:28:02.597 --> 00:28:06.518
B-Butterflies can cure illnesses?

00:28:06.601 --> 00:28:09.354
Not all butterflies are bad.

00:28:09.813 --> 00:28:12.107
There are butterflies that can help you.

00:28:12.565 --> 00:28:16.528
Are you telling the truth, Doc?
Or are you just scamming me?

00:28:17.904 --> 00:28:22.158
Matmat, if I wanted to scam you,
why would I try to help you?

00:28:23.201 --> 00:28:25.078
We can do this, Matmat.

00:28:25.161 --> 00:28:27.956
I'm telling you,
one day, you'll be surprised

00:28:28.039 --> 00:28:30.291
and there will be
a butterfly in your painting.

00:28:30.375 --> 00:28:32.669
And that would be your fresh start.

00:28:37.298 --> 00:28:38.383
If,

00:28:39.008 --> 00:28:43.847
I overcome my fear of butterflies,

00:28:44.389 --> 00:28:45.932
I'll have a fresh start?

00:28:46.641 --> 00:28:48.977
Fresh start where? In work?

00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:50.562
Not only in your work,

00:28:50.645 --> 00:28:52.605
but a fresh start in life.

00:29:03.575 --> 00:29:05.076
My heart is big enough

00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:07.245
that it can share all my love.

00:29:07.328 --> 00:29:08.955
It's a win for me.

00:29:09.038 --> 00:29:12.917
I'm so happy that
you and Matmat are living here with me.

00:29:13.001 --> 00:29:14.419
Free from the pain.

00:29:15.044 --> 00:29:16.921
He thought I was Ingrid!

00:29:17.005 --> 00:29:18.339
I'm not her!

00:29:18.423 --> 00:29:19.632
He wants to kill me!

00:29:19.716 --> 00:29:21.718
Could Samuel
and Mia be in danger too?

00:29:21.801 --> 00:29:23.428
She's the only
one who could've put this here.

00:29:23.511 --> 00:29:25.346
Are you scared of butterflies, too?
