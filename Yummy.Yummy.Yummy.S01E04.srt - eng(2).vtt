00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:48.700
No one's eating?

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:55.140
Listen,

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.780
this whole "bowing for blessings" thing,

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:57.620
how could he believe that?

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.260
And he actually let us out.

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.380
In my opinion, it's all thanks
to our ancestor.

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.140
Bonds across generations.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.300
Even if bones break,

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:05.490
the sinews stay connected.

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:07.660
He didn't believe it at all.

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:10.140
Then why did he release us?

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:10.980
Exactly.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.700
Vice Prefect, if you want me to leave,

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.980
I'll take my family and go.

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:18.980
Just say the word.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.260
That's not what I meant.

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:22.620
It's just

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.180
that my childhood memories

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.380
of the Shen family are unclear.

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:27.780
Many things require confirmation.

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.060
Anyway, he didn't believe it.

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:36.940
What time is it now?

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.260
How can you still eat?

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:39.500
Exactly.

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.700
Since coming to Yong'an,

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.180
we've made too many mistakes.

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.020
We must review them thoroughly

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:46.450
and figure out whose faults they are.

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.060
Sorry, Mom.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.140
My mistake.

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:51.580
I bear responsibility.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:52.860
As for worshipping the ancestor,

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.020
I suggested it.

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.100
But you can't blame it

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:56.660
all on me.

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.860
If you ask me,

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.180
the biggest responsibility lies

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.140
with Jicai.

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:06.140
How is this my fault?

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.980
How isn't it...?

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.220
How isn't it your fault?

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.110
You told one lie

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.380
and needed a hundred more to cover it.

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:12.700
Wasn't it you who claimed to be

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.380
the ancestor's fiancee
with that upside-down logic?

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:15.200
Huh?

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:16.140
It...

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.060
No words now?

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.580
And tracing it back,

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:20.620
I blame her more.

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.020
Tell me,

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.760
if you hadn't dragged us
into filming that short video,

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:25.780
would we be here?

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.180
I'd be sleeping soundly at home.

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.340
Would I be in Yong'an?

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.260
I agree on this point.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.220
What does this have to do with my video?

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.500
The script you wrote
was about our family

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.460
traveling back to ancient times

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:38.340
to cook for our ancestor, right?

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:39.580
Yeah. That dish... What was it called?

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.160
- Spring Water Lamb!
- Spring Water Lamb!

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.060
Auntie's script
was about time travel, right?

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:45.700
Jicai,

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:46.660
think carefully.

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:48.540
What else did your script say?

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:50.460
Auntie's script said

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.060
that our family accidentally
traveled to ancient times,

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.300
met a cold-blooded,

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:56.420
ruthless ancestor,

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.620
and finally, on a full moon night,

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.500
moved him with a perfect bowl

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:01.360
of Spring Water Lamb.

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.560
Then we returned to the modern era.

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:05.500
Thinking carefully,

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.020
the current plot

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:08.500
really matches my script

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:09.460
almost exactly.

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.700
Then this is simple.

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:13.700
Let's just keep acting

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.020
according to Jicai's script.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:16.180
On the full moon night,

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.140
make a pot of Spring Water Lamb

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:19.340
for the ancestor.

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:20.900
Won't we go back then?

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.860
But the ancestor's suspicion of us

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:24.980
grows heavier.

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:26.900
We must find a way to stabilize him,

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.260
or we'll be sliced up

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:29.660
before the full moon.

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:30.980
How do we stabilize him?

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:31.820
By having you break

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:32.940
your limits for a marriage?

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:34.480
Stop talking nonsense!

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:35.750
Listen, if you keep spouting that,

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:36.610
when we all leave,

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:37.660
we'll leave you here alone.

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.900
Everyone,

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.380
bonding

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.100
happens

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:43.940
meal by meal.

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.620
Our ancestor eats

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.260
prison-like food daily.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:50.660
If we cook something good,

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:51.820
and he eats happily,

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:53.740
won't he be easier to talk to?

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:01.940
Young Master, if you don't verify

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.490
the records of the Cui case personally,

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:04.980
you won't rest easy.

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.100
By rights, I should go with you.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.720
But the Court of Judicial Review
is heavily guarded.

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:10.660
I...

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.980
dare not go.

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:13.820
I can only urge you, Young Master,

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:15.180
to be cautious in all things.

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:16.820
Excellent.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:20.780
Young Master, without my protection,

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:21.980
you must be careful.

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.780
(East Kitchen)

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:41.380
Just marinating meat at night,

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:42.900
why do I feel like a thief?

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:08.660
Vice Prefect.

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:13.900
Good evening, Vice Prefect.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.580
If nothing's wrong, I'll head off first.

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:20.580
You can recognize me?

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:25.380
(TV dramas never lie!)

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:26.530
(Ancient people truly believed)

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:28.100
(that a face mask was a disguise.)

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:31.700
Vice Prefect,
your stature is exceptional,

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:32.980
elegant,

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:33.820
and unmatched.

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:35.180
Of course, I recognize you.

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:40.700
Sneaking around late at night,

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:42.260
what are you doing?

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:44.020
Vice Prefect, please don't say that.

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:46.020
Look at yourself...

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:48.780
I didn't get full

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:50.290
from porridge and steamed buns tonight.

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:51.580
I wanted to check the kitchen

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:52.620
for leftovers,

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:53.820
but I found nothing.

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:57.130
You're traveling at night,

00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:58.820
must be important business?

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:00.300
Relax.

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:02.060
I saw nothing.

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:05.100
Nothing at all.

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:07.860
(She's threatening me.)

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:15.020
I know where you come from

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:17.500
and your purpose

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:19.740
at Yunshui Manor.

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:22.980
(How could the ancestor know)

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:24.780
(that I'm from the modern era?)

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:27.220
Take me to see them.

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:30.980
Take you to see them?

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:35.020
You want to return with us?

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:36.900
No, that'd cause chaos!

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:37.820
I promise!

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:38.880
I promise to take you back!

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:41.540
(Agreeing so easily)

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:43.160
(and taking me
to meet those behind her,)

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:44.860
(is she afraid to die)

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:47.020
(or scheming something else?)

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:48.620
(Am I insane?)

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:50.480
(Promising to take an ancient person
to the modern era?)

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:51.340
(Have I lost my mind?)

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:52.980
What do your people

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:54.740
say?

00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:56.900
My people?

00:07:57.660 --> 00:07:59.580
(Not those crappy relatives, right?)

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:01.740
(Wait, how does he know everything?)

00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:04.660
(But who dares question
this brutal ancestor?)

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:06.100
Speak!

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:07.100
What plans do those people

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:08.260
have for me?

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:10.300
What plans could they have for you?

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:11.980
They'd be terrified seeing you!

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:14.020
We want to find a way back, too.

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:15.300
But we're unsure.

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:16.620
Promising to take you

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:18.020
is just... doing our best.

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:19.700
Even if we take you,

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:21.060
they might refuse to see you.

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:22.340
They don't even see us,

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:24.220
and they rejected our New Year visits
over a dozen times!

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:25.580
Our family's fallen on hard times.

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:26.900
We're utterly unwelcome there.

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:30.900
So,

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:33.620
those people abandoned you?

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:36.180
Then what's the use of keeping you?

00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:40.140
That's too harsh.

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:41.900
Selecting you

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:43.340
and arranging you here.

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:45.020
There must be a reason.

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:47.140
I wish I knew why, too!

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:06.180
Vice Prefect, rest assured.

00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:07.700
If we find a way,

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:08.820
we'll take you back.

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:10.300
Okay?

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:41.820
Why would he want to come home with us?

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:44.460
Did you misunderstand something?

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:45.620
He recently thought

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:47.020
we were his fake relatives.

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:48.540
How does he know everything now?

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:49.380
I'm shocked too.

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:50.780
I wish it were a misunderstanding.

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:52.100
Honestly,

00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:54.100
he's truly our ancestor.

00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:56.460
All-knowing and omnipotent.

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:58.380
Dad, another mouth

00:09:58.380 --> 00:09:59.740
to feed back home.

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:01.060
We return with nothing,

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:02.180
struggling to feed ourselves.

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:03.420
How can we support him?

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:05.540
But he is our ancestor.

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:07.140
If he asks,

00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:08.780
can we descendants do nothing?

00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:10.060
That's not right.

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:11.220
Filial piety, huh?

00:10:11.770 --> 00:10:12.700
Our restaurant's

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:13.940
nearly bankrupt.

00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:15.060
You'll starve yourself,

00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:16.780
still thinking of supporting him?

00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:19.340
Fine.

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:20.980
Since he's your ancestor,

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:22.860
you figure out how to feed him.

00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:26.860
That's not what I mean.

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:28.580
Look, first, we travel back.

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:29.580
Then,

00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:31.260
see if we can return here.

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:32.420
If successful,

00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:34.260
we fetch the ancestor.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.300
But likely, we can't return.

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:37.140
Because this travel

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:38.500
isn't reversible.

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:40.220
Then, we can't

00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:41.300
fetch him,

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:42.220
and he can't

00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:43.260
hold us

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:44.100
accountable.

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:44.980
Right?

00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:46.340
My point is that

00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:47.460
he can't blame us.

00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:49.260
What do you think?

00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:54.660
The people behind the Shen family

00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:56.420
abandoned them,

00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:59.100
yet sent them here.

00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:00.740
That makes...

00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:05.420
no sense!

00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:07.900
Young Master,

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:09.140
why not interrogate

00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:10.580
the Shen family privately?

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:12.500
Wouldn't the truth surface?

00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:13.660
Scaring them

00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:14.500
was one thing.

00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:16.580
Real torture is inappropriate.

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:17.740
This isn't our place.

00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:20.860
Everything near the capital
requires utmost caution.

00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:22.060
Torture is easy.

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:23.480
Dealing with the aftermath isn't.

00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:29.580
Young Master, consider this.

00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:30.900
Could sending

00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:32.980
these five fools

00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:33.820
be meant

00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:35.540
to lull you?

00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:40.900
You mean,

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:42.460
against smart opponents,

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:44.700
you predict their moves.

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:46.660
But when it comes to fools,

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:48.220
they are

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:49.300
unpredictable.

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:51.660
Thus, achieving an unexpected victory?

00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:52.820
Yes!

00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:56.180
I find you

00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:57.980
increasingly perceptive lately.

00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:00.020
Young Master, you think so too?

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:07.620
I kept them hoping to trace the source.

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:09.020
But they seem

00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:10.940
to be useless pawns.

00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:12.420
They can't stay.

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:14.750
Last night, I failed
to find the Cui case files

00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:15.800
at the Court of Judicial Review.

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:17.460
I'll go again tonight.

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:18.740
Meanwhile,

00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:20.420
you handle the Shen family.

00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:22.820
Bury

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:24.700
everything here.

00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:29.620
Bury?

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:32.780
Wait, this task...

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:34.460
to me?

00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:07.420
I don't want to harm anyone.

00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:11.100
But I must protect my Young Master.

00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:13.380
I must guard him well.

00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:14.660
Brother!

00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:16.660
Wake up!

00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:19.900
Wake...

00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:27.140
I truly can't bring myself to do it.

00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:32.380
Deeper.

00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:33.660
Dig deeper!

00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:34.860
Deeper!

00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:43.060
You're awake?

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:45.300
How are you awake?

00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:50.020
Dramas lie!

00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:56.900
You can't knock someone out.

00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:08.300
Dad!

00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:45.420
Who's there?

00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:47.380
That guy broke curfew! After him!

00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:53.860
Gongcai! Gongcai, wake up!

00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:54.700
Gongcai.

00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:55.700
Gongcai!

00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:56.940
What's happening?

00:14:57.820 --> 00:14:58.860
Lin Yan, you...

00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:00.700
Shhh!

00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:03.340
Vice Prefect, please!

00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:05.100
A thief fled toward Yunshui Manor!

00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:06.540
We must search!

00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:09.020
Vice Prefect.

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:11.340
Vice Prefect!

00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:12.780
What are you doing?

00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:17.100
You dare ask?

00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:20.020
Vice Prefect, please!

00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:23.140
Caught traveling at night, huh?

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:25.380
Vice Prefect!

00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:28.100
What now?

00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:29.380
I can save you.

00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:31.020
But remember, you owe me.

00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:45.420
Apologies, everyone.

00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:47.700
Tonight, I was traveling outside

00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:48.860
and breaking curfew.

00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:53.380
Lady,

00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:54.500
that night traveler

00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:55.580
seemed like

00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:56.580
a man.

00:15:56.940 --> 00:15:58.180
The night is deep.

00:15:58.180 --> 00:15:59.620
Surely you misjudged, sir.

00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:00.740
It was me.

00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:02.580
I'm the Vice Prefect's cousin.

00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:04.460
Tonight, Vice Prefect was hungry.

00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:06.180
He's always particular.

00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:07.740
I went out

00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:09.900
hoping to find the night market.

00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:12.700
Sorry for the trouble.

00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:14.060
Lady, do you not know

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:15.740
that breaking curfew is a grave crime?

00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:17.580
I do. But Vice Prefect...

00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:19.380
Knowing violation increases the penalty!

00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:20.700
No! No...

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:22.900
I... didn't know! I misspoke!

00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:24.660
I'm new to Yong'an and unfamiliar...

00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:28.020
Vice Prefect.

00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:30.140
Apologies for troubling everyone.

00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:32.240
Patrolling at night
and encountering this...

00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:34.380
My cousin traveled

00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:35.220
for my sake,

00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:36.700
not willful violation.

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:38.380
She grew up

00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:39.820
where curfews were lax.

00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:41.660
She was new to Yong'an customs.

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:43.180
And

00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:44.220
a young lady

00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:45.940
could hardly cause trouble.

00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:47.960
Could we follow the law:

00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:48.940
pay a fine,

00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:50.260
pledge

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:51.580
no future offenses?

00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:53.140
Is that okay?

00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:56.620
If you say so,

00:16:57.460 --> 00:16:58.300
it...

00:16:58.860 --> 00:16:59.940
Thank you.

00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:01.780
Without you all,

00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:04.060
Yong'an wouldn't be this peaceful.

00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:26.850
My family and I

00:17:26.850 --> 00:17:28.380
never intended to harm you.

00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:29.980
Why did you try to kill us?

00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:35.220
You covered for me earlier

00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:37.420
only because you feared exposure.

00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:38.940
A dignified Vice Prefect

00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:40.220
sneaking around at night,

00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:42.260
your secret is clearly worse!

00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:44.820
But we truly saw you as...

00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:46.300
as family!

00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:47.860
We promised to take you back.

00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:49.380
Do you know how hard that is?

00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:50.740
Of course, it's hard.

00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:52.140
You spies were

00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:55.220
long abandoned by your masters.

00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:56.860
You could never take me back.

00:17:56.860 --> 00:17:57.700
Spies?

00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:00.100
You think we're spies

00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:01.660
planted near you?

00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:02.980
Aren't you?

00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:04.580
You're insane.

00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:05.660
Call those soldiers back

00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:07.140
and let them see what we are!

00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:09.300
My family's only plan

00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:10.740
was shelter

00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:11.580
and finding a way...

00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:14.060
home!

00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:16.140
Yesterday, you said
you'd return with us.

00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:17.220
We thought,

00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:18.660
however difficult,

00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:19.900
we'd try for you.

00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:21.380
Yet you suspect us of spying!

00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:22.540
What spy would offer

00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:23.620
to take you to their base?

00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:24.460
Answer that!

00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:28.380
Then earlier,

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.160
you said you didn't know
why you were "arranged" here.

00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:32.140
What does that mean?

00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:33.380
Who arranged it?

00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:34.660
What arrangement?

00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:36.420
Vice Prefect Lin,

00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:38.340
is it possible I meant

00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:40.380
"why did fate arrange this"?

00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:42.300
We didn't want to be stranded in Yong'an,
yet here we are.

00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:44.340
I don't know
why fate arranges things this way!

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:52.100
Then,

00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:53.540
how could you easily open

00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:55.340
that lock with Huoxun Kingdom numerals?

00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:57.420
Huoxun Kingdom numerals?

00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:01.620
Vice Prefect,

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:04.020
for the trade, we learn

00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:05.260
all counting methods.

00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:06.580
What's strange?

00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:08.060
I opened that lock by accident!

00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:08.980
Eight is homophonic

00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:10.060
for prosper.

00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:11.900
Is it difficult for merchants?

00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:13.500
Next time, if you need anything,

00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:14.460
ask on the spot!

00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:15.620
Don't invent

00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:17.020
Huoxun spy

00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:17.860
nonsense later!

00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:19.100
How could you think that up?

00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:22.940
The sow trotters...

00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:31.460
aren't done yet.

00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:32.540
I...

00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:36.020
Vice Prefect,

00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:38.780
please open your eyes.

00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:40.940
My brother was drugged unconscious,

00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:42.140
yet he snores on the spot.

00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:43.380
My dad...

00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:46.780
My dad follows my mom.

00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:49.020
My mom!
My niece, who's barely a few years old!

00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:51.540
Who here looks capable of opposing you?

00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:01.180
Liu Chang!

00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:03.060
Wake up!

00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:09.220
Liu Chang,

00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:10.380
why did you do this?

00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:12.900
Didn't you say that day?

00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:14.700
Eyes narrowed, gazing into the distance,

00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:16.260
"You handle the Shen family.

00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:17.900
Bury everything here."

00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:19.140
You told me!

00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:24.060
I meant bury the matter,

00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:25.660
not the family!

00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:26.580
Detain them somewhere,

00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:27.900
isn't that fine?

00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:28.860
Detain?

00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:32.260
Clearly, house arrest!

00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:34.580
Lin Yan, do you know
what we did tonight?

00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:36.740
Cooked a whole table of delicacies

00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:37.820
to thank you.

00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:38.740
For this meal,

00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:40.260
I marinated the meat
in the kitchen last night

00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:41.380
and wanted to surprise you.

00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:42.620
And you?

00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:44.700
Your conscience eaten by dogs?

00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:47.020
- Lady Shen...
- Shut up!

00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:48.420
Alright.

00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:12.660
I...

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:16.060
misunderstood
our Young Master's meaning.

00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:17.860
My deepest apologies.

00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:20.140
This is how you misunderstand?

00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:21.140
Your misunderstanding

00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:22.700
nearly buried my family alive!

00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:27.620
The misunderstanding was mine.

00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:30.740
Your anger is justified,

00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:32.140
but I must

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:33.900
still apologize.

00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:36.020
Young Master...

00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:40.900
Don't blame him!

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:41.720
It's all my fault.

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:42.990
Punishment, beating, or scolding,

00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:44.540
I accept it all!

00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:45.940
Sorry, Uncle!

00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:48.020
Sorry, Auntie! Sorry, Yangyang!

00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:50.020
Sorry, Lady Shen!

00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:51.700
Enough! Enough!

00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:52.660
Stop this!

00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:53.620
Vice Prefect, get up!

00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:55.140
- Okay, Vice Prefect.
- Fine.

00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:56.500
- I know.
- Okay. Fine.

00:21:57.060 --> 00:21:59.060
- Alright, alright.
- Get up first.

00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:01.780
It seems you two

00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:03.820
truly realize your wrongs.

00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:06.140
Let this matter pass.

00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:08.100
But Vice Prefect Lin,

00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:10.340
we do request your help.

00:22:10.810 --> 00:22:12.300
We'd like to rely on our family ties

00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:13.940
to stay here temporarily.

00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:16.020
We have zero ulterior motives.

00:22:16.170 --> 00:22:17.020
We also hope

00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:18.620
you will stop such suspicions.

00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:19.740
I'm truly sorry.

00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:23.380
Then... this is settled?

00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:24.500
Forget it, forget it.

00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:25.340
Forget it.

00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:26.320
- Here, Vice Prefect.
- Come.

00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:28.140
- Sit down.
- Improper.

00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:29.060
Listen to me!

00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:30.860
Come here.

00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:32.940
Sit down, Vice Prefect.

00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:36.780
Eat it! Yangyang, here.

00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:39.580
Starving.

00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:45.380
Liu Chang,

00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:47.420
eat it!

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.340
- This bamboo shoot is tasty.
- Not bad.

00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:50.620
Eat it.

00:22:56.420 --> 00:22:57.980
- Delicious!
- Eat more, Vice Prefect.

00:22:58.140 --> 00:22:59.100
Nourish your brain.

00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:13.780
Thank you, Lady Shen.

00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:20.180
Vice Prefect, I'll wash them.

00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:21.020
I'll wash them.

00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:23.660
Brother Shen, the fault was mine first.

00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:25.540
Such small tasks should be mine.

00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:27.020
No, this is my job.

00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:28.220
Plus, you're our...

00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:31.460
landlord!

00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:32.460
This isn't proper.

00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:33.580
- I'll do it.
- No need.

00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:35.300
Really, I insist.

00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:36.700
- No way.
- Improper.

00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:37.540
Stop arguing.

00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:39.340
Let my brother wash.

00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:40.650
Vice Prefect, please come with me.

00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:42.220
Go.

00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:43.860
Go. I'll handle this.

00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:49.180
Oh my, you're washing dishes for me?

00:23:49.180 --> 00:23:50.490
I don't want a shortened lifespan.

00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:08.860
This is a snack from Qingyang,

00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:09.700
rice tofu.

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:11.300
The process is complicated,

00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:12.420
and it's freshly made.

00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:15.020
Knowing you have had
a hard time these years,

00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:16.940
you must miss the taste of home.

00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:19.140
So I specially made this snack for you.

00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:31.300
You almost buried us alive.

00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:32.820
And we're still being so good to you.

00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:34.700
Aren't you touched?

00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:37.820
If you are touched,

00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:39.900
then next time,
don't do such wicked things.

00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:43.580
Sorry.

00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:48.580
What were you doing out at night?

00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:52.140
About some things,

00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:53.700
it's better to know less.

00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:55.460
Got it.

00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:57.100
I got it.

00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:16.580
Only people from Qingyang

00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:19.260
know how to make rice tofu.

00:25:21.090 --> 00:25:23.660
(Not necessarily.
People on the internet know too.)

00:25:24.180 --> 00:25:25.020
You said

00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:27.260
you wanted to go home,

00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:29.500
meaning back to Qingyang?

00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:33.300
Actually,

00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:37.580
our hometown isn't Qingyang either.

00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:40.220
We went to Qingyang later and met...

00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:41.180
your parents.

00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:43.620
Anyway, it was very circuitous.

00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:44.980
We couldn't settle down anywhere,

00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:46.300
and finally we came to Yong'an.

00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:49.180
But we still really want

00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:50.580
to go back to our real home.

00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:53.460
Don't worry.

00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:54.940
One day,

00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:56.260
we'll find a way.

00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:00.180
Enough talk, hurry up and eat it.

00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:01.700
It won't taste good if it sits too long.

00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:08.980
Rice tofu is mostly made savory,

00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:10.380
but I like it sweet,

00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:11.660
so I made yours sweet.

00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:38.980
In the past,

00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:42.660
my mother liked to make it sweet too.

00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:45.420
Over ten years,

00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:48.420
I can hardly remember its taste now.

00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:51.660
Your saying

00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:54.940
makes my heart soften.
I can't stay mad at you.

00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:04.580
Regarding today's events,

00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:06.380
it was truly my fault.

00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:07.940
I hope you can forgive me.

00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:12.980
Before he knew Lady Shen,

00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:17.180
his personality was
cold-blooded, ruthless, and merciless.

00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:20.300
He isn't really as vicious
as Grandpa said.

00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:22.220
What?

00:27:25.030 --> 00:27:26.780
I'm saying that
for a Vice Prefect like you,

00:27:26.780 --> 00:27:28.660
being willing to admit you're wrong
and willing to change

00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:29.780
is rare.

00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:31.970
Actually, seeing you like this,

00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:33.780
my family stopped being angry long ago.

00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:36.380
What about you?

00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:41.740
Then what about you?

00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:43.780
Do you trust the Shen family now?

00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:03.220
(Sushui City)

00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:05.660
(Prince Zhao's Mansion)

00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:08.780
(Prince Zhao)

00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:11.140
(Li Ang, Fourth Son of Prince Zhao)

00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:38.220
I won!

00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:41.020
Let me tell you,

00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:43.060
if Anran were here,

00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:45.180
this game of Chupu

00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:47.060
wouldn't have been
so easy for me to win.

00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:49.140
So boring!

00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:52.220
Dad, how many times

00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:54.020
have you mentioned Lin Yan?

00:28:56.580 --> 00:28:57.420
I think

00:28:57.820 --> 00:28:59.500
he must be your real son.

00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:02.580
You named him Yan,

00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:03.900
following the radical pattern

00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:05.300
used in our brothers' names.

00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:06.820
One day,

00:29:07.270 --> 00:29:08.990
we might as well
have him acknowledge his ancestors.

00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:11.140
If he really were my own son,

00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:12.380
that would actually be better.

00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:18.140
What about the letter you sent to Anran?

00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:19.980
You gave the order,

00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:21.420
how dare I disobey?

00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:24.660
The letter has probably arrived by now.

00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:32.980
(Gentle and Calm)

00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:33.940
Young Master.

00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:34.780
Young Master!

00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:37.420
This is from His Highness, Prince Zhao,

00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:38.660
written from Sushui City.

00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:40.260
But didn't His Highness say that

00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:41.900
since you entered the capital

00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:42.920
and gained His Majesty's favor,

00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:43.770
he should avoid suspicion

00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:44.860
and reduce

00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:45.980
this kind of correspondence?

00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:48.100
Perhaps there's something urgent.

00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:51.510
(I'm gratified
to hear it.)

00:29:51.510 --> 00:29:52.520
(She is first
to know the situation.)

00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:53.500
(Those close to her can also
know it.)

00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:54.620
Prince Zhao

00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:56.700
wants me to find a way
to get close to Princess Fuhui

00:29:56.700 --> 00:29:58.130
to find out about court developments.

00:29:58.540 --> 00:30:00.380
Princess Fuhui?

00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:01.980
Is that the one

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.390
whose consort fell off a cliff
and has been in a coma for over ten years?

00:30:04.390 --> 00:30:05.240
The one with the hobby

00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:08.260
of widely collecting close servants?

00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:09.540
Yes.

00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:10.860
But

00:30:11.460 --> 00:30:12.860
why would Prince Zhao suddenly

00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:14.420
care about court movements?

00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:17.400
His Highness has always cared
about the common people.

00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:19.500
Maybe he just...

00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:22.460
wants to care about it?

00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:23.660
By the way,

00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:25.470
last night I infiltrated
the Court of Judicial Review

00:30:25.470 --> 00:30:27.300
and looked at the files
from the Cui case.

00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:29.190
The evidence was solidly fabricated.

00:30:29.670 --> 00:30:30.600
The mastermind behind it

00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:32.100
must have deep roots in the court

00:30:32.460 --> 00:30:33.300
to pull that off.

00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:36.220
Then, aren't we in big trouble?

00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:38.060
Young Master,

00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:39.580
I observe that

00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:41.300
you always seem to hold something back

00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:42.660
from His Highness.

00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:44.060
You've never even mentioned

00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:45.780
our plans to overturn the case to him.

00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:46.980
At this point,

00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:48.380
don't you want

00:30:48.540 --> 00:30:50.140
to ask His Highness for help?

00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:52.500
Back then, when we fled the Cui family,

00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:53.340
wandering destitute,

00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:55.020
it was His Highness who lent a hand.

00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:56.260
We only survived because of him.

00:30:57.620 --> 00:30:58.980
His Highness has been kind
to both of us.

00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:01.380
I don't want

00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:02.740
to implicate him one day.

00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:05.520
The Fifth Master Xiao
mentioned in Dad's notes

00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:08.260
is probably the one
from the Princess's family.

00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:10.900
The Princess has
wide connections at court

00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:12.380
and is Fifth Master Xiao's wife.

00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:13.580
Getting close to her

00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:15.380
is bound to yield new clues.

00:31:18.860 --> 00:31:19.700
By the way,

00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:21.340
the Shen family

00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:22.950
complained that our kitchen cooking
is too plain

00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:24.600
and they couldn't get used to it.

00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:25.920
They insisted on cooking for themselves.

00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:27.180
I said that wouldn't do.

00:31:27.250 --> 00:31:28.420
They're such a strange family.

00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:29.620
If I let them into the kitchen,

00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:31.260
what if one day they poison

00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:32.180
our food?

00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:34.540
Lady Shen was right.

00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:35.580
They are indeed simpletons.

00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:37.080
They'd never be chosen as spies,

00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:38.140
no matter what.

00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:39.540
Besides, up until now,

00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:40.980
only I've hurt them.

00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:42.420
They truly haven't wronged me

00:31:42.420 --> 00:31:43.620
in the slightest.

00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:45.140
Then...

00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:47.220
do I still need to keep an eye on them?

00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:49.860
No need.

00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:52.180
Their rice tofu

00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:53.700
is very authentic.

00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:58.580
From now on,
they can use the kitchen freely.

00:31:58.910 --> 00:32:00.650
You go buy more ingredients, too.

00:32:07.220 --> 00:32:08.900
So fragrant.

00:32:09.650 --> 00:32:11.660
Choose a lamb with a good mix
of lean and fat meat,

00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:14.260
and simmer it slowly over low heat
for two full hours.

00:32:14.780 --> 00:32:17.220
Clear broth, tender meat,
and aroma wafting everywhere.

00:32:17.220 --> 00:32:18.780
This can absolutely be called

00:32:18.780 --> 00:32:20.380
a perfect pot

00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:21.620
of Spring Water Lamb!

00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:27.340
It's definitely not that perfect.

00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:28.340
Why?

00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:29.600
But I can prove it.

00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:31.720
This is absolutely
the best-tasting Spring Water Lamb

00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:33.180
your dad is capable of making.

00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:34.740
Want it to be better?

00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:36.180
Absolutely impossible.

00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:38.660
Honey, could you just

00:32:38.660 --> 00:32:40.540
occasionally praise me once?

00:32:41.620 --> 00:32:43.100
Alright, alright! Quick! Taste it!

00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:44.100
Everyone, taste it!

00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:46.860
Perfect! Dad is the best!

00:32:46.860 --> 00:32:47.700
Really?

00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:49.420
- Here, I'll pick you a piece.
- Tasty.

00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:51.140
Here.

00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:53.980
So, as long as we use this perfect pot
of Spring Water Lamb

00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:55.700
to move our ancestor

00:32:55.700 --> 00:32:56.780
on the full moon night,

00:32:57.020 --> 00:32:58.580
we can return to modern times?

00:32:59.860 --> 00:33:01.300
Most likely, yes.

00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:03.420
But the full moon night
is still several days away.

00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:04.300
How about

00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:05.820
we use this last bit of time

00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:06.740
to make some money?

00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:08.260
Good!

00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:09.420
When we came,

00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:10.540
weren't my gold jewelry

00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:11.820
and Yangyang's longevity lock

00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:13.180
all brought over?

00:33:13.180 --> 00:33:14.580
Then, the money we earn here,

00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:15.480
if we exchange it for gold,

00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:17.020
we can take it back, too?

00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:18.220
Absolutely, we can!

00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:20.300
Okay then! So tomorrow we'll continue...

00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:21.460
continue making

00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:22.340
- Jian...
- Bing...

00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:23.220
- Guo...
- Zi!

00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:24.140
Yeah.

00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:25.860
Yeah!

00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:31.120
(Shaoguang's Food Notes)

00:33:31.130 --> 00:33:32.440
(Let's see
the officials' canteen in Yong'an.)

00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:33.500
(Speaking of exploiting the ancestor,)

00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:34.640
(let me read you the daily ration
allocated to Vice Prefect Lin:)

00:33:34.650 --> 00:33:35.820
(2.2 sheng of fine rice
and 8 ge of non-glutinous rice.)

00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:36.770
(2.4 sheng of flour,
1.5 sheng of wine, and 4 fen of lamb.)

00:33:36.770 --> 00:33:37.840
(4 ge of sauce, 4 ge of vinegar,
and 3 melons.)

00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:39.200
(Salt, fermented beans, scallions,
ginger, mallow, leeks, etc.)

00:33:39.210 --> 00:33:40.300
(If he must attend the court,
he'll eat at the canteen at noon.)

00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:41.420
(Leaving one portion of rations behind.)

00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:42.710
(During festivals, the Emperor
bestows various sundries too.)

00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:44.120
(Since Vice Prefect Lin usually just
eats steamed buns, rice, and pickles,)

00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:46.530
(leaving it would be a waste.)

00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:50.220
(So we'll confiscate it all
to use for the shop.)
