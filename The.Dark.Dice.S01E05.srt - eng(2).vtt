WEBVTT

00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:02.201
She wasn’t just the reason
Kaen’s project got ruined,

00:00:02.244 --> 00:00:04.331
but she also told Kaen
to rig the election.

00:00:04.354 --> 00:00:08.154
Whether it’s the game or otherwise,
it all started with you, Mamay!

00:00:08.164 --> 00:00:10.019
Can you just, please, leave me alone?

00:00:10.041 --> 00:00:11.041
Kaen!

00:00:11.954 --> 00:00:15.204
So you stayed late playing with this dice?

00:00:15.325 --> 00:00:17.102
I must confiscate this for now.

00:00:17.204 --> 00:00:18.902
I’m actually looking into the game.

00:00:19.213 --> 00:00:20.379
The Board Game Club.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.100
It’s exactly like the game we played.

00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:25.168
Who is… Panyada?

00:00:25.205 --> 00:00:28.303
If we find Panyada,
we might know more about this dice.

00:00:29.143 --> 00:00:30.143
Aom.

00:00:36.383 --> 00:00:38.703
Is the game dead set on killing us all?

00:00:43.567 --> 00:00:44.896
Guys, look!

00:00:52.509 --> 00:00:53.431
How are we gonna get out of here?

00:00:53.444 --> 00:00:54.926
That thing is right in front of the door.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:56.002
What should we do, Aom?

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.610
I have a plan, but…

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:02.090
But what?

00:01:05.085 --> 00:01:06.602
We can’t all leave, Pan.

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.001
Someone has to stay behind.

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.899
The slowest person right now is…

00:01:19.902 --> 00:01:20.902
Aom!

00:01:47.629 --> 00:01:48.629
Aom.

00:01:48.751 --> 00:01:49.973
Wait a minute, love.

00:01:50.309 --> 00:01:52.703
I’m making your favorite,
stir-fried water spinach.

00:01:52.982 --> 00:01:55.173
It’s always best fresh off the pan,
don’t you think?

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.020
Yes, Mom.

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.848
Why don’t you call
your father down to breakfast?

00:02:08.417 --> 00:02:10.702
Tell him he can’t make it till lunch.

00:03:22.029 --> 00:03:23.900
Why did you gather us here, Mamay?

00:03:25.874 --> 00:03:27.702
I have something to announce.

00:03:28.432 --> 00:03:30.785
What is this announcement about,
Madam President?

00:03:30.942 --> 00:03:32.099
Oh, I forgot.

00:03:32.445 --> 00:03:33.730
You ain’t one no more.

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.798
Mamay and I have been
researching the dice game.

00:03:41.102 --> 00:03:42.102
Let me see.

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:47.503
The Board Game Club?

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:50.525
Is there even a club like that
at our school?

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:52.202
There was, 30 years ago.

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:54.668
The Board Game Club’s log book

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.503
is proof that someone
has played the game before us.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.000
Why is this table crossed out?

00:04:00.096 --> 00:04:03.401
If anyone can give us answers,
it’s Panyada.

00:04:04.177 --> 00:04:05.400
She wrote this book.

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.699
Mamay and I tried looking up Panyada
in the school’s yearbooks,

00:04:11.696 --> 00:04:13.097
but we found her page torn out

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.499
by none other than Aom.

00:04:16.468 --> 00:04:19.699
I’m sure Aom knows about this game
more than she lets on.

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:21.902
Why are you looking into this game?

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.302
Don’t tell me you want to play again.

00:04:26.225 --> 00:04:27.225
We do.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.202
In the log book, you can see that someone
did try to collect four medals,

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.045
which means the game
might really grant wishes.

00:04:36.503 --> 00:04:41.001
To restore Kaen’s project,
there is no other way to do it but this.

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.774
That is why I am asking
all of you to play again.

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:44.870
Are you out of your mind?

00:04:44.951 --> 00:04:46.499
There’s a punishment for losing.

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:47.899
Aren’t you afraid of that?

00:04:48.066 --> 00:04:49.826
Not to mention that
the dice got confiscated.

00:04:49.977 --> 00:04:51.899
We’re going to get it back.

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:55.752
If we don’t do this,
there’s no other way to help Kaen.

00:04:57.226 --> 00:04:59.170
Why would we help him

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:03.748
when this was all your fault
in the first place?

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:06.373
Hey.

00:05:06.751 --> 00:05:08.591
It’s kinda worth playing
if you think about it.

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:12.076
Even if the punishment is getting
our project destroyed like Kaen’s did,

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:16.001
but if we can ask for 10 or 100 million,
that’s totally worth it.

00:05:16.057 --> 00:05:18.998
What if the punishment isn’t just
getting your project destroyed?

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:21.152
There’s no way I’m in!

00:05:21.918 --> 00:05:22.918
We’re leaving, Mark.

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:29.190
Count me out.

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:31.002
If you’re dying to help Kaen,

00:05:31.722 --> 00:05:32.998
you gotta do it solo.

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:34.853
Don’t drag us along with you.

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:40.940
What he said.

00:05:43.887 --> 00:05:45.798
I’ll do it alone even if no one wants to.

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:48.100
Doesn’t the punishment scare you?

00:05:49.494 --> 00:05:50.894
I don’t think the game can hurt me.

00:05:51.401 --> 00:05:53.896
And if it can make Kaen’s wish come true,

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:55.680
I’m willing to take the risk.

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:00.539
What about you, Samut?

00:06:01.822 --> 00:06:03.300
Don’t you have a wish?

00:06:08.463 --> 00:06:09.463
I do.

00:06:12.103 --> 00:06:14.143
I’m just not sure if anything
can make it come true.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.314
Sir, I didn’t do it.

00:06:24.423 --> 00:06:27.004
I told you it was an accident.

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:31.401
That’s not what it looks like
in the video.

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:35.697
The only person who can tell us
if you’re telling the truth is Atom,

00:06:36.471 --> 00:06:38.497
and he’s still in a coma.

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:44.402
I appreciate that you’ve been
making a name for our school.

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:46.749
But if we don’t take any actions,

00:06:46.888 --> 00:06:49.328
we’ll be accused of playing favoritism
towards model students.

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:57.730
STUDENT WITHDRAWAL FORM

00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:59.120
I’m really sorry.

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:01.648
But to preserve our school’s reputation,

00:07:02.376 --> 00:07:04.091
this is unavoidable.

00:07:06.142 --> 00:07:07.142
Principal.

00:07:07.533 --> 00:07:08.114
Sir!

00:07:08.131 --> 00:07:09.131
Samut.

00:07:17.438 --> 00:07:18.497
Thank you.

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:25.160
What are you doing here?

00:07:27.807 --> 00:07:29.927
I told you countless times
not to show your face here.

00:07:31.265 --> 00:07:32.961
Ma’am, I...

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:35.460
Do you think I’d sympathize
with you if you keep showing up?

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:39.001
You made my son like this.

00:07:40.143 --> 00:07:42.294
Be grateful I didn’t have you locked up!

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:45.200
Leave.

00:07:46.413 --> 00:07:47.413
Leave!

00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:28.930
Boo!

00:08:30.622 --> 00:08:31.179
Mark!

00:08:31.365 --> 00:08:32.798
You spooked me!

00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:34.365
Did you have dinner?

00:08:34.478 --> 00:08:36.348
- Yes. Did you?
- Yes.

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:41.962
Mom.

00:08:41.983 --> 00:08:42.983
Hmm?

00:08:43.517 --> 00:08:45.400
Did you take on another accounting job?

00:08:47.008 --> 00:08:48.394
I told you, didn’t I?

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:51.151
I don’t want you working too much.

00:08:52.183 --> 00:08:53.447
I’m worried about you, Mom.

00:08:54.682 --> 00:08:55.682
I know that.

00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:57.952
But if I don’t work hard,

00:08:57.971 --> 00:09:00.691
and you spend all your money on girls,
what will be left of me, then?

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:01.950
No way!

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:04.920
There’s no way I’d love someone
more than I love you, Mom.

00:09:05.503 --> 00:09:06.503
You know that.

00:09:10.222 --> 00:09:11.600
I’m serious, Mom.

00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:14.500
I don’t want you to overwork.

00:09:15.762 --> 00:09:17.602
Your body just isn’t up for it.

00:09:19.428 --> 00:09:20.428
I’m worried about you.

00:09:23.165 --> 00:09:25.400
I promise not to work too much.

00:09:25.881 --> 00:09:26.881
Okay?

00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:27.777
You promise?

00:09:27.875 --> 00:09:28.875
I do.

00:09:29.014 --> 00:09:30.014
Okay.

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:35.117
Speaking of which!

00:09:36.001 --> 00:09:37.976
You need to slow down
playing around, lover boy.

00:09:38.287 --> 00:09:39.798
Mom! You keep bringing that up!

00:09:40.111 --> 00:09:41.111
Stop it already.

00:09:41.417 --> 00:09:42.417
Go.

00:09:42.442 --> 00:09:43.497
Just get to bed.

00:09:43.971 --> 00:09:44.971
Come on.

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:49.502
You’re always evading this topic, huh?

00:09:51.268 --> 00:09:52.502
You ready, bud?

00:09:53.171 --> 00:09:55.380
I can’t wait for some cold beer.

00:09:55.853 --> 00:09:56.853
Hold on.

00:09:56.887 --> 00:09:57.887
Let me make some money.

00:10:00.546 --> 00:10:01.546
Again?

00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:03.130
You’re doing that often these days.

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:06.080
How else would I buy you drinks otherwise?

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:07.742
YOU LOST.

00:10:07.771 --> 00:10:08.771
Crap!

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:10.853
Another loss, huh?

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:12.749
It’s alright. My treat today.

00:10:13.374 --> 00:10:14.065
Alright?

00:10:14.162 --> 00:10:15.162
Come on.

00:10:16.531 --> 00:10:17.060
Hey!

00:10:17.248 --> 00:10:18.296
Watch where you’re going!

00:10:18.604 --> 00:10:19.724
Stay out of my freaking way.

00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:21.850
Hey, Don.

00:10:22.008 --> 00:10:23.096
It’s been a while.

00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:24.810
Did you forget all about us?

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:26.480
Of course not.

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:27.896
I’ve just been busy.

00:10:29.222 --> 00:10:30.982
I’m pretty sure
there’s something you forgot.

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:33.493
Like the 50 grand you owed me.

00:10:33.731 --> 00:10:34.731
50 grand?

00:10:34.862 --> 00:10:35.862
Don!

00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:38.416
You have until next week.

00:10:39.275 --> 00:10:40.600
If you don’t pay up,

00:10:41.096 --> 00:10:45.103
I can’t guarantee your
and your buddy’s safety.

00:10:46.478 --> 00:10:47.478
Shit.

00:10:49.444 --> 00:10:50.097
Of course.

00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:51.888
I’ll give it back to you
as soon as possible.

00:10:51.912 --> 00:10:53.527
We have to go for now.

00:10:54.663 --> 00:10:55.663
Hey.

00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:57.630
Need a lift?

00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:00.500
I know quite well where you live.

00:11:01.077 --> 00:11:02.077
No, thanks.

00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:44.110
I didn’t know a star student like you
could do something like this.

00:11:45.485 --> 00:11:46.485
Samut!

00:11:46.702 --> 00:11:48.582
You scared me.
I thought you were a teacher.

00:11:49.048 --> 00:11:50.048
Did you find it?

00:11:50.536 --> 00:11:51.536
It’s locked.

00:11:53.884 --> 00:11:55.484
I remember it was around here somewhere.

00:11:59.859 --> 00:12:00.859
Here.

00:12:01.342 --> 00:12:02.400
Use the black one.

00:12:11.668 --> 00:12:12.668
It’s not here.

00:12:14.783 --> 00:12:16.700
But I remember the teacher
placing it there.

00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:19.376
Maybe he’s moved it.

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:21.102
What should we do?

00:12:21.454 --> 00:12:22.767
What are you two doing?

00:12:25.739 --> 00:12:28.097
Oh, uh, we…

00:12:29.635 --> 00:12:30.300
We...

00:12:30.327 --> 00:12:32.487
The Headmaster asked me
to get something from you, sir.

00:12:33.725 --> 00:12:37.200
He said he wanted the dice
you confiscated.

00:12:37.728 --> 00:12:39.402
I don’t have it with me anymore.

00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:41.601
Someone already came for it.

00:12:42.016 --> 00:12:43.016
Who?

00:12:43.122 --> 00:12:45.783
The boy in your friend group.

00:12:49.853 --> 00:12:52.013
How will you even get that much money
to pay them back?

00:12:53.681 --> 00:12:54.703
Your dad’s a cop, right?

00:12:55.167 --> 00:12:56.167
Can’t he help you?

00:12:56.522 --> 00:12:58.503
If Dad found out I gamble online,

00:12:58.810 --> 00:13:00.850
he’d kill me before those guys
ever get a chance to.

00:13:01.296 --> 00:13:03.001
We can’t let him know.

00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:04.600
You took the dice, didn’t you?

00:13:05.626 --> 00:13:06.502
What now?

00:13:06.573 --> 00:13:08.780
The teacher said a boy came
and took the dice away.

00:13:08.897 --> 00:13:10.601
I know it’s you two.

00:13:10.988 --> 00:13:13.401
Tell me where it is.

00:13:13.595 --> 00:13:15.497
Can you stop being insane for a sec?

00:13:15.562 --> 00:13:16.691
We didn’t take it!

00:13:16.795 --> 00:13:19.404
Why would we want it
when the game’s so dangerous?

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:22.053
It seems they’re telling the truth.

00:13:22.687 --> 00:13:24.902
If it’s not them, who took it?

00:13:28.908 --> 00:13:29.908
Maybe…

00:13:41.179 --> 00:13:43.551
Mark, did you take the dice?

00:13:50.819 --> 00:13:51.819
Yeah.

00:13:52.025 --> 00:13:53.025
I did.

00:13:53.503 --> 00:13:54.896
Why the hell did you take it?

00:13:55.011 --> 00:13:56.497
You said you didn’t want to play.

00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:58.620
Just like you, I wasn’t going
to play anymore,

00:14:00.291 --> 00:14:01.505
but Aom asked me to.

00:14:02.391 --> 00:14:03.902
You sneaked off to see Aom?

00:14:04.029 --> 00:14:05.789
Why is this the first time
I hear about this?

00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:07.370
I didn’t sneak off to see her.

00:14:08.014 --> 00:14:09.404
She came to see me.

00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:11.201
Aom came to see you?

00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:13.620
Why?

00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:26.430
Aom.

00:14:33.303 --> 00:14:34.663
What did you want to see me about?

00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:39.951
Do you remember you owe me
in the last game?

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:43.440
Oh.

00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:44.801
Of course, I do.

00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:47.054
Well…

00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:50.548
How would you like me to pay you back?

00:14:53.190 --> 00:14:54.700
I want to play the game again.

00:14:55.788 --> 00:14:58.771
I… want you to play with me.

00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:01.910
Play the game?

00:15:06.102 --> 00:15:08.801
I’m sorry, but I can’t help you.

00:15:10.588 --> 00:15:11.588
Why not?

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:14.376
The dice got confiscated by a teacher.

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:17.001
But even if it didn’t,

00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:20.896
no one wants to play it anymore
after what happened to Kaen.

00:15:21.681 --> 00:15:22.681
What happened to Kaen?

00:15:23.702 --> 00:15:25.398
His project got burned down.

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:28.097
The whole school knows about this.

00:15:31.712 --> 00:15:33.105
Samut was right.

00:15:35.285 --> 00:15:36.602
You don’t go to our school.

00:15:39.644 --> 00:15:40.644
Whatever.

00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:42.300
I don’t care anyway.

00:15:44.047 --> 00:15:45.182
I trust you.

00:15:49.542 --> 00:15:50.801
You do?

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:52.330
Of course.

00:15:52.983 --> 00:15:54.380
If you wanted to hurt me,

00:15:55.630 --> 00:15:57.350
you wouldn’t have saved me
in the last game.

00:15:57.474 --> 00:15:58.474
Right?

00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:05.647
But speaking of which,

00:16:06.466 --> 00:16:08.202
I actually want to play the game again.

00:16:09.597 --> 00:16:11.798
I wanna find out if it really
does grant wishes.

00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:14.140
It does.

00:16:15.705 --> 00:16:17.297
It really does grant wishes.

00:16:19.072 --> 00:16:20.170
How’d you know that?

00:16:21.663 --> 00:16:23.397
Because I’ve played before.

00:16:24.841 --> 00:16:27.146
I can help you make
all your desires come true.

00:16:29.546 --> 00:16:30.702
What do you mean?

00:16:31.502 --> 00:16:33.297
I’ll help you win the game.

00:16:33.742 --> 00:16:35.422
All you have to do is get the dice for me,

00:16:36.536 --> 00:16:38.502
and we can play it together,
just the two of us.

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:40.247
Just the two of us?

00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:44.002
The chances of winning are higher
with fewer players.

00:16:44.437 --> 00:16:45.437
Don’t you think?

00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:50.900
Aom said she wanted to play
with just the two of you?

00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:55.100
But Aom has always been against
playing the game.

00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:57.580
Why would she suddenly ask you to play?

00:16:58.210 --> 00:16:59.601
Where is the dice right now?

00:17:01.017 --> 00:17:02.200
I gave it to Aom.

00:17:03.659 --> 00:17:05.179
You can get in contact with her, then?

00:17:05.314 --> 00:17:06.314
I can’t, actually.

00:17:06.986 --> 00:17:08.902
I asked for both
her Facebook and Instagram,

00:17:10.056 --> 00:17:11.269
but she wouldn’t tell me.

00:17:11.297 --> 00:17:12.297
Mark!

00:17:14.425 --> 00:17:18.000
Did she say anything else
after you gave her the dice?

00:17:20.450 --> 00:17:22.570
She told me to meet up for the game
on Sunday evening…

00:17:23.352 --> 00:17:24.352
At the old gymnasium.

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:26.700
Mark, don’t go.

00:17:27.090 --> 00:17:29.202
You know how dangerous the game is.

00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:32.060
I haven't actually decided if I will.

00:17:33.468 --> 00:17:34.748
If Aom is playing, then so am I.

00:17:35.217 --> 00:17:37.002
That makes two players.

00:17:37.374 --> 00:17:39.097
Then you have all the players you need.

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:40.545
Mark and I won’t play.

00:17:41.863 --> 00:17:42.863
Let’s go.

00:17:49.755 --> 00:17:51.302
I’m going to be here on Sunday.

00:17:51.884 --> 00:17:54.094
The rest of you can decide for yourself.

00:17:54.831 --> 00:17:56.600
I know you have your own reasons.

00:18:06.782 --> 00:18:07.782
Mom.

00:18:08.013 --> 00:18:09.448
What’s for dinner?

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:36.720
PIE: DON’T PLAY THE GAME, MARK.
I’M WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:52.170
DON’T PLAY THE GAME, MARK.
I’M WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:08.170
MAMAY: I’M SORRY, KAEN. I PROMISE
I’LL MAKE EVERYTHING RIGHT AGAIN.

00:19:44.659 --> 00:19:45.659
Samut.

00:19:48.442 --> 00:19:50.200
Don. Benz.

00:19:50.650 --> 00:19:52.088
Are you two joining, too?

00:19:52.192 --> 00:19:53.700
Can’t we?

00:19:54.350 --> 00:19:55.870
Are you planning to hog all the glory?

00:19:56.670 --> 00:19:57.670
Mark.

00:19:58.105 --> 00:19:59.105
Mark!

00:20:00.426 --> 00:20:01.920
Mark, please think again.

00:20:01.942 --> 00:20:03.374
I’m really worried about you.

00:20:04.348 --> 00:20:05.508
I’ve thought it through, Pie.

00:20:06.514 --> 00:20:08.503
You can go home if you want.

00:20:09.364 --> 00:20:10.364
I understand.

00:20:14.001 --> 00:20:15.001
Kaen?

00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:17.903
What are you doing here?

00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:19.398
It’s my project.

00:20:19.986 --> 00:20:21.200
So it’s my responsibility.

00:20:22.157 --> 00:20:23.503
I don’t need anyone’s help.

00:20:28.693 --> 00:20:29.902
What are you all doing here?

00:20:31.182 --> 00:20:33.002
I told you we’d play alone.

00:20:33.223 --> 00:20:35.100
What do you mean by “play alone”?

00:20:35.339 --> 00:20:36.804
Why can’t we join, too?

00:20:39.527 --> 00:20:41.000
Do you have something to hide?

00:20:42.069 --> 00:20:43.500
No, I don’t.

00:20:43.776 --> 00:20:45.941
You were hiding the fact that
you’ve played the game before.

00:20:45.965 --> 00:20:46.965
I wasn’t hiding that.

00:20:47.345 --> 00:20:48.705
You just never asked.

00:20:50.228 --> 00:20:52.600
Why did you suddenly want to play

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:55.702
when you were stopping us
from rolling the dice before?

00:20:57.051 --> 00:20:58.201
What’s strange about that?

00:20:58.709 --> 00:21:01.102
You all have your wishes,

00:21:01.503 --> 00:21:02.598
and so do I.

00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:05.245
Instead of interrogating me,

00:21:05.493 --> 00:21:09.099
you should all be asking yourself
if you’re willing to take the risk.

00:21:10.550 --> 00:21:12.179
It’s not too late to back off.

00:21:14.790 --> 00:21:17.100
I’ve made my decision. I’ll play.

00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:18.270
Same here.

00:21:21.463 --> 00:21:23.299
If Mark is going to play it, I will, too.

00:21:24.139 --> 00:21:25.730
Don’t say I didn’t warn you.

00:22:03.845 --> 00:22:08.997
Welcome, all eight players,
to Djehuty, the game of wits,

00:22:09.186 --> 00:22:11.702
where all your desires will come true.

00:22:17.170 --> 00:22:18.395
If we have four medals,

00:22:18.690 --> 00:22:20.130
and place them here on the platform,

00:22:20.696 --> 00:22:22.198
we can make a wish, can’t we?

00:22:26.530 --> 00:22:27.530
Yes.

00:22:28.625 --> 00:22:30.198
That’s freaking cool!

00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:31.600
I’ll ask for 10 million.

00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:34.840
100 million, actually.

00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:37.463
Maybe we’ll die before we even
get to make a wish.

00:22:37.875 --> 00:22:39.198
It’s not going to be that bad, Pie.

00:22:39.222 --> 00:22:40.263
Stop overthinking.

00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:45.388
All eight players, get ready for the game.

00:23:23.797 --> 00:23:24.797
Are we…

00:23:25.734 --> 00:23:27.499
in a hotel?

00:23:37.995 --> 00:23:38.995
Don.

00:23:39.302 --> 00:23:40.402
There’s some dice here.

00:23:46.096 --> 00:23:47.096
Dice?

00:23:47.478 --> 00:23:48.478
What are they for?

00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:51.648
I think it’s similar to the last game.

00:23:52.697 --> 00:23:54.400
Each color for each of us.

00:23:58.195 --> 00:23:59.902
The Pilgrimage.

00:24:00.394 --> 00:24:05.102
Players are assigned as Pilgrims,
heading towards the Gate of Heaven.

00:24:06.131 --> 00:24:08.801
You will go through obstacles
to test your faith.

00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:12.097
Each player will receive one
ten-sided dice in their own color,

00:24:12.244 --> 00:24:14.748
which will be used for rolling
in order to make a move.

00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:18.647
“Make a move?”

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:24.093
The first player to arrive at
the Gate of Heaven wins the game.

00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:28.220
That’s it?

00:24:28.848 --> 00:24:29.848
Should be easy enough.

00:24:30.906 --> 00:24:32.598
There are likely more rules.

00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:34.300
Like in the previous two games.

00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:36.960
But we gotta pick our dice anyway, right?

00:24:37.466 --> 00:24:38.466
I’ll go first.

00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:08.020
If you really have played the game before,

00:25:08.718 --> 00:25:10.010
what does this symbol mean?

00:25:12.210 --> 00:25:13.496
It’s the difficulty level.

00:25:14.810 --> 00:25:16.650
The more stars, the more difficult
the game is.

00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:18.949
And it comes with different prizes.

00:25:19.970 --> 00:25:21.705
So the last game
was harder than this one?

00:25:22.884 --> 00:25:24.798
It doesn’t mean this one will be easy.

00:25:26.842 --> 00:25:28.200
What do we do with our dice?

00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:32.040
The dice…

00:25:33.277 --> 00:25:34.700
I think it’s supposed to go here.

00:26:00.362 --> 00:26:01.362
A card?

00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:21.430
I can open it now.

00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:26.102
So we roll our dice to exchange for
a keycard to enter a room?

00:26:27.139 --> 00:26:30.299
That means each room is like
a square on a game board.

00:26:31.351 --> 00:26:32.702
Like in Monopoly?

00:26:35.008 --> 00:26:37.397
Let’s roll ours.

00:26:57.379 --> 00:26:59.496
Damn it. Last place?

00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:57.697
Is this the plan of the building, Kaen?

00:27:58.540 --> 00:28:00.798
What are these dots?

00:28:02.967 --> 00:28:06.600
I think it indicates who is in which room.

00:28:47.488 --> 00:28:50.902
Players, balance the scale.

00:28:51.339 --> 00:28:55.998
The player who is first to balance
their scale wins the game.

00:28:57.454 --> 00:28:58.647
I think we have to compete.

00:29:02.177 --> 00:29:03.202
Let’s play, then.

00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:17.400
Oh?

00:29:17.790 --> 00:29:19.630
The weights aren’t coordinating
with the sizes?

00:30:03.168 --> 00:30:04.168
I’m done.

00:30:05.885 --> 00:30:07.170
How did you do that?

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.840
The weights aren’t coordinating
with the sizes,

00:30:11.131 --> 00:30:12.179
but with the colors.

00:30:16.274 --> 00:30:17.274
Game over.

00:30:17.392 --> 00:30:19.703
Claim your prize in the hall.

00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:20.840
“Prize”?

00:30:25.127 --> 00:30:26.127
Let’s go.

00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:36.348
So the winner gets two coins,

00:30:37.077 --> 00:30:38.602
while the loser only gets one.

00:30:39.810 --> 00:30:41.290
Maybe the coins are for this machine.

00:31:03.130 --> 00:31:04.130
A dice?

00:31:11.811 --> 00:31:12.811
How was yours?

00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:14.440
Was it difficult?

00:31:16.051 --> 00:31:17.051
How was it?

00:31:17.457 --> 00:31:19.577
There was a game for us
to compete against each other.

00:31:19.651 --> 00:31:20.651
I won.

00:31:21.241 --> 00:31:22.241
Pie lost.

00:31:23.170 --> 00:31:24.454
I was in the room alone,

00:31:24.872 --> 00:31:26.800
and there was a puzzle.

00:31:27.454 --> 00:31:30.097
So every room has its own minigame.

00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:31.647
The game was really difficult, Aom.

00:31:32.090 --> 00:31:33.410
I couldn’t complete mine in time.

00:31:34.450 --> 00:31:37.128
Well, you’re all muscles.
Maybe the brain isn’t working properly.

00:31:37.417 --> 00:31:38.167
Don, you bastard.

00:31:38.248 --> 00:31:39.303
Stop fighting!

00:31:39.687 --> 00:31:41.001
We need to finish this game.

00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:47.245
Did you all get a dice as your prize?

00:31:48.976 --> 00:31:49.662
I did.

00:31:49.954 --> 00:31:50.977
I got one, too.

00:31:51.050 --> 00:31:52.294
Me, too.

00:31:52.730 --> 00:31:55.499
Besides the ten-sided dice,
I also got another weird-looking one.

00:31:55.783 --> 00:31:56.783
Look.

00:32:00.576 --> 00:32:01.576
Ladder?

00:32:03.087 --> 00:32:04.303
Why don’t you try and roll it?

00:32:07.521 --> 00:32:08.521
Get outta my way.

00:32:12.911 --> 00:32:13.911
Crap.

00:32:25.628 --> 00:32:26.628
What now?

00:32:26.714 --> 00:32:28.297
Try rolling your normal dice.

00:32:33.817 --> 00:32:36.497
Player, insert card
to update your progression.

00:32:42.931 --> 00:32:45.063
Wrong card inserted.

00:32:45.976 --> 00:32:46.976
It’s not working.

00:32:47.783 --> 00:32:49.183
Maybe you can’t use this card here.

00:32:50.333 --> 00:32:51.500
Try inserting the keycard.

00:32:58.471 --> 00:32:59.471
Holy crap!

00:32:59.924 --> 00:33:03.979
This means we need to toss our dice here
to update our keycard.

00:33:04.536 --> 00:33:06.297
So if you have two dice,

00:33:06.850 --> 00:33:08.300
you’ll proceed faster.

00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:11.380
Yes.

00:33:12.321 --> 00:33:15.602
Winning the minigame gives you a higher
chance of completing the game, too.

00:33:15.930 --> 00:33:17.300
Don, you try it.

00:33:17.810 --> 00:33:18.810
Go on.

00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:36.137
I got Room 12.

00:33:36.222 --> 00:33:37.299
Which room did you get?

00:33:37.602 --> 00:33:38.602
Room 11.

00:33:39.773 --> 00:33:43.597
So everyone, except for Benz,
is proceeding to the second floor.

00:33:44.311 --> 00:33:45.311
Let’s hurry up.

00:33:47.642 --> 00:33:49.801
What the hell? I’m in last place?

00:33:50.638 --> 00:33:51.638
Catch up, bud.

00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:35.596
The order of the room numbers on this floor
is different from the first floor.

00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:36.620
You’re right.

00:34:37.081 --> 00:34:39.204
It goes from left to right
on the first floor.

00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:42.045
But it’s right-to-left on this floor.

00:34:42.948 --> 00:34:43.948
Who cares about that?

00:34:44.650 --> 00:34:46.930
We have to enter the room
according to the keycard anyway.

00:34:47.986 --> 00:34:49.297
Let’s just go for now.

00:34:59.474 --> 00:35:00.697
I’ll see you soon, Pie.

00:35:04.838 --> 00:35:05.838
Where are you going?

00:35:07.625 --> 00:35:09.103
I have the keycard to Room 11.

00:35:09.327 --> 00:35:10.687
Where else do you think I’m going?

00:35:10.949 --> 00:35:12.402
You planned this, didn’t you?

00:35:12.786 --> 00:35:14.706
You made sure you rolled
the same number as Mark.

00:35:14.773 --> 00:35:16.400
Can dice be controlled like that?

00:35:17.230 --> 00:35:18.870
Take the jealousy down a notch, will you?

00:35:21.961 --> 00:35:23.350
Pie, come on.

00:35:23.982 --> 00:35:25.201
It’s just a coincidence.

00:35:51.651 --> 00:35:57.499
The ladder card connects the player to
the room above or below the one you’re in.

00:35:58.139 --> 00:36:01.300
Please choose the room on the diagram.

00:36:35.453 --> 00:36:36.453
Holy crap!

00:36:49.874 --> 00:36:50.874
Wow.

00:36:52.463 --> 00:36:53.610
Surprise!

00:36:55.725 --> 00:36:57.579
I caught up with ya!

00:37:02.755 --> 00:37:04.100
Did you use the ladder card?

00:37:04.377 --> 00:37:05.577
How the hell did he know that?

00:37:08.899 --> 00:37:09.899
The ladder card.

00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:12.204
Let’s just keep playing.

00:37:12.423 --> 00:37:14.303
I need to win so I can roll my dice.

00:37:20.910 --> 00:37:23.045
There was no ladder symbol here before.

00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:25.100
What does the red light mean?

00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:29.056
Damn it. I was so close!

00:37:29.983 --> 00:37:31.757
If only I was a little faster.

00:37:33.165 --> 00:37:34.660
When did you get on this floor?

00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:36.749
Curious, aren’t ya?

00:37:37.475 --> 00:37:39.002
The ladder card.

00:37:40.405 --> 00:37:41.000
Again?

00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:42.205
How did they all know?

00:37:43.710 --> 00:37:46.190
What I really want to know is
what happened on the first floor?

00:37:46.377 --> 00:37:48.195
Why did it turn red on the diagram?

00:37:49.425 --> 00:37:51.200
Did something strange happen
when you left?

00:37:52.816 --> 00:37:53.816
How’d I know that?

00:37:54.069 --> 00:37:55.903
There was nothing when I entered the room.

00:37:58.010 --> 00:38:00.496
All players are accounted for.

00:38:00.931 --> 00:38:02.611
The card exchange machine
is now available.

00:38:06.491 --> 00:38:11.902
Players can exchange two dice for
a ladder card or a snake card.

00:38:12.530 --> 00:38:14.048
A ladder card or a snake card?

00:38:17.112 --> 00:38:18.496
From these two symbols,

00:38:18.890 --> 00:38:21.595
and the sequence of the numbers on
the first and second floors,

00:38:22.522 --> 00:38:24.642
I think this game is like the game
Snakes and Ladders.

00:38:25.865 --> 00:38:26.865
Snakes and Ladders.

00:38:27.149 --> 00:38:30.496
So if a ladder card can bring
Benz to the upper floor,

00:38:31.168 --> 00:38:33.408
a snake card can likely place someone
on the lower floor.

00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:36.598
So snakes cards are for
slowing others down?

00:38:36.805 --> 00:38:38.502
We still need two dice to get it.

00:38:39.730 --> 00:38:41.797
I lost to Aom just now
so I don’t have enough dice.

00:38:42.211 --> 00:38:44.094
I also have only one dice.

00:38:44.272 --> 00:38:45.343
I have two.

00:38:45.712 --> 00:38:48.690
But if I exchange them, I won’t have
a dice to roll for the next turn.

00:38:49.232 --> 00:38:50.700
So no one can exchange anything?

00:38:50.906 --> 00:38:51.948
Why are we wasting our time, then?

00:38:51.970 --> 00:38:52.970
Let’s go.

00:39:10.634 --> 00:39:12.097
I’m off to the third floor, guys.

00:39:12.331 --> 00:39:13.331
Catch up.

00:39:13.897 --> 00:39:14.897
Bye.

00:39:17.623 --> 00:39:20.376
So only Mamay and Benz
get to go to the third floor?

00:39:23.660 --> 00:39:26.580
If I got a 10 when I rolled, I might have
made it to the third floor, too.

00:39:26.997 --> 00:39:28.401
I’m up against you this time, then?

00:39:31.034 --> 00:39:32.497
That’s almost too easy.

00:39:33.134 --> 00:39:34.134
You sure talk big.

00:39:46.783 --> 00:39:47.783
What’s this?

00:39:49.456 --> 00:39:54.004
The player that shoots more balls
into the merry-go-round wins.

00:39:56.537 --> 00:39:59.798
Too bad you’re up against someone
who’s on the basketball team.

00:40:00.269 --> 00:40:01.949
Save your gloat for when you actually win.

00:40:12.213 --> 00:40:13.213
Yes!

00:40:28.456 --> 00:40:29.004
Hey!

00:40:29.077 --> 00:40:30.077
What the hell did you do?

00:40:39.108 --> 00:40:40.108
Game over.

00:40:40.425 --> 00:40:42.674
Claim your prize in the hall.

00:40:42.712 --> 00:40:43.776
You jerk! You cheated!

00:40:44.782 --> 00:40:45.782
Cheat, my ass.

00:40:46.023 --> 00:40:47.201
A win is a win.

00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:50.000
Where do you think you’re going, bastard?
Come back here!

00:40:55.880 --> 00:40:57.595
I got the same room as you, Aom.

00:41:00.816 --> 00:41:02.502
So you’re all going to the third floor.

00:41:03.374 --> 00:41:05.598
Mark and Don aren’t here yet.

00:41:06.202 --> 00:41:07.202
Don, you jerk!

00:41:07.453 --> 00:41:08.453
You didn’t win.

00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:09.299
You cheated!

00:41:09.503 --> 00:41:11.801
If the game thinks I cheated,
would it have given me two dice?

00:41:11.814 --> 00:41:13.502
Show some sportsmanship, will ya?

00:41:13.668 --> 00:41:14.920
I’m getting you back for this!

00:41:14.962 --> 00:41:16.296
Mark, calm down.

00:41:16.450 --> 00:41:18.300
You can still win in the end.

00:41:21.660 --> 00:41:22.660
Get out of the way.

00:41:29.580 --> 00:41:31.260
You think you’d get ahead of me with that?

00:41:31.512 --> 00:41:32.629
I feel sorry for you.

00:41:33.650 --> 00:41:35.053
You suck but don’t even know it.

00:41:35.070 --> 00:41:36.070
You bastard!

00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:36.925
What you gonna do!

00:41:36.940 --> 00:41:37.685
What, huh?

00:41:37.715 --> 00:41:39.174
- Come at me!
- Shut the hell up!

00:41:39.195 --> 00:41:39.762
You jerk!

00:41:39.875 --> 00:41:41.795
- You guys, calm down!
- Stay out of my business!

00:41:44.502 --> 00:41:45.502
What’s happening?

00:41:53.342 --> 00:41:54.342
Guys, look!

00:42:06.862 --> 00:42:08.004
Go to the third floor!

00:42:16.287 --> 00:42:16.810
Crap!

00:42:17.048 --> 00:42:18.200
What the hell just happened?

00:42:20.487 --> 00:42:21.650
What’s the matter?

00:42:21.921 --> 00:42:23.703
The–The building was crumbling.

00:42:23.828 --> 00:42:24.828
This building?

00:42:24.970 --> 00:42:25.694
Don’t be funny.

00:42:25.890 --> 00:42:26.515
It’s true.

00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:28.153
- I saw it with my own eyes.
- They’re right.

00:42:28.177 --> 00:42:29.602
The floor just came crashing down.

00:42:37.161 --> 00:42:38.161
What is it, Samut?

00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:40.598
It didn’t just happen.

00:42:41.282 --> 00:42:42.598
It’s the design.

00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:44.600
Look.

00:42:45.197 --> 00:42:48.398
The first time we saw the first floor
marked red was after the second turn.

00:42:49.161 --> 00:42:52.299
The second floor is now marked red
after the fourth turn.

00:42:54.367 --> 00:42:56.502
It’s possible that, at every two turns,

00:42:57.420 --> 00:42:58.580
each floor will crumble down.

00:42:59.740 --> 00:43:01.696
I told you this game is dangerous!

00:43:02.190 --> 00:43:03.580
It really is going to kill us!

00:43:04.786 --> 00:43:07.696
You knew it would be dangerous,
didn’t you?

00:43:08.151 --> 00:43:09.200
And I did warn you.

00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:11.000
You all insisted on playing.

00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:12.602
Why are you making a ruckus now?

00:43:13.445 --> 00:43:15.404
If you want to blame someone,
blame yourself.

00:43:15.752 --> 00:43:17.800
There’s no use in fighting right now.

00:43:18.259 --> 00:43:20.059
Let’s just keep playing
so we can finish this.

00:43:32.250 --> 00:43:35.400
It’s strange that you know how dangerous
the game is but still want to play.

00:43:36.170 --> 00:43:37.202
What exactly do you want?

00:43:37.758 --> 00:43:39.496
I have a wish to make.

00:43:39.580 --> 00:43:40.580
I told you that.

00:43:40.617 --> 00:43:41.700
Does it concern Mark?

00:43:45.296 --> 00:43:46.402
What are you saying?

00:43:48.170 --> 00:43:50.250
Everyone can see that
you’re trying to approach Mark.

00:43:50.632 --> 00:43:51.632
What are you planning?

00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:56.100
What I do is none of your business.

00:43:57.670 --> 00:43:59.054
You guys going into that room?

00:44:01.050 --> 00:44:02.050
Good luck with that.

00:44:16.937 --> 00:44:18.600
What do you think Benz means?

00:44:20.075 --> 00:44:21.496
What is in this room?

00:44:22.670 --> 00:44:24.051
I just got here as well.

00:44:24.274 --> 00:44:25.274
How’d I know that?

00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:27.880
So you’ve never played
this game in particular?

00:44:28.580 --> 00:44:30.097
The game changes as it pleases.

00:44:30.180 --> 00:44:31.180
You know that.

00:44:32.838 --> 00:44:35.103
So what kind of games have you played?

00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:42.240
Aom!

00:44:45.155 --> 00:44:46.202
Let’s just play.

00:45:22.202 --> 00:45:23.202
Snake?

00:45:24.488 --> 00:45:25.580
How is that possible?

00:45:26.543 --> 00:45:27.543
The snake card.

00:45:28.527 --> 00:45:31.351
Benz was in this room and must have used
the snake card before he left.

00:45:33.980 --> 00:45:35.703
That means we’re on the second floor.

00:45:37.150 --> 00:45:38.251
But outside…

00:45:43.317 --> 00:45:44.451
We can’t leave.

00:46:11.869 --> 00:46:13.405
What happens
if we can’t leave this place?

00:46:13.429 --> 00:46:14.429
I don’t know!

00:46:14.980 --> 00:46:17.208
If this is the case,
shall we work together?

00:46:17.350 --> 00:46:18.910
How can I trust you not to cheat again?

00:46:20.130 --> 00:46:21.367
Benz, why did you do that!

00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:23.001
I got Room 70,

00:46:23.310 --> 00:46:25.110
which is right underneath
the room they’re in.

00:46:25.240 --> 00:46:26.450
I’ll buy you some time.

00:46:27.085 --> 00:46:28.450
Why are you helping us, Kaen?

00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:29.804
I just don’t want Don to win.

00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:33.502
What should we do?

00:46:34.394 --> 00:46:35.853
Kaen is going to be stuck here.
