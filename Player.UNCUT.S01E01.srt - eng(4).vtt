Are you okay, Miss Punnakorn?

Yeah...

Thank you for being here today.

He's helped me out a lot.

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:57.240
"2 years or 20 years, it doesn't mean you can trust him, right?"

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.560
Yeah, I've learned my lesson.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.560
And now, I really want to know...

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.080

This is the consequence of abandoning your friend to live abroad.

“Abroad. America. New York…”

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:23.400
“The city that has everything.”
“Fashion, City of Lights, food, nature…”

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:29.280
“art, museums, art fairs, galleries, Broadway.”
“This is it. My dream city.”

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.159
“That's why I chose to study the designing here.”

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:34.840
“And for the other reason...”

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.520
I caused some trouble with my older sister.

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.800
But that's not the point.

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.880
For now, the most important thing is Phetai.

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:44.520
Pun, marry me.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.640
What are you talking about?

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.520
Come on, we'll get married in name only.

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:53.960
You want citizenship, don't you?

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.440
This is the fastest way.

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.400
“This is Phetai.”

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.480
“He's partnered with a friend named Ohm.”

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:03.680
“They opened a small restaurant in Brooklyn.”
“Called ‘Let's Eat Thai’.”

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.200
“Two years ago, a friend introduced me to Phetai.”

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.560
“He came to New York when he was young.”

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.560
“He married an American woman and got his citizenship...”

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.000
“before they divorced almost 10 years ago.”

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
“And he rents out a room in his place for Thai students.”

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.960
What about my room?

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.600
“And I came to share a room with Phe...”

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.480
“Who would have thought that suddenly...”

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:26.040
“a landlord…”

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.480
“would become my husband-to-be.”

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.600
We'll register our marriage.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.760
Once you get your green card and citizenship...

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.080
we can just get a divorce.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.600
I know that this kind of method exists.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.080
But...

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.240
Will it really be okay?

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:49.960
It'll be fine...

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:51.080
if we're convincing enough.

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.080
Come on, trust me.

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.320
It's better than you marrying some random guy...

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:59.600
That you don't even know.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.280
How can you just trust someone like that?

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:03.120
Right?

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.720
But here's the thing, Pun...

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.840
There are some expenses for it.

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.120
A million baht!?

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.960
That's a million, Pun!

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.960
Yeah, that's why I'm so anxious!

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.960
And you know what's important...

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.960
It's the money Prang gave me when I graduated.

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.960

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:25.720

Or if there's anything I can do to help...

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.600
just tell me.

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.240

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:42.760
and you're spacing out again.

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.680
No, I'm not. It's just...…

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.280

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:02.080
Not yet. I just left the office.

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:04.520

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:07.000

“that Phe guy must have gotten into trouble again.”

00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:31.720
Yeah, that's it. Eat!

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:32.600
Eat up...

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:33.280
Is it good?

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:38.600
Dad, have you heard from Pun lately?

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:41.440
No, I haven't.

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:44.080
What about you, Prang?

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:45.680
Have you spoken to your sister?

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:47.080
Not at all.

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:49.200
Last time was when she
graduated with her master's.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.560
But her birthday is next month.

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:54.920
Should we invite her back here?

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:57.000
Absolutely, great.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.080
Miss her.

00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:00.400
She's probably busy looking for a job.

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:02.560
But I'll talk to her.

00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:05.840
Excuse me…

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:07.600
Oh, you're here…

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.360
Hello, dad.

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:14.080
- Hello, mom.
- Hello, dear.

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:16.640
I brought some snacks for you.

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:18.320
Thank you.

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:20.600
Well, my favorite girl.

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:22.480
There are two girls here, dad.

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:23.920
I'm hurt a bit now.

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:25.880
What is this?

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:28.880
Did I come too early?

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.120
Not at all, dear.

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:32.840
If you're ready, you can go.

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:34.200
Well then, I'll be going.

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:35.040
Okay, dear.

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:35.680
Goodbye.

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:36.560
Bye bye.

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:40.080
Jay...

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:41.880
Don't cause any more trouble.

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:44.800
Text me when you're at the condo.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:45.520
Goodbye.

00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:46.960
- Bye-bye, dear.
- Bye-bye.

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:51.400
Are you going to invite Ploy?

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:53.800
I heard she already has plans.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.080
Besides…

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:56.800
This is our date.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.800
I was just asking.

00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:01.640
When we go there...

00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:03.400
Ploy is always there too.

00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:04.840
Okay...

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:07.840
Wait a minute...

00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:11.200
You said you weren't jealous anymore.

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:14.920
I am not.

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:18.360
Really?

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:20.800
Mmm-hmm...

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:24.360
I don't believe you.

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:28.880
I'm not...

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:32.600
because I'm this precious to you...

00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:34.840
No way you could have eyes for anyone else.

00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:39.880
So confident.

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:43.560
Shouldn't I be the one saying this?

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:46.320
Who compliments themselves like that?

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:47.960
And am I not precious?

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:56.120
Jay...

00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:57.440
Hold on...

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:02.600
This is the pub you were talking about?

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:07.800
It's Nop's pub, Phetai's friend.

00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:10.040
I heard Phe helped him start the place...

00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:11.400
before he went to America.

00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:13.040
Really?

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:19.800
Jieab...

00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:23.040
Can we go there tonight?

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:25.640
Maybe...

00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:28.200
Phetai might just show his face there.

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:30.280
Me, again?

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:54.440
I told you, we won't find him.

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:56.800
We've been surveying the place
for a few nights already.

00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:57.960
Haven't seen him at all.

00:17:57.960 --> 00:17:59.280
We've been standing here for an hour.

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:01.640
I haven't even seen a single leg hair of Phe.

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:03.680
Can't I go dance a little?

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:04.360
Or maybe…

00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:07.120
Have a little drink?

00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:10.520
Stop complaining.
We're here to help Pun tonight.

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:11.480
That’s what good friends do.

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:15.040
To be a spy, you've got to blend in,
don't you think?

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:17.160
I agree.

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:19.520
I don't like your face.

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:22.880
Oh, you little...

00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:25.960
Pun...

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:27.480
Are you okay?

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:28.800
We can go back first.

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:32.120
I'm okay.

00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:35.440
Probably just a little jet-lagged.

00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:37.080
Okay, I'm gonna...

00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:38.680
go wash my face first.

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:41.320
I'll be right back.

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:43.560
Can you go alone...

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.880
“Is that Phetai?”

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:36.120
“Smells so good...”

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:40.000
Are you okay?

00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:44.120
I'm fine. Excuse me.

00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:49.360
Huh...

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:52.080
Where are Best and Krit?

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:54.800
They went to get drinks.

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:02.600
In the end, Krit has worn down.

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:05.080
It's fun, you know.

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:06.800
Just satisfying Best's urge.

00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:08.040
And after this...

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:11.960
I'll help you find information on Nop's address.

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:14.120
If we can find the pub owner, Nop...

00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:16.080
I'm sure we can trace it back to Phe.

00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:18.040
Satisfying Best's urge...

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:20.280
or your own urge, Jieab?

00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:23.440
Everyone's.

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:26.560
We're not going to find Phe anyway.

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:29.320
Let's just have some fun.

00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:30.840
And celebrate your return.

00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:33.320
You know...

00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:35.680
that I've quit drinking.

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:41.080
Tonight, keep the nun inside...

00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:42.840
and let the little demon out.

00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:44.560
We'll take care of the demon for you.

00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:46.240
We won't let you get into trouble with anyone.

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:48.880
I'm not drinking.

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:51.000
Come on, just a little, Pun.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.880
Letting loose won't hurt.

00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:55.280
Look at Best.
She's even wilder, and that's okay.

00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:58.400
- Thanks for the compliment.
- You're welcome.

00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:00.400
No!

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:01.440
Pun...

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:02.480
Come on, just a little.

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:04.480
You just came from the City of Lights.

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:05.960
Aren’t you back with anything?

00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:08.200
Come on, don't worry.

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:12.600
Tonight, we'll take care of you.

00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:15.640
I'm not drinking!

00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:22.920
No!

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:25.120
No!

00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:27.920
No...

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:29.840
Well, it'll probably be fine!

00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:51.240
Oh no!

00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:53.400
Pun, you're screwed!

00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:36.160
Nice pick.

00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:39.320
This is my all-time favorite.

00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:02.600
No...

00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:04.040
I'm not stealing them.

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:08.080
Wait...

00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:09.200
Who are you?

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:10.960
And what am I doing here?

00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:12.040
Kidnapping?

00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:12.960
Ransom?

00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:13.400
Or...

00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:14.680
Do I look like a thief?

00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:21.440
Well...

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:23.080
Not really.

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:28.040
It would be a long story.

00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:30.200
Let's just say you were very drunk last night.

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:32.280
So I brought you here.

00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:34.280
I've washed your clothes.

00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:35.880
But I think...

00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:38.200
the outfit might not be appropriate for...

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:41.520
taking a taxi or the skytrain home.

00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:44.520
If you don't mind...

00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:47.640
you can wear my clothes.

00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:58.120
The bathroom is that way.

00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:00.760
Make yourself at home.

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:03.440
Wait,

00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:05.880
I think…

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:10.680
You shouldn't walk around
in a blanket like that.

00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:17.360
You should know that I'm...

00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:18.640
Naked.

00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:23.400
I'm afraid you might trip.

00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:27.360
I'm okay.

00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:28.960
And I promise...

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:30.800
that I will put your blanket...

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:33.800
back on the bed, neat and tidy.

00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:35.360
If you would be so kind as to...

00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:37.040
Leave me alone.

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:39.200
Okay.

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:08.960
I wasn't expecting a guest.

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:10.960
So I didn't tidy up.

00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:15.000
I was just wondering...

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.480
Last night...

00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:20.040
The two of us probably didn't…

00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:21.320
Don't worry.

00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:22.880
The marks on your body...

00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:24.600
are not from these things.

00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:31.120
I'll be outside...

00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:34.120
and leave you to your private time
in the bathroom.

00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:37.400
In case you remember anything.

00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:41.960
Okay.

00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:57.280
“What the hell happened last night?”

00:26:57.560 --> 00:27:01.000
“And that woman...”

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.160
Ugh! I can't remember.

00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:15.880
What?

00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:22.520
“For someone who is hungover.”

00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:06.880
Prang...

00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:11.280
No wonder she looked familiar.

00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:18.640
Ploy Pitcha...

00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:20.200
("Heartpop Television")

00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:22.160
You two can talk first.

00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:23.280
I'll be right back.

00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:24.360
Okay.

00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:27.880
Hey!

00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:33.440
Flirt with my Charles again...

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:36.080
and I'll slap you with a Dior!

00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:40.360
Flirt with my Charles again...

00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:43.160
and I'll slap you with a Dior!

00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:44.680
Flirt with my Charles again...

00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:46.400
and I'll slap you with a Dior!

00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:47.280
Remember that!

00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:48.360
Focus!

00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:00.800
Flirt with my Charles again...

00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:05.080
and I'll slap you with a Dior!

00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:09.320
I know of it even without watching the series.

00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:15.120
She was in a series with Prang...

00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:17.880
They must be close.

00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:43.120
“I couldn't find you...”

00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:45.080
“so I had to leave without saying goodbye.”

00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:48.080
“Please contact me at this number...”

00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:51.880
“so I can return you your clothes”

00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:53.400
“P.S.”

00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:54.920
“Thank you for not letting me...”

00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:57.160
“fall asleep with makeup on my face.”

00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:01.080
“From whoever is currently hungover.”

00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:21.960
Hello.

00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:23.720
Waanjieab...

00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:25.440
Pun!

00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:27.240
Are you safe?

00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:29.000
Where are you now?

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.800
I've been worried sick.

00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:32.640
You!

00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:34.600
You said you would take good care of me.

00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:36.600
Why did you lose me, then?

00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:39.560
You're a person, not a primary school eraser.

00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:40.880
You can't just get lost.

00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:42.720
You disappeared on your own.

00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:44.960
We were looking all over for you.

00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:46.600
We didn't even get any sleep.

00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:48.760
Yeah, let's talk about that later.

00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:51.040
Come and get me right now.

00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:53.440
And where are you?

00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:56.360
I'm at a condo…

00:30:58.440 --> 00:30:59.920
(“The Deviana”)

00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:02.680
Prang's condo!

00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:04.800
I'm at Prang's condo.

00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:06.360
Prang's condo?

00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:08.360
So you're at Prang's condo?

00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:09.480
But I called Prang last night…

00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:11.200
She said you weren't there.

00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:14.400
You called Prang too?

00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:17.360
I was worried!
What was I supposed to do?

00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:20.320
You're lucky I didn't call your parents.

00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:23.200
Let's talk about that later.

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:25.720
But right now,
you need to come and get me, quick.

00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:26.640
Bring my clothes, my things…

00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:29.080
all of my personal stuff.

00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:31.680
Because I'm borrowing someone else's phone right now.

00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:32.520
I feel bad.

00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:34.240
We can talk about everything else here.

00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:36.040
And importantly...

00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:37.040
bring food...

00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:37.840
Lots of it.

00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:39.000
I'm hungry.

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:42.640
That’s all.

00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:45.960
Pun...

00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:49.320
Hey...

00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:51.400
My phone...

00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:53.440
Can I have it back?

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.000
Sorry.

00:31:56.920 --> 00:31:58.280
“Why, pressed so hard.”

00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:15.680
Seems like you're so starving, Pun.

00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:17.360
Are you going to tell me...

00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:19.360
Why you warped here?

00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:21.560
You first.

00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:23.000
Tell me…

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.480
what happened last night after I got drunk.

00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:29.520
Your inner goddess came out.

00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:32.640
Once you're drunk, nothing can stop you.

00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:35.640
Here, I'll tell you what happened.

00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:45.080
Cheers?

00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:46.240
“Wait a minute…”

00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:47.240
“Who is this dude?”

00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:49.440
“Just some guy who tried to hit on you.”

00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:50.560
“Let me continue...”

00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:56.480
You got a problem with my friend?

00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:01.560
None of your business.

00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:03.600
What!

00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:05.320
So what are you gonna do?

00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:08.560
"That was actually a middle finger, not a thumb."

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.840
“Ugh, so dramatic. Why even bother censoring it!”

00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:15.880
Please don't do anything to my wife.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.520
Huh! How did you get here?
Go away!

00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:23.080
Who the hell are you!?
Go away!

00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:24.880
Why are you back?

00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:25.680
Go!

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:27.960
You still back?

00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:28.960
Go away!

00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:32.360
Are you messing with me?
Don't mess with me!

00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:41.680
Pun!

00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:44.840
Oh!

00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:46.040
That’s it.

00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:47.280
The star of the faculty when she's drunk...

00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:49.040
is just a dog.

00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:51.360
Awooo...

00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:54.160
If you're going to puke, do it properly.

00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:56.320
Woof! Woof!

00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:02.000
Hello?

00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:03.240
What!

00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:05.840
And how's Best?

00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:08.199
Yeah? Okay.

00:34:08.199 --> 00:34:09.320
I'll be right there.

00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:10.679
You...

00:34:10.679 --> 00:34:12.800
I'm going in to help them.

00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:15.480
You stay here, don't go anywhere.

00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:16.239
Mmm-hmm.

00:34:16.239 --> 00:34:17.880
I'll be right back.

00:34:18.159 --> 00:34:19.920
Okay, hello?

00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:23.639
And when I came back to for you...

00:34:23.639 --> 00:34:25.520
You were gone.

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:27.880
And...

00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:29.880
How are Best and Krit?

00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:33.440
Those two are passed out at my place.

00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:38.159
So, are you going to tell me...

00:34:38.159 --> 00:34:40.159
Why you're here?

00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:43.639
Do you know…

00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:46.280
Ploy Pitcha?

00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:52.199
Flirt with my Charles again...

00:34:52.199 --> 00:34:55.199
and I'll slap you with a Dior!

00:34:55.199 --> 00:34:56.320
Yeah.

00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:57.800
She really is famous, obviously.

00:34:58.280 --> 00:34:59.440
Why?

00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:01.040
Did you meet a celebrity?

00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:02.840
She's gorgeous?

00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:05.840
She is.

00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:08.640
Beautiful smiles.

00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:12.360
Infinite aura!

00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:14.920
Smells good.

00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:21.200
Geez, Pun.

00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:24.200
Did you really meet her?

00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:26.760
Or you were drunk and start kissing her neck?

00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:28.360
To be able to smell her like that.

00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:31.600
Hey, well...

00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:34.200
She's the one who brought me here.

00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:36.480
And...

00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:38.760
Did she do anything to you?

00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:40.640
I just heard a rumor...

00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:42.920
that she's secretly hooking up with girls.

00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:46.320
Well...

00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:48.240
It seems like she helped me.

00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:50.160
But...

00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:52.160
Did we hook up? I'm...

00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:53.520
not sure.

00:35:56.600 --> 00:35:58.560
But here's the highlight.

00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:02.040
Before I left her room...

00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:14.080
I found a picture of Phetai’s mom!

00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:16.160
Are you sure?

00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:17.840
Don't old people look the same?

00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:19.880
They don't.

00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:22.720
I've been staring at her picture for over two years.

00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:24.480
Like, she's my own relative.

00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:26.760
So, you're saying...

00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:28.760
This Ploy...

00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:30.400
knows Phetai?

00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:31.560
It's possible.

00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:34.680
And if we investigate Ploy Pitcha...

00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:38.040
We might find out where Phetai is.

00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:40.080
Pun...

00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:43.080
Why are you complicating things?

00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:45.240
Your dad is a high-ranking police officer.

00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:47.440
Why don't you just ask him for help?

00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:51.800
I don't want him to worry.

00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:54.800
But this could be a fraud case, Pun.

00:36:56.560 --> 00:36:58.040
I'll investigate it myself.

00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:00.440
If you don't want to help,
that’s okay.

00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:02.360
Fine.

00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:04.960
I'll help.

00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:14.680
And what makes you so sure...

00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:15.920
about this Ploy person?

00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:20.960
Instinct.

00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:26.240
How many times has your instinct
gotten you into trouble?

00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:29.680
But this time I'm sure, Jieab.

00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:34.280
That this Ploy Pitcha...

00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:37.640
must have what I'm looking for.

00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:50.960
What's that over there?

00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:55.480
Where?

00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:03.840
“I was panicking last night,
Prang was the first person I called. ”

00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:06.000
“I accidentally told her
you were back in Thailand.”

00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:09.040
“You should talk to Prang...”

00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:11.040
“she must be very worried by now.”

00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:17.200
Let's do it!

00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:32.960
Prang...

00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:49.000
“I don't know how to start explaining...”
“what I did to Prang and Jay.”

00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:53.320
“All I can say is
Prang was very angry with me then.”

00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:57.080
“That’s made me run away
to New York for two years.

00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:01.760
“Even though Prang called
and explained everything to me…”
“that it was all a misunderstanding.”

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:04.520
“It's still…”

00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:06.440
“hard for me.”

00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:09.680
“I've imagined this day many times.”

00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:13.280
“Imagined what today would be like.”

00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:17.680
“That I would open up with Prang.
That we would cry our eyes out.”

00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:20.800
“Or a scene where Prang scolds me.”

00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:24.840
“Turns out, I'm the only one
who hasn't moved on.”

00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:26.640
“And what more is…”

00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:29.280
“I feel even worse about the money.”

00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:31.200
A lot has happened...

00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:34.400
in the two years you were gone, Pun.

00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:39.840
I'm really happy for you two.

00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:47.440
About what happened back then…

00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:50.960
I'm sorry.

00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:52.920
Pun.

00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:56.520
We aren't holding onto it anymore.

00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:57.840
Right?

00:39:58.440 --> 00:39:59.880
And another thing…

00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:03.720
I told you, it wasn't your fault.

00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:07.120
You, please stop overthinking.

00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:15.240
I'm glad you're back.

00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:21.280
[Doorbell rings]

00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:29.680
Oh, Ploy...

00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:30.840
you're here.

00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:41.360
“But I'm sure, Jieab.”

00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:44.560
“That this Ploy Pitcha...”

00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:47.960
“must have what I'm looking for.”

00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:00.320
"Is that Phetai?"

00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:16.960
Are you okay?

00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:27.360
("Next episode".)

00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:29.760
So...
What happened last night?

00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:31.480
Why did I end up in your room?

00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:33.240
Call me "P'Ploy" first,

00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:35.960
and then I'll tell you.

00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:38.840
"Seriously, who wrote her into my scene today?"

00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:47.880
A dessert to say thank you.

00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:54.400
How can a person be so needlessly cute all the time?

00:41:57.440 --> 00:41:59.240
Does Ploy have any siblings?

00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:01.480
Or...

00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:02.640
Does she have a girlfriend yet?

00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:05.120
What's with all the questions?
Is there something going on?

00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:07.160
I have a plan.

00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:10.840
I'll just use my charm for a bit,

00:42:10.840 --> 00:42:13.840
get the information, and then pull back.

00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:20.600
Have you really thought this through?

00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:23.800
Ploy is like a flower that lures in insects.

00:42:24.200 --> 00:42:26.960
Just a sweet glance from her, and people swarm.

00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:30.640
What will you do if she actually starts to like you?

00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:33.680
That day... I think I might have lost an earring in your room.

00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:37.000
For your first time, Pun...

00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:39.520
You should find someone less wicked than Ploy.

00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:43.800
However much she feels for you...

00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:48.920
I curse you to feel a hundred times more for her.
