00:00:14.208 --> 00:00:16.000
Is everything there?

00:00:16.708 --> 00:00:19.208
Don't worry. There's plenty.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.791
The vegetables aren't very fresh.

00:00:24.791 --> 00:00:26.458
It's too hot.

00:00:27.916 --> 00:00:31.791
- Still complaining?
- Help me! Help me, please!

00:00:31.875 --> 00:00:33.166
Help me!

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:34.583
Please help me!

00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:37.125
Hey, stop that kid!
What the hell? Damn it!

00:00:37.208 --> 00:00:39.833
Come here. Hey! Pong, get out the way!

00:00:39.916 --> 00:00:41.416
Move. Out the way!

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.041
Come here.

00:00:43.125 --> 00:00:44.875
- Come here.
- Hey, hey, easy, man.

00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:46.291
Come here quickly.

00:00:46.375 --> 00:00:47.583
Get out here. Go!

00:00:47.666 --> 00:00:50.250
- Hey, take it easy! Take it easy.
- No!

00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:52.041
- What are you looking at?
- Go!

00:00:52.708 --> 00:00:53.916
Take her away!

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.791
What are you waiting for?

00:00:59.875 --> 00:01:00.958
Get back to work.

00:01:02.375 --> 00:01:03.583
Stay out of it.

00:01:11.583 --> 00:01:13.666
Hurry up! Come on, hurry!

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.083
- Quick!
- Go!

00:01:15.166 --> 00:01:16.000
Move faster!

00:01:16.583 --> 00:01:17.791
Hurry up!

00:01:18.791 --> 00:01:19.791
Hurry!

00:01:19.875 --> 00:01:21.750
- Go, go quickly!
- Keep walking.

00:01:21.833 --> 00:01:23.291
- Keep moving.
- Go!

00:01:24.166 --> 00:01:26.666
- Hurry up, hurry. Behind, faster!
- Go faster!

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:27.833
Hurry!

00:01:27.916 --> 00:01:29.416
- Walk faster!
- Hurry, go!

00:01:31.833 --> 00:01:32.666
What was that?

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.041
- Keep walking.
- Go! Keep moving.

00:01:49.666 --> 00:01:51.083
Hurry!

00:01:51.166 --> 00:01:52.208
- Hurry!
- Hurry!

00:01:52.291 --> 00:01:54.250
- Keep walking.
- Those behind, faster!

00:02:00.541 --> 00:02:01.375
- Hurry!
- Go!

00:02:01.458 --> 00:02:02.708
Walk faster!

00:02:02.791 --> 00:02:03.625
Go!

00:02:04.916 --> 00:02:06.875
Tell him to take her and bury the body.

00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:08.041
Get rid of her.

00:02:09.125 --> 00:02:09.958
Hey.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.583
Take her away.

00:02:25.541 --> 00:02:26.375
Go!

00:02:27.333 --> 00:02:28.750
Clean this up.

00:03:16.583 --> 00:03:18.083
No, don't run! Don't run!

00:03:18.666 --> 00:03:20.166
No, no. No, no…

00:03:22.666 --> 00:03:25.541
There are many guards outside.
Many guards over there.

00:03:25.625 --> 00:03:28.541
Come here. Come here.

00:03:28.625 --> 00:03:31.500
It's okay. I won't hurt you.

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:33.250
Calm down.

00:03:33.875 --> 00:03:34.833
Listen to me.

00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.250
You see that wall?

00:03:37.333 --> 00:03:40.416
There is electricity up there.

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.166
You cannot cross it.

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.208
There's still a higher wall outside

00:03:47.291 --> 00:03:48.666
and many guards outside.

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.208
So you will be taken back.

00:03:51.291 --> 00:03:52.416
If you run,

00:03:52.875 --> 00:03:53.833
you die.

00:03:53.916 --> 00:03:55.958
But if I stay, I die.

00:04:10.666 --> 00:04:11.500
Okay.

00:04:12.791 --> 00:04:13.625
Come with me.

00:04:14.791 --> 00:04:17.291
I will get you out of here.

00:04:19.458 --> 00:04:21.291
I come here to work every day.

00:04:22.333 --> 00:04:23.375
They don't check me.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.833
Okay?

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:27.708
You just…

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.500
You just hide inside my car

00:04:30.583 --> 00:04:32.083
and keep quiet.

00:04:33.625 --> 00:04:35.416
You are definitely okay.

00:04:36.875 --> 00:04:37.875
Okay?

00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:38.958
Let's go.

00:04:39.416 --> 00:04:40.250
Wait.

00:04:41.791 --> 00:04:43.250
Can I bring my friends?

00:04:43.333 --> 00:04:44.166
Just two.

00:04:44.666 --> 00:04:46.083
- No.
- Please.

00:04:46.166 --> 00:04:48.291
Tomorrow, same time.

00:04:50.625 --> 00:04:51.583
Please.

00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:53.875
Hey.

00:05:54.416 --> 00:05:55.250
Hey.

00:06:04.875 --> 00:06:05.958
Okay.

00:06:13.291 --> 00:06:14.541
Be careful.

00:06:24.666 --> 00:06:25.833
You lie low.

00:06:25.916 --> 00:06:26.750
Keep quiet.

00:06:26.833 --> 00:06:28.250
I will tell you

00:06:28.333 --> 00:06:31.000
when it's safe
by knocking on the car four times.

00:06:32.333 --> 00:06:34.500
Then you can come out, okay?

00:07:10.708 --> 00:07:11.625
Done for the day?

00:07:11.708 --> 00:07:12.541
Yes.

00:07:19.125 --> 00:07:21.166
You guys sure have a tough job.

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:26.125
Have a cigarette.

00:07:26.208 --> 00:07:27.041
Sure.

00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:32.708
Okay, you can go.

00:08:23.541 --> 00:08:24.458
Are we there?

00:08:25.291 --> 00:08:26.125
Shh.

00:08:54.375 --> 00:08:55.750
What do you want?

00:08:57.250 --> 00:08:58.750
The girls are so happy.

00:08:59.875 --> 00:09:01.500
Give them some hope.

00:09:42.916 --> 00:09:44.791
06 Chaos Day

00:09:44.875 --> 00:09:46.833
I never believed they'd actually manage

00:09:46.916 --> 00:09:48.916
to get Chang Shih-kai out.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.583
I didn't either. He was on death row.

00:09:52.666 --> 00:09:53.875
Exactly.

00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:55.375
How'd they pull it off?

00:09:55.458 --> 00:09:56.458
Who knows?

00:09:56.916 --> 00:09:58.333
What're you talking about?

00:09:59.416 --> 00:10:00.875
We're just wondering

00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:03.333
how you managed
to get Chang Shih-kai out alive.

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:05.666
Well…

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:07.708
How do I put it?

00:10:08.125 --> 00:10:09.375
It was so complicated,

00:10:09.458 --> 00:10:10.625
you know?

00:10:11.083 --> 00:10:12.000
So, we…

00:10:12.666 --> 00:10:14.208
Paid lots of money.

00:10:14.666 --> 00:10:16.666
Right. We bribed the guards,

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:19.416
switched the injections

00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:21.500
and faked his death.

00:10:22.625 --> 00:10:24.541
Then we bribed the crematorium staff

00:10:24.625 --> 00:10:25.708
and got him out.

00:10:31.375 --> 00:10:32.583
They used money…

00:10:32.666 --> 00:10:33.500
Paid money.

00:10:34.083 --> 00:10:35.041
…bribed the guards,

00:10:35.125 --> 00:10:36.458
and faked his death.

00:10:36.541 --> 00:10:37.750
They stole a person…

00:10:37.833 --> 00:10:38.875
From the crematorium.

00:10:39.875 --> 00:10:41.916
That's what happened?

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:42.875
Yes.

00:10:43.375 --> 00:10:44.333
- Exactly.
- Exactly.

00:10:44.416 --> 00:10:45.666
We spent loads of money.

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:46.583
Right.

00:10:49.125 --> 00:10:50.041
Okay.

00:10:50.125 --> 00:10:51.875
It's not bad. Pretty spicy.

00:10:55.666 --> 00:10:56.958
This broth's good.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.083
We've got work to do.

00:11:00.833 --> 00:11:02.750
Hurry up and eat.

00:11:18.083 --> 00:11:19.250
The paperwork's done.

00:11:25.291 --> 00:11:26.833
Can I have my passport back?

00:11:27.375 --> 00:11:28.333
What's the rush?

00:11:28.791 --> 00:11:31.166
I'll contact you after I've checked them.

00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:32.125
Checked what?

00:11:32.208 --> 00:11:33.041
SUN KUO-CHIANG

00:11:33.125 --> 00:11:34.250
How long must I wait?

00:11:34.333 --> 00:11:36.291
Until I'm happy.

00:11:40.625 --> 00:11:41.458
Fine.

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:44.541
Aren't you going to say hi to Jin Jin?

00:11:45.625 --> 00:11:48.500
I have lots going on.
The caregiver can't come at night.

00:11:48.583 --> 00:11:51.166
I want you
to look after Jin Jin in the evenings.

00:11:53.583 --> 00:11:55.166
She is your daughter.

00:11:55.875 --> 00:11:59.458
I trust you won't
let anything happen to her.

00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:27.083
You're awake?

00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:30.166
Want some breakfast?

00:12:34.583 --> 00:12:35.833
What are you doing?

00:12:35.916 --> 00:12:38.416
Trading cryptocurrency.

00:12:46.541 --> 00:12:47.375
You're angry?

00:12:48.375 --> 00:12:49.208
Well?

00:12:58.166 --> 00:12:59.000
Here.

00:13:01.041 --> 00:13:02.416
I bought you a present.

00:13:03.541 --> 00:13:04.833
What for?

00:13:07.708 --> 00:13:11.041
It's your favorite color.

00:13:14.666 --> 00:13:16.041
- A dress?
- Yeah.

00:13:17.208 --> 00:13:19.125
Mom wants to have dinner with us.

00:13:19.208 --> 00:13:20.333
I know.

00:13:20.416 --> 00:13:22.416
- When?
- Tonight.

00:13:25.375 --> 00:13:26.875
- Tonight?
- Yes.

00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:29.250
What's wrong?

00:13:37.666 --> 00:13:38.666
No need to worry.

00:13:39.666 --> 00:13:41.625
She just wants to get to know you.

00:13:43.583 --> 00:13:46.125
And I want to let her know

00:13:47.625 --> 00:13:50.500
that we're thinking of getting married.

00:13:53.291 --> 00:13:54.375
Married?

00:14:00.916 --> 00:14:03.000
You'd better answer.

00:14:09.458 --> 00:14:10.291
Who is it?

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.000
My mom.

00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:18.041
Hey, Mom.

00:14:18.125 --> 00:14:19.416
Come and get your money.

00:14:20.125 --> 00:14:22.583
Just transfer it to my account.

00:14:22.666 --> 00:14:25.708
I can only give you cash.
But I'm warning you

00:14:26.416 --> 00:14:27.750
keep your mouth shut.

00:14:27.833 --> 00:14:30.041
Okay. Thank you, Mom.

00:14:33.083 --> 00:14:36.125
Those who emulate the sages
are kind and talented.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.541
As we live our lives,

00:14:38.625 --> 00:14:40.166
we must practice cultivation.

00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:42.458
Not to pursue perfection,

00:14:42.541 --> 00:14:44.875
but to accept our own imperfections

00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:48.375
and face the world with impartiality.

00:14:50.083 --> 00:14:51.458
Follow the path, worship,

00:14:51.541 --> 00:14:54.000
and study with devotion.

00:14:54.833 --> 00:14:55.708
We…

00:14:55.791 --> 00:14:56.833
- What's wrong?
- We…

00:14:59.083 --> 00:15:00.958
The gods appeared to me in a dream.

00:15:01.916 --> 00:15:03.500
I was told

00:15:04.083 --> 00:15:06.375
if I let go of the resentment in my heart,

00:15:06.458 --> 00:15:08.708
my daughter would wake up.

00:15:09.333 --> 00:15:12.125
But my daughter still hasn't woken up.

00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:21.458
Can you perform
another ritual for my daughter?

00:15:22.166 --> 00:15:23.916
If my daughter could just wake up,

00:15:25.416 --> 00:15:26.791
I'd commit to doing good

00:15:26.875 --> 00:15:28.583
and donate lots and lots of money.

00:15:36.166 --> 00:15:38.875
Master, you are powerful.
Please help her.

00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:40.041
Yes, please help her.

00:15:40.125 --> 00:15:41.583
Please help me.

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:48.333
Okay.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.583
I'll perform a ritual for you.

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:53.333
Thank you.

00:15:53.791 --> 00:15:54.833
Thank you, Master.

00:15:54.916 --> 00:15:56.500
A ritual won't work.

00:15:57.458 --> 00:16:00.875
You still haven't let go
of the resentment in your heart.

00:16:09.333 --> 00:16:10.333
Yueh-hua, Yueh-chia,

00:16:10.916 --> 00:16:12.416
we're short on staff.

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:14.000
Go help out in the cafeteria.

00:16:14.583 --> 00:16:16.958
- Let's go to the cafeteria.
- We'll all go.

00:16:17.041 --> 00:16:19.375
- I'm sure he'll help you.
- Things will improve.

00:16:19.458 --> 00:16:20.916
Thank you, thank you.

00:16:40.458 --> 00:16:41.291
Drop the act.

00:16:42.458 --> 00:16:43.375
Tell me.

00:16:44.208 --> 00:16:45.958
What exactly do you want?

00:16:51.250 --> 00:16:53.541
To pray for the gods' blessings.

00:16:57.791 --> 00:16:58.625
Don't be dumb.

00:16:59.208 --> 00:17:01.166
I don't believe this religious baloney.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.125
No matter how much I pray,

00:17:04.208 --> 00:17:05.916
my son's never coming back.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.833
And your daughter won't wake up.

00:17:08.416 --> 00:17:10.333
I don't know if she will ever wake up,

00:17:11.333 --> 00:17:13.875
but your son really has come back to life.

00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:16.375
Mom, this is Chang Shih-kai.

00:17:17.166 --> 00:17:19.833
It's April 10th, 2024.

00:17:20.625 --> 00:17:22.333
This is today's newspaper.

00:17:22.416 --> 00:17:24.041
It's proof I'm still alive.

00:17:24.541 --> 00:17:27.250
I'll explain
what happened after I get out.

00:17:27.333 --> 00:17:29.250
Prepare 40 million right away.

00:17:29.333 --> 00:17:30.791
How is he alive?

00:17:30.875 --> 00:17:32.041
Are you happy?

00:17:33.833 --> 00:17:35.875
There's a blue van outside.

00:17:35.958 --> 00:17:39.000
Put 40 million in cash

00:17:39.083 --> 00:17:40.833
in the trunk.

00:17:40.916 --> 00:17:42.541
Go to the address in the GPS

00:17:42.625 --> 00:17:44.208
at 8 p.m. tonight

00:17:44.791 --> 00:17:46.333
and you'll be able to see him.

00:17:47.291 --> 00:17:50.083
Remember. No guns or bodyguards.

00:17:50.916 --> 00:17:54.208
If my partner
isn't back by the specified time,

00:17:54.833 --> 00:17:58.083
I'll reveal to the world
everything Chang Shih-kai has told us.

00:18:01.541 --> 00:18:02.750
May the gods bless you.

00:18:21.375 --> 00:18:22.208
Welcome.

00:18:34.333 --> 00:18:35.250
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:18:39.083 --> 00:18:40.208
Everyone, get out.

00:18:40.291 --> 00:18:41.291
Turn off the music.

00:18:46.333 --> 00:18:47.208
You can stay.

00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:49.708
Sit there.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.291
Who said you could leave?

00:18:56.041 --> 00:18:57.791
I told you to stay in Taiwan.

00:18:57.875 --> 00:19:00.083
If it goes to court,
we'll get a top lawyer.

00:19:00.166 --> 00:19:02.375
You'll be out in a few days.
Why run?

00:19:02.458 --> 00:19:03.625
I'm not running.

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:06.125
I'm taking care of something.

00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:08.291
Don't worry.

00:19:08.375 --> 00:19:10.208
Yang's arranged everything.

00:19:15.583 --> 00:19:16.750
Kai.

00:19:16.833 --> 00:19:19.625
It's almost time.
You'd better go and pack.

00:19:19.708 --> 00:19:21.958
Don't worry.
I'll call when I get there.

00:19:34.291 --> 00:19:36.041
So you knew he was leaving?

00:19:39.583 --> 00:19:41.250
I only just found out.

00:19:56.833 --> 00:20:00.750
I woke up in the middle of the night
and An Chi was missing.

00:20:00.833 --> 00:20:02.166
I was worried about her,

00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:06.916
so I tracked her phone's location
and called the police.

00:20:11.166 --> 00:20:13.458
Sorry, don't hold it against me.

00:20:13.541 --> 00:20:15.625
It was just a misunderstanding.

00:20:15.708 --> 00:20:17.291
You didn't ask me here

00:20:18.375 --> 00:20:19.833
just to say that, did you?

00:20:24.250 --> 00:20:26.000
I have a favor to ask.

00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:28.583
If the evidence holds up

00:20:28.666 --> 00:20:29.958
and the court accepts it,

00:20:30.041 --> 00:20:32.000
can you return Chang Shih-kai…

00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:36.750
…return Chang Shih-kai
to his original state?

00:20:37.791 --> 00:20:38.916
What state?

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.375
Legally speaking,

00:20:40.458 --> 00:20:42.750
Chang Shih-kai is dead.

00:20:43.583 --> 00:20:45.208
As long as he's alive,

00:20:45.291 --> 00:20:48.208
he's a threat to you and Hui-chun, no?

00:20:48.291 --> 00:20:50.500
I'm only asking this for your sake.

00:20:51.916 --> 00:20:54.125
You're such a hypocrite.

00:20:54.208 --> 00:20:56.250
If that's all, I'm leaving.

00:20:57.541 --> 00:20:59.125
Okay, I admit it.

00:20:59.208 --> 00:21:00.958
I want Chang Shih-kai dead.

00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:08.958
I don't want An Chi and her baby…

00:21:11.375 --> 00:21:13.375
…living in his shadow.

00:21:22.125 --> 00:21:24.833
Are you sure An Chi was raped?

00:21:29.458 --> 00:21:31.208
What do you mean by that?

00:21:32.458 --> 00:21:34.708
I think there was more
going on between them.

00:21:37.791 --> 00:21:39.583
Did Chang Shih-kai tell you that?

00:21:43.041 --> 00:21:44.833
One thing keeps bothering me.

00:21:45.375 --> 00:21:47.416
Jin Jin got Hsin-yi to come here.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.166
Jin Jin told Hui-chun

00:21:49.250 --> 00:21:50.791
that An Chi asked her to come.

00:21:50.875 --> 00:21:52.250
So who asked An Chi

00:21:52.875 --> 00:21:54.208
to come here?

00:21:54.791 --> 00:21:56.583
Think about this rationally.

00:21:56.666 --> 00:21:59.500
An Chi told me
that Jin Jin asked her to come.

00:21:59.583 --> 00:22:01.833
And if An Chi
was Chang Shih-kai's girlfriend,

00:22:01.916 --> 00:22:03.750
why would she alert the police?

00:22:03.833 --> 00:22:06.250
Besides, she'd never
fall for someone like him.

00:22:06.333 --> 00:22:08.291
- Have proof of that?
- Have you got any?

00:22:08.375 --> 00:22:11.000
How do you know
Hui-chun and Jin Jin weren't lying?

00:22:32.333 --> 00:22:34.083
I had a case once.

00:22:35.875 --> 00:22:38.458
Some high school students
were doing drugs together.

00:22:38.541 --> 00:22:40.666
One of them died of an overdose.

00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:42.250
His mother filed a lawsuit

00:22:42.333 --> 00:22:44.291
against all his friends that were there

00:22:44.375 --> 00:22:45.583
because she believed

00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:48.083
that her son was led astray

00:22:48.166 --> 00:22:49.375
and they killed him.

00:22:50.458 --> 00:22:52.375
Do you know what the outcome was?

00:22:55.916 --> 00:22:57.916
The guy who overdosed

00:22:59.166 --> 00:23:00.416
was a drug dealer.

00:23:01.083 --> 00:23:03.541
He had supplied all the drugs.

00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:06.166
What are you trying to say?

00:23:06.250 --> 00:23:07.333
That not everyone

00:23:07.833 --> 00:23:09.875
who appears to be the victim actually is.

00:23:10.458 --> 00:23:13.625
Just because
Jin Jin is lying in a hospital bed

00:23:13.708 --> 00:23:15.958
doesn't make this An Chi's fault.

00:23:21.791 --> 00:23:23.916
Even if it was Hsin-yi's fault,

00:23:24.708 --> 00:23:26.250
I still want the truth.

00:23:29.083 --> 00:23:32.250
You should concentrate
on proving they're laundering money.

00:23:33.083 --> 00:23:35.375
Once this is all over, I will…

00:23:37.083 --> 00:23:38.500
How did you put it?

00:23:39.666 --> 00:23:41.125
"Return Chang Shih-kai

00:23:41.208 --> 00:23:42.666
to his original state."

00:23:51.333 --> 00:23:54.458
SANCHING TAI CHI ASSOCIATION

00:24:16.166 --> 00:24:17.500
Is Kai really still alive?

00:24:18.416 --> 00:24:20.041
Couldn't the video be fake?

00:24:20.125 --> 00:24:21.958
That's why I need to see for myself.

00:24:22.041 --> 00:24:24.125
If it's true, we're in big trouble.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:26.375
Don't give them any money.

00:24:26.458 --> 00:24:28.250
Just get someone to kill them.

00:24:28.333 --> 00:24:30.208
Bidding on that land will start soon.

00:24:30.791 --> 00:24:32.125
I don't want bloody hands

00:24:32.666 --> 00:24:34.208
at such a crucial time.

00:24:34.291 --> 00:24:35.833
That's all the money we have.

00:24:35.916 --> 00:24:38.208
We'll have plenty more
once the fund's set up.

00:24:38.291 --> 00:24:39.791
This is nothing in comparison.

00:24:41.708 --> 00:24:43.125
Is that all for me?

00:24:46.125 --> 00:24:46.958
Damn.

00:24:48.416 --> 00:24:50.875
I forgot to tell you
that it'll take a few days.

00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:52.708
A few days?

00:24:53.416 --> 00:24:55.041
You promised to have it today.

00:24:55.125 --> 00:24:56.958
- Well I don't.
- What's that then?

00:24:57.041 --> 00:24:57.916
She needs that.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.208
I'm not talking to you.

00:24:59.291 --> 00:25:00.166
Where's the rest?

00:25:00.250 --> 00:25:01.666
Where'd you hide Kai's money?

00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:03.291
That's enough. Get out!

00:25:03.375 --> 00:25:05.333
Why should I? That money's mine.

00:25:05.416 --> 00:25:06.833
You promised Kai.

00:25:06.916 --> 00:25:08.875
You can have it after the wake.

00:25:08.958 --> 00:25:10.875
- Just wait until then.
- I need it now!

00:25:10.958 --> 00:25:12.041
Chang I-ting!

00:25:17.708 --> 00:25:18.958
You've got one hour

00:25:19.666 --> 00:25:21.000
to get me that money

00:25:21.625 --> 00:25:23.458
or who knows what I'll do.

00:25:24.208 --> 00:25:25.916
I might just take us all down.

00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:40.291
What're you doing? Let go!

00:25:43.083 --> 00:25:44.458
Lock her up!

00:25:44.958 --> 00:25:45.833
Fuck you!

00:26:14.916 --> 00:26:16.041
Okay, okay.

00:26:22.666 --> 00:26:24.000
Okay.

00:26:29.916 --> 00:26:31.333
Guess who I saw in jail?

00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:39.583
Here.

00:26:47.208 --> 00:26:48.333
Hey, hurry up! Faster!

00:26:50.125 --> 00:26:51.375
What are you doing? Huh?

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.250
Get going! Eat up!

00:27:13.916 --> 00:27:15.875
- Let's go!
- It's not our business.

00:27:15.958 --> 00:27:17.708
- Go!
- Hurry up!

00:27:17.791 --> 00:27:20.208
Come on.
It's none of our business. Keep going!

00:27:40.916 --> 00:27:42.416
I met Chung in jail.

00:27:43.125 --> 00:27:44.291
He told me

00:27:44.875 --> 00:27:47.916
it was no accident that you were arrested.

00:27:48.541 --> 00:27:50.458
Someone wanted him to kill you.

00:28:07.375 --> 00:28:08.500
Be careful.

00:28:08.583 --> 00:28:09.958
Okay. You too.

00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:20.791
What is this? Open up!

00:28:21.541 --> 00:28:22.708
What is this?

00:28:59.208 --> 00:29:01.083
Hello? Eason? What's up?

00:29:01.541 --> 00:29:04.000
Nothing, I just wanted to tell you

00:29:04.083 --> 00:29:05.625
I've paid for the bangles.

00:29:05.708 --> 00:29:07.375
I'll bring them tonight

00:29:07.458 --> 00:29:08.875
as a gift from you.

00:29:09.416 --> 00:29:11.583
No, I wanted to pay for them.

00:29:11.666 --> 00:29:13.083
I get why you wanted to.

00:29:13.166 --> 00:29:15.916
And I know the money
doesn't matter to you.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:17.083
Of course it doesn't.

00:29:17.166 --> 00:29:18.833
But this is my first gift to her.

00:29:18.916 --> 00:29:20.458
I can't have you pay.

00:29:20.541 --> 00:29:23.375
It's fine.
It doesn't matter who pays for what.

00:29:24.291 --> 00:29:26.375
Just remember to be on time tonight.

00:29:26.458 --> 00:29:27.875
Mom's going to love you.

00:29:28.958 --> 00:29:30.041
Okay.

00:29:30.125 --> 00:29:31.208
I'll be there.

00:32:31.833 --> 00:32:32.666
Hurry.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.083
Get the lighter.

00:32:59.458 --> 00:33:00.958
Looks like Chung wasn't lying.

00:33:18.750 --> 00:33:20.583
The person who wanted you dead.

00:33:28.791 --> 00:33:30.166
Give me your phone.

00:33:30.791 --> 00:33:32.000
And all your money.

00:33:43.041 --> 00:33:45.041
I'll give it to you. Here's one million.

00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:47.083
Kill him for me.

00:33:55.791 --> 00:33:56.625
Okay.

00:34:04.916 --> 00:34:06.125
Get him into the car.

00:34:19.666 --> 00:34:20.625
I will help you.

00:34:21.791 --> 00:34:22.625
Go.

00:34:48.416 --> 00:34:49.291
Shit.

00:34:56.333 --> 00:34:58.041
- Here.
- Okay. Okay.

00:35:09.250 --> 00:35:10.375
This way, please.

00:35:10.458 --> 00:35:11.541
Sorry, I'm late.

00:35:13.958 --> 00:35:15.458
What is it? Where's your mom?

00:35:15.958 --> 00:35:17.250
She already left.

00:35:19.166 --> 00:35:20.125
Eason, I'm sorry.

00:35:20.208 --> 00:35:22.666
Something really important came up.
Wait for me.

00:35:37.833 --> 00:35:39.458
My mom just gave this to me.

00:35:48.333 --> 00:35:50.333
Is that you in the photo?

00:35:52.041 --> 00:35:53.833
Chang Shih-kai's your brother.

00:35:54.333 --> 00:35:56.833
{\an8}MURDERERS FORFEIT THEIR LIVES.
JUSTICE IS DONE.

00:35:57.333 --> 00:35:58.666
What have you got to say?

00:36:17.375 --> 00:36:18.208
Eason.

00:36:20.875 --> 00:36:21.791
Eason!

00:36:47.541 --> 00:36:48.375
Hello, Kevin?

00:36:49.333 --> 00:36:51.291
I've exchanged the Bitcoins.
You got the money?

00:36:53.666 --> 00:36:57.583
This may not follow the rules,
but I need to cancel the bangle deal.

00:36:57.666 --> 00:37:00.166
Just refund the money
to Ms. Chang's credit card.

00:37:00.250 --> 00:37:01.125
Thank you.

00:37:07.041 --> 00:37:08.250
I returned the bangles.

00:37:09.416 --> 00:37:10.833
You don't need to pay.

00:37:17.916 --> 00:37:20.750
Look, I'm not angry
about your family's background.

00:37:22.583 --> 00:37:24.208
I'm angry you kept it from me.

00:37:25.208 --> 00:37:29.166
You think my feelings for you
would change because of this?

00:37:36.333 --> 00:37:38.208
What your brother did

00:37:39.625 --> 00:37:41.125
had nothing to do with you.

00:37:42.333 --> 00:37:44.125
You have your own life.

00:37:46.958 --> 00:37:48.083
Come with me.

00:37:51.833 --> 00:37:53.833
We'll go somewhere no one knows us.

00:37:55.250 --> 00:37:56.416
Give me two years.

00:37:57.583 --> 00:37:59.958
Then I won't need my mom's permission

00:38:00.041 --> 00:38:01.916
to access the family trust fund.

00:38:03.625 --> 00:38:05.000
But until then,

00:38:06.166 --> 00:38:08.541
life with me isn't going to be easy.

00:38:17.458 --> 00:38:19.375
I can fix all that.

00:38:42.666 --> 00:38:43.625
You were right.

00:38:43.708 --> 00:38:44.541
Shh.

00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:46.416
Is she sleeping?

00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:47.375
Yes.

00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:50.041
Thanks for looking after her.

00:38:51.875 --> 00:38:53.083
Chang Shih-kai's mother

00:38:53.166 --> 00:38:54.500
does have a crypto wallet.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:58.208
Chang I-ting's gone
to the Tai Chi Association to get it.

00:38:59.791 --> 00:39:02.416
Once she gets the crypto wallet,

00:39:03.041 --> 00:39:04.916
make sure she leaves it with you.

00:39:05.291 --> 00:39:06.125
Okay.

00:39:07.250 --> 00:39:09.000
She really trusts you now, right?

00:39:09.625 --> 00:39:10.583
Absolutely.

00:39:12.083 --> 00:39:13.041
That's good.

00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:26.166
Once you get the wallet,

00:39:27.375 --> 00:39:29.166
this will all be over.

00:39:29.791 --> 00:39:31.666
Thanks for everything you've done.

00:39:44.208 --> 00:39:46.166
I've been meaning to ask you something.

00:39:47.083 --> 00:39:51.041
After I give you the wallet,

00:39:51.708 --> 00:39:53.375
will you have no more use for me?

00:40:01.416 --> 00:40:02.666
I'm kidding.

00:40:02.750 --> 00:40:04.375
I know you're stressed out.

00:40:04.458 --> 00:40:06.083
Just trying to lighten the mood.

00:40:06.166 --> 00:40:07.666
It's not like I like you.

00:40:07.750 --> 00:40:09.333
We have a working relationship,

00:40:09.416 --> 00:40:12.041
so I'm happy to be useful.

00:40:13.208 --> 00:40:15.708
- I…
- I was never trying to use you.

00:40:17.958 --> 00:40:19.125
You're amazing.

00:40:22.208 --> 00:40:23.750
Actually…

00:40:49.208 --> 00:40:50.041
Jin Jin,

00:40:51.166 --> 00:40:53.166
An Chi finally came to see you.

00:40:54.916 --> 00:40:57.125
Ms Wang,
can I talk to you about something?

00:41:02.333 --> 00:41:03.750
What is it?

00:41:08.125 --> 00:41:09.458
One million.

00:41:12.666 --> 00:41:13.750
Hui-chun.

00:41:13.833 --> 00:41:15.541
We're done. Heading back now.

00:41:34.583 --> 00:41:35.666
What happened?

00:41:40.791 --> 00:41:42.666
There is something you need to know.

00:41:45.083 --> 00:41:48.208
How'd Chang Shih-kai know
I was helping those girls escape?

00:41:49.208 --> 00:41:51.041
Because someone snitched.

00:41:51.125 --> 00:41:53.541
One of the girls is…

00:41:54.250 --> 00:41:57.333
Kai's girlfriend.

00:42:14.708 --> 00:42:16.291
Jin Jin asked me to come.

00:42:18.250 --> 00:42:20.083
Jin Jin said you asked her.

00:42:20.666 --> 00:42:22.333
She wasn't telling you the truth.

00:42:22.958 --> 00:42:24.666
Jin Jin had been to Benkha before.

00:42:25.416 --> 00:42:27.625
And she met Chang Shih-kai before I did.

00:42:27.708 --> 00:42:28.791
How can that be?

00:42:29.291 --> 00:42:30.125
It's true.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:33.333
I never mentioned it,

00:42:33.416 --> 00:42:35.208
because she was my friend.

00:42:35.791 --> 00:42:38.083
I didn't want people
thinking she was involved.

00:42:38.833 --> 00:42:40.291
And if Chao Ching knew,

00:42:40.375 --> 00:42:41.875
she'd never have forgiven her.

00:42:53.833 --> 00:42:56.333
How dare you
say that in front of Jin Jin.

00:42:58.458 --> 00:43:00.125
Did your mom get you to say this?

00:43:00.208 --> 00:43:01.250
Well?

00:43:01.750 --> 00:43:02.916
I'm not lying.

00:43:03.458 --> 00:43:05.541
Jin Jin already knew Chang Shih-kai.

00:43:05.625 --> 00:43:07.750
- And she started all this.
- That's enough.

00:43:11.250 --> 00:43:12.083
Leave.

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:16.208
Leave!

00:43:40.791 --> 00:43:42.041
Hello, I'm Jin Jin.

00:43:42.125 --> 00:43:45.250
It's June 1st, 2 p.m.

00:43:45.333 --> 00:43:46.583
I just got off the plane.

00:43:46.666 --> 00:43:48.666
This is my good friend, An Chi.

00:43:48.750 --> 00:43:49.916
Hello!

00:43:50.791 --> 00:43:53.000
Guys, honestly,
the weather here is so…

00:43:54.083 --> 00:43:56.958
I'm Jin Jin. It's June 1st…

00:43:59.333 --> 00:44:01.958
JUNE 1ST, 2 P.M.

00:44:31.333 --> 00:44:33.916
DEPARTED 22ND FEBRUARY, 2019

00:44:51.750 --> 00:44:53.208
I bought some noodles.

00:44:53.291 --> 00:44:54.125
Okay.

00:45:13.541 --> 00:45:14.583
Are you okay?

00:45:15.208 --> 00:45:16.125
I'm fine.

00:45:16.666 --> 00:45:17.708
Just a bit tired.

00:45:28.083 --> 00:45:30.208
An Chi came to the hospital today.

00:45:32.166 --> 00:45:33.875
She told me it was Jin Jin

00:45:33.958 --> 00:45:35.875
who tricked her into coming to Benkha.

00:45:38.041 --> 00:45:40.541
And that Jin Jin
and Chang Shih-kai had a thing.

00:45:41.375 --> 00:45:42.625
What a joke.

00:45:43.250 --> 00:45:45.208
She had Chang Shih-kai's baby

00:45:45.291 --> 00:45:46.583
and bad mouths Jin Jin.

00:45:46.666 --> 00:45:47.875
What's she up to?

00:45:49.375 --> 00:45:51.250
Jin Jin can't even defend herself.

00:45:52.708 --> 00:45:54.458
What if she could?

00:45:58.833 --> 00:46:00.041
What do you mean?

00:46:04.458 --> 00:46:06.375
If Jin Jin does die,

00:46:07.750 --> 00:46:10.791
we can resurrect her
like we did Chang Shih-kai.

00:46:12.125 --> 00:46:13.708
Do you know what you're saying?

00:46:13.791 --> 00:46:15.875
Then we'll find out the truth.

00:46:15.958 --> 00:46:18.208
So we kill my daughter
to find out the truth?

00:46:22.958 --> 00:46:24.333
What if she wakes up

00:46:24.916 --> 00:46:26.333
and it wasn't her?

00:46:30.375 --> 00:46:32.416
At least you'll have seven days

00:46:33.541 --> 00:46:35.208
to say goodbye to her properly.

00:46:40.708 --> 00:46:42.541
Hsin-yi never got the chance.

00:47:03.833 --> 00:47:04.916
Are you happy?

00:47:06.875 --> 00:47:08.416
Feel some hope?

00:47:22.916 --> 00:47:24.333
The wallet and gun are gone.

00:47:25.708 --> 00:47:27.583
The invites are out. We can't delay.

00:47:28.208 --> 00:47:29.291
Who cares about that?

00:47:29.375 --> 00:47:31.458
She's stolen my life savings!

00:47:31.541 --> 00:47:33.000
Find her.

00:47:33.083 --> 00:47:36.041
If we don't get it back before the event,
we're dead meat.
