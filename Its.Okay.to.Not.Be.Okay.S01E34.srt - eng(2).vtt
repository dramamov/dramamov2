WEBVTT

00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:02.460
Didn't he used to abuse her?

00:00:02.544 --> 00:00:04.295
He's the reason Bella's traumatized.

00:00:04.379 --> 00:00:06.840
Whatever you say,
I'm not coming back to you!

00:00:06.923 --> 00:00:08.633
Don't you understand that, huh?!

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:13.346
They say that only
insecure men hurt women.

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:15.056
I told you to stay out of this.

00:00:16.182 --> 00:00:17.767
- Mia!
- I told you!

00:00:23.106 --> 00:00:28.945
Even when you know
that you shouldn't follow your heart,

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:33.533
what can you do, when your head and heart

00:00:33.616 --> 00:00:35.118
keep shouting her name?

00:00:35.577 --> 00:00:36.578
Patrick!

00:00:37.954 --> 00:00:39.205
Patpat!

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:41.041
Stop punching him.

00:00:41.124 --> 00:00:43.626
It's wrong to hurt people.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.211
Don't hurt him.

00:00:46.212 --> 00:00:48.882
It can't be, was she in love?

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:36.781
Are you hurt?

00:02:59.596 --> 00:03:03.975
{\an8}Patrick, haven't
you read the rules in the handbook?

00:03:04.058 --> 00:03:08.688
{\an8}Staff must never cause
harm to any patient or visitor.

00:03:09.063 --> 00:03:11.065
{\an8}Jerome wants to press charges against you.

00:03:12.442 --> 00:03:13.776
{\an8}Patpat.

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.529
{\an8}You should say sorry.

00:03:17.238 --> 00:03:20.074
{\an8}You did something bad.

00:03:25.496 --> 00:03:28.166
{\an8}I will accept whatever punishment
you deem appropriate.

00:03:29.167 --> 00:03:30.710
{\an8}

00:03:30.793 --> 00:03:33.963
{\an8}Are you not going to say sorry?

00:03:34.047 --> 00:03:34.964
{\an8}Wait.

00:03:35.048 --> 00:03:37.634
{\an8}Aren't you going to apologize to Jerome?

00:03:42.931 --> 00:03:45.683
{\an8}Doc, if you're worried about Mia,

00:03:45.767 --> 00:03:47.644
{\an8}we'll speak to Jerome.

00:03:47.727 --> 00:03:51.022
{\an8}So he can also be held
accountable for hurting her.

00:03:51.105 --> 00:03:54.442
{\an8}Patrick, you've put
the hospital in a very tough position.

00:03:54.525 --> 00:03:57.737
{\an8}For sure, the hospital
will be implicated in this.

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.030
{\an8}Doc Anok?

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:01.866
{\an8}Tsk.

00:04:02.492 --> 00:04:06.120
{\an8}This is the second time you've had
an encounter at the hospital, Patrick.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.251
{\an8}First, when you talked back
to Congressman Martinez, now this.

00:04:12.794 --> 00:04:16.130
{\an8}I have no choice but
to suspend you for 10 days.

00:04:17.131 --> 00:04:18.216
{\an8}Without pay.

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:23.471
{\an8}

00:04:42.156 --> 00:04:44.117
You were really suspended?

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.159
Mm-hmm.

00:04:45.243 --> 00:04:46.202
Are you okay?

00:04:46.286 --> 00:04:48.246
I'm fine. At least I wasn't fired.

00:04:48.329 --> 00:04:49.914
What about you and Matmat?

00:04:50.707 --> 00:04:53.876
Maybe Doc will change
his mind if you apologize to Jerome.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.336
- Just say--
- Gemma.

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:58.464
It's what I wanted.

00:05:00.216 --> 00:05:01.217
You did it on purpose?

00:05:19.068 --> 00:05:21.279
You did it for Mia.

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:33.833
Patrick. Patrick!

00:05:34.709 --> 00:05:35.710
Patrick.

00:05:36.961 --> 00:05:39.881
Patrick, I'm sorry.

00:05:41.215 --> 00:05:44.302
Am I the reason you lost your job?

00:05:44.385 --> 00:05:45.970
Was it because of Jerome?

00:05:46.054 --> 00:05:48.931
Patrick, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

00:05:49.724 --> 00:05:51.934
No, Bella. I was only suspended.

00:05:53.936 --> 00:05:55.313
Still, Patrick.

00:05:55.396 --> 00:05:57.523
If Jerome hadn't come here,

00:05:57.607 --> 00:05:58.858
- then maybe…
- Patrick…

00:05:58.941 --> 00:06:01.277
- Maybe--
- Thank you.

00:06:02.153 --> 00:06:03.529
If you hadn't come,

00:06:03.613 --> 00:06:05.364
Jerome might have hurt Bella too.

00:06:05.448 --> 00:06:07.450
You were amazing, man!

00:06:08.076 --> 00:06:10.870
You were like an action star!

00:06:22.256 --> 00:06:24.801
What happened to him? Why is he smiling?

00:06:24.884 --> 00:06:25.885
Huh?

00:06:26.803 --> 00:06:27.887
He's not.

00:06:28.387 --> 00:06:32.225
Patrick is sad. He got suspended.

00:06:32.975 --> 00:06:33.976
Without pay.

00:06:34.977 --> 00:06:36.896
Poor guy.

00:06:38.022 --> 00:06:39.774
Doesn't look like it.

00:06:39.857 --> 00:06:42.318
I've never seen anyone
so happy after being suspended.

00:06:45.613 --> 00:06:47.532
You should apologize.

00:06:47.615 --> 00:06:49.408
Aren't
you going to apologize to Jerome?

00:06:49.492 --> 00:06:52.286
Maybe Doc will change his mind
if you apologize to Jerome.

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:53.621
But Gemma…

00:06:54.372 --> 00:06:55.706
That's what I wanted.

00:07:42.211 --> 00:07:43.463
Why are you smiling?

00:07:43.546 --> 00:07:44.964
Didn't you get punished?

00:07:46.799 --> 00:07:47.758
I'm suspended.

00:07:50.678 --> 00:07:52.305
And that's a good thing?

00:07:52.763 --> 00:07:54.974
Suspended without pay.

00:07:55.516 --> 00:07:57.727
And the guy I punched is pressing charges.

00:08:04.942 --> 00:08:06.319
Everything's a mess.

00:08:12.575 --> 00:08:13.451
You said…

00:08:14.702 --> 00:08:15.912
you'd leave everything behind

00:08:16.496 --> 00:08:19.624
if I just asked
you to run away from all this.

00:08:24.128 --> 00:08:25.171
You mean…

00:08:25.963 --> 00:08:26.881
Let's go?

00:08:36.641 --> 00:08:37.767
Let's run away?

00:08:49.111 --> 00:08:51.280
I know! Taiwan.

00:08:51.989 --> 00:08:54.242
It's close and
we don't need a travel visa.

00:08:58.663 --> 00:09:00.164
Is that a look of regret?

00:09:00.957 --> 00:09:03.834
You don't want us to leave together?

00:09:05.336 --> 00:09:06.379
No.

00:09:07.672 --> 00:09:10.216
I was just thinking
I left something behind.

00:09:11.133 --> 00:09:12.385
Patpat…

00:09:13.177 --> 00:09:14.303
Patpat…

00:09:15.471 --> 00:09:17.306
If you left something at the hospital,

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:18.975
don't worry about it.

00:09:20.101 --> 00:09:21.852
So? Taiwan?

00:09:25.147 --> 00:09:26.941
Mia, I don't have a passport.

00:09:28.568 --> 00:09:29.986
You don't have a passport?

00:09:30.987 --> 00:09:35.116
You're asking me to run away
but we can't even leave the Philippines?

00:09:35.199 --> 00:09:38.411
Mia, Matmat and
I never made it a priority.

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:42.540
Fine.

00:09:42.957 --> 00:09:44.542
We'll go to Montanesa.

00:09:45.042 --> 00:09:46.210
Montanesa?

00:09:46.752 --> 00:09:48.337
That's five hours away.

00:09:48.421 --> 00:09:52.091
I'll make it in four if I drive fast.

00:09:53.175 --> 00:09:57.847
Um, why don't we go to Aplaya instead?

00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:00.391
Aplaya? That's still in Maravida.

00:10:00.474 --> 00:10:03.394
But we've never been there.
Let's just get some fresh air.

00:10:04.353 --> 00:10:05.730
I can't stay…

00:10:06.731 --> 00:10:08.399
overnight anyway.

00:10:10.943 --> 00:10:11.902
What?!

00:10:16.032 --> 00:10:17.366
Mia, slow down.

00:10:19.076 --> 00:10:20.494
Answer me honestly.

00:10:20.578 --> 00:10:25.458
I've been planning all of this and now
you're saying you can't stay overnight?!

00:10:25.541 --> 00:10:27.668
Mia, I'm thinking of Matmat.

00:10:28.628 --> 00:10:29.629
What?!

00:10:34.175 --> 00:10:35.926
Mia, what are you doing?

00:10:36.761 --> 00:10:38.304
I'll drive this car off the cliff.

00:10:38.387 --> 00:10:39.180
What?!

00:10:39.263 --> 00:10:40.431
We'll die together!

00:10:40.514 --> 00:10:42.642
Mia, that's not funny! Mia!

00:10:43.976 --> 00:10:45.728
Mia, stop the car!

00:10:45.811 --> 00:10:47.480
Mia! Mia!

00:10:50.733 --> 00:10:52.360
Mia!

00:10:59.784 --> 00:11:01.118
What's wrong with you?!

00:11:01.827 --> 00:11:03.496
That's not a good joke!

00:11:05.206 --> 00:11:06.832
Do I look like I'm joking?!

00:11:07.792 --> 00:11:10.127
You don't make sense!

00:11:10.211 --> 00:11:13.422
You asked me to run away,
but you can't even stay long?

00:11:14.423 --> 00:11:16.217
What kind of vacation is that?!

00:11:17.009 --> 00:11:18.344
- Please understand--
- No!

00:11:18.427 --> 00:11:19.804
I will not listen to you!

00:11:19.887 --> 00:11:21.222
I am very angry!

00:11:23.015 --> 00:11:24.058
Get out.

00:11:27.269 --> 00:11:28.938
I said, get out!

00:11:31.232 --> 00:11:33.234
Get out!

00:12:10.521 --> 00:12:11.397
Hey.

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:15.067
Dear, do you want
me to add you to this dish?

00:12:15.943 --> 00:12:17.778
At least I won't be alone.

00:12:18.279 --> 00:12:19.405
Huh?

00:12:21.866 --> 00:12:22.908
Ma…

00:12:23.617 --> 00:12:25.744
Should I really move on?

00:12:27.037 --> 00:12:28.164
Sweetie.

00:12:28.247 --> 00:12:33.502
I wouldn't be rooting for Vincent
if there was still hope for Patrick.

00:12:34.003 --> 00:12:35.129
The thing is,

00:12:35.212 --> 00:12:37.506
there's nothing. It's hopeless.

00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:41.677
Was Papa your first love, Ma?

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:42.720
What?

00:12:42.803 --> 00:12:44.013
Why are you asking me that?

00:12:44.972 --> 00:12:48.267
Is Anok right around the corner?

00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:49.268
What?

00:12:49.894 --> 00:12:51.729
Oh, I was just asking.

00:12:51.812 --> 00:12:53.731
Why do you want to know?

00:12:53.814 --> 00:12:57.735
What's your Papa and
I got to do with your love life?

00:12:58.277 --> 00:13:00.029
Well for starters,

00:13:00.112 --> 00:13:02.490
if Papa wasn't your first love…

00:13:03.365 --> 00:13:05.159
How did you move on from your ex?

00:13:05.242 --> 00:13:07.369
How did you find
your happy ending with Papa?

00:13:08.329 --> 00:13:11.123
I have moved on.
I gave birth to you, right?

00:13:11.207 --> 00:13:12.458
So how did you do it?

00:13:13.918 --> 00:13:17.129
Well, when your Papa was here.

00:13:17.213 --> 00:13:22.843
He reminded me
that I had a lot of love to give.

00:13:22.927 --> 00:13:28.307
So why be selfish when
you have a lot of love in your heart?

00:13:32.228 --> 00:13:33.437
Bro!

00:13:34.271 --> 00:13:36.815
I got the vibe that you ran out,
so here you go.

00:13:36.899 --> 00:13:38.651
- I brought more.
- Nice. Leg part?

00:13:38.734 --> 00:13:40.903
Yeah, of course.
You already had some breast.

00:13:40.986 --> 00:13:42.071
Perfect. Thank you.

00:13:42.154 --> 00:13:43.572
Alright, enjoy.

00:13:48.911 --> 00:13:50.579
Bro, smile.

00:13:50.663 --> 00:13:51.914
- Smile!
- What are you doing?

00:13:51.997 --> 00:13:53.916
It's just a picture. Smile!

00:13:53.999 --> 00:13:55.084
There.

00:13:55.167 --> 00:13:57.586
I just want to immortalize this moment

00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:59.922
while you still have your appetite…

00:14:00.005 --> 00:14:01.632
…and you're still healthy.

00:14:01.715 --> 00:14:04.176
Because one of these days,
I'll need to get you checked.

00:14:05.594 --> 00:14:06.637
Why?

00:14:07.179 --> 00:14:10.307
I wasn't injured,
Mia and I didn't get into an accident.

00:14:10.391 --> 00:14:14.144
I wish you got hit so it'll
knock some sense into you.

00:14:14.228 --> 00:14:15.396
There. There it is.

00:14:15.479 --> 00:14:17.231
So you want me to get into an accident?

00:14:17.314 --> 00:14:19.942
Blah. Blah. Blah. You seem happy.

00:14:20.025 --> 00:14:21.443
Be honest with me.

00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:26.156
In your whole life,
you've never been suspended.

00:14:26.824 --> 00:14:28.158
And now you're happy about it?!

00:14:28.492 --> 00:14:31.245
And then you invited Mia
to go on a vacation with you?

00:14:31.537 --> 00:14:32.538
You're unbelievable.

00:14:33.289 --> 00:14:34.290
I don't know, bro.

00:14:35.207 --> 00:14:36.834
That's what I felt at the time.

00:14:36.917 --> 00:14:38.252
I know what it is, bro.

00:14:38.335 --> 00:14:40.546
Unfortunately,
I know what your problem is.

00:14:40.629 --> 00:14:41.630
What?

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:44.383
Miatitis.

00:14:44.466 --> 00:14:45.593
What?

00:14:45.676 --> 00:14:46.886
Miatitis!

00:14:47.845 --> 00:14:49.638
A disease you got from Mia.

00:14:49.722 --> 00:14:51.807
Give me your hand. See this?

00:14:51.891 --> 00:14:53.642
- Hurts, doesn't it?
- Ow!

00:14:53.726 --> 00:14:57.521
Ever since Mia cut your palm,
the stupidity started.

00:14:57.605 --> 00:15:00.065
It's a virus,
and it's spreading to your brain.

00:15:00.149 --> 00:15:01.859
Mia, Mia, ahh!

00:15:01.942 --> 00:15:03.319
You're crazy.

00:15:03.402 --> 00:15:04.737
Let's go apply for a passport.

00:15:06.947 --> 00:15:09.325
Where did that come from? No transitions?

00:15:10.117 --> 00:15:11.410
Let's go apply for a passport.

00:15:12.786 --> 00:15:14.121
Okay, sure. I'm game for that.

00:15:17.625 --> 00:15:20.586
Just to be sure,
we're not going to work abroad, right?

00:15:23.005 --> 00:15:24.006
For vacation.

00:15:28.928 --> 00:15:31.013
- Bro--
- Just let me do this.

00:15:31.096 --> 00:15:32.348
Ugh!

00:15:49.406 --> 00:15:50.866
Are you going to play, ma'am?

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:52.785
- Yes.
- Alright, ma'am.

00:16:04.672 --> 00:16:06.465
So pretty.

00:16:13.597 --> 00:16:15.307
Mmm, hi.

00:16:19.395 --> 00:16:20.688
Ugh!

00:16:33.450 --> 00:16:34.952
Ugh!

00:16:35.035 --> 00:16:37.454
You deserve that.

00:16:49.133 --> 00:16:50.718
Really? Vincent's courting Gemma?

00:16:50.801 --> 00:16:53.220
Dude, right in front of my face.
He's got a lot of nerve.

00:16:54.888 --> 00:16:56.765
Do you really like Gemma?

00:16:58.767 --> 00:17:00.686
Yeah, bro!

00:17:00.769 --> 00:17:04.189
You think I'm fooling
around when I call her 'pretty love'?

00:17:04.273 --> 00:17:07.109
There. That's why
Auntie Li doesn't take you seriously.

00:17:07.526 --> 00:17:08.944
But why? Why?

00:17:09.486 --> 00:17:12.865
It's a term of endearment.
I'm trying to be sweet to Gemma.

00:17:12.948 --> 00:17:14.992
Bro, just be yourself.

00:17:15.075 --> 00:17:17.536
And don't be cocky. She hates that.

00:17:17.619 --> 00:17:19.955
Bro, that's not me. I'm not cocky.

00:17:20.039 --> 00:17:21.874
- You know what type I am?
- What?

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.836
I'm the charming type. Right?

00:17:25.919 --> 00:17:27.504
I'm a low-key kind of guy.

00:17:27.588 --> 00:17:30.674
Vincent is the cocky one.
He gets all the attention.

00:17:31.258 --> 00:17:34.136
She'll notice you, too. Just be patient.

00:17:35.095 --> 00:17:38.390
Do you have plans tomorrow?
Are you going to open your restaurant?

00:17:39.433 --> 00:17:41.894
- I know you too well. Fine.
- I haven't said anything.

00:17:41.977 --> 00:17:46.398
Blah-blah. I've heard
that many times before.

00:17:46.482 --> 00:17:48.650
You have a favor and need to go elsewhere.

00:17:48.734 --> 00:17:50.903
If you need to go, just go.

00:17:50.986 --> 00:17:53.072
Go. Leave. Goodbye.

00:17:53.155 --> 00:17:54.239
Thank you, bro.

00:17:58.994 --> 00:18:01.830
- Mister Dipong.
- Forgive me. Did I scare you?

00:18:01.914 --> 00:18:03.582
Yeah.

00:18:03.665 --> 00:18:04.917
You're here early.

00:18:05.459 --> 00:18:08.962
Yeah. I'm scheduled to check the pipes.

00:18:09.463 --> 00:18:11.048
Have you had any
problems with the water supply?

00:18:11.673 --> 00:18:13.175
None so far. Have you eaten?

00:18:13.258 --> 00:18:16.804
Don't worry about me, Patrick.
I'm good. Thank you.

00:18:17.387 --> 00:18:20.724
By the way,
I found these letters by the gate.

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:23.727
There's an electricity bill in there.

00:18:24.895 --> 00:18:27.147
I'm surprised
people still send snail mail.

00:18:27.648 --> 00:18:30.567
Oh, yes. This town is still old-fashioned.

00:18:32.569 --> 00:18:34.404
- I'll get going.
- Okay.

00:18:35.948 --> 00:18:38.117
If you need something,

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:40.536
I'll be outside. Just call me.

00:18:40.994 --> 00:18:42.246
Okay.

00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:08.105
Mister Dipong!

00:19:08.188 --> 00:19:11.525
- Have a drink.
- Oh. Thank you.

00:19:13.235 --> 00:19:14.403
Thanks.

00:19:16.363 --> 00:19:17.739
Mister Dipong,

00:19:17.823 --> 00:19:19.616
what song were you humming earlier?

00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:22.536
You were humming
a tune before you cut the grass.

00:19:23.453 --> 00:19:26.665
Oh. I can't recall the title of the song.

00:19:26.748 --> 00:19:29.960
But I heard it from Ma'am Ingrid.

00:19:32.671 --> 00:19:33.964
Mia's mom?

00:19:34.631 --> 00:19:35.591
Yeah.

00:19:36.508 --> 00:19:37.843
It was her favorite.

00:19:38.677 --> 00:19:40.220
She used to always sing it.

00:19:46.727 --> 00:19:47.978
I've got to go.

00:20:15.255 --> 00:20:16.798
What is she doing there?

00:21:32.541 --> 00:21:34.710
- Ingrid?
- Ah!

00:21:34.793 --> 00:21:37.713
Argh!Argh!

00:21:46.513 --> 00:21:49.224
The living
are scarier than the dead.

00:21:50.851 --> 00:21:52.561
Where are you, Ingrid?

00:21:53.729 --> 00:21:54.980
Where could you be?

00:21:58.066 --> 00:21:59.401
We like the same things.

00:21:59.484 --> 00:22:02.696
Matmat is Mia Hernandez's best friend.

00:22:02.779 --> 00:22:04.865
Mia, let's talk.
Why are you throwing things at me?

00:22:04.948 --> 00:22:06.408
Are you coming with me somewhere far away?

00:22:06.491 --> 00:22:08.243
Mia. Hey!

00:22:08.327 --> 00:22:09.369
Don't talk to me.

00:22:09.453 --> 00:22:12.539
I was enraged when
I saw that you got hurt.

00:22:12.622 --> 00:22:15.167
He can't get enough of me.

00:22:15.250 --> 00:22:18.253
I think I'm losing my mind.
Maybe I'm crazy.

00:22:19.254 --> 00:22:20.630
Is that a bad thing?
