How many times do I have to tell you?

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:31.250
I'm sorry.

00:00:34.916 --> 00:00:35.916
Don't be scared.

00:00:39.083 --> 00:00:40.208
Sorry.

00:00:43.291 --> 00:00:45.291
Why do you always make me do this?

00:00:45.375 --> 00:00:47.750
I can't handle it, and then…

00:00:49.416 --> 00:00:51.250
I don't want this either, all right?

00:00:56.375 --> 00:01:00.000
How many years? Seven years…

00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:07.125
Sorry, it's my fault.

00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:20.000
Jin Jin.

00:01:21.625 --> 00:01:23.375
I can't face her.

00:01:36.416 --> 00:01:37.750
Hi.

00:01:37.833 --> 00:01:40.791
Mom, what're you up to?
What took you so long to answer?

00:01:40.875 --> 00:01:43.166
Nothing, I was just busy.

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.375
I'm at the hotel pool.
Let me show you the night view.

00:01:46.458 --> 00:01:47.958
It's stunning.

00:01:48.041 --> 00:01:49.291
I'm with An Chi.

00:01:49.833 --> 00:01:51.291
Hello, An Chi.

00:01:51.375 --> 00:01:52.583
Hello.

00:01:52.666 --> 00:01:54.916
You two be careful over there.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.500
Don't worry. We're not kids anymore.

00:01:57.583 --> 00:02:00.583
Mom, I've got to go.
I just called to let you know I'm fine.

00:02:00.666 --> 00:02:01.583
Okay.

00:02:01.666 --> 00:02:04.416
And I uploaded a new video on YouTube.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.916
Remember to hit like.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.125
Okay.

00:02:07.625 --> 00:02:09.041
I'm hanging up. Bye.

00:02:09.833 --> 00:02:11.791
- Bye bye.
- Bye bye.

00:02:33.416 --> 00:02:35.500
JIN JIN

00:02:46.916 --> 00:02:48.125
Come join us!

00:02:55.541 --> 00:02:57.458
Hsin-yi, are you coming or not?

00:02:57.541 --> 00:03:00.375
Just tell your mom
you're going to shoot videos with me.

00:03:00.458 --> 00:03:03.416
We can split the earnings
from videos and ads.

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.916
You can have fun and get paid.
How cool is that?

00:03:30.541 --> 00:03:32.708
Mom, I want to go to Benkha.

00:03:33.666 --> 00:03:34.750
What for?

00:03:35.541 --> 00:03:37.291
Jin Jin is there already.

00:03:37.375 --> 00:03:39.166
She keeps asking me to join her.

00:03:40.791 --> 00:03:42.791
There's still time before school starts.

00:03:42.875 --> 00:03:44.000
I can go on vacation.

00:03:46.875 --> 00:03:50.500
And I can film some content with them
and make some money.

00:03:53.875 --> 00:03:55.875
I told you not to worry about money.

00:03:57.333 --> 00:03:58.208
I'll handle it.

00:03:58.666 --> 00:03:59.500
But…

00:04:07.125 --> 00:04:08.750
- Go back inside.
- Okay.

00:04:08.833 --> 00:04:09.833
I'll finish up here.

00:04:41.791 --> 00:04:46.166
SCAMMERS GO TO HELL

00:05:21.458 --> 00:05:22.541
Officer Li!

00:05:23.125 --> 00:05:26.791
PRESENT DAY, BENKHA

00:05:31.583 --> 00:05:33.083
You want me to steal a corpse?

00:05:34.125 --> 00:05:35.500
Mm.

00:05:40.083 --> 00:05:43.708
Please. You think too highly of me.
I can't pull that off.

00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:46.958
You can, Mr. Li.

00:05:47.041 --> 00:05:49.583
Everyone in Chinatown knows
you're the go-to-guy.

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:53.333
You're handsome and kind-hearted.

00:05:53.916 --> 00:05:55.291
Help us out.

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:10.750
If you can meet this price,

00:06:10.833 --> 00:06:11.708
I'll do it.

00:06:16.125 --> 00:06:17.791
That's way too much.

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:25.583
No bargaining.

00:06:29.875 --> 00:06:31.541
Don't give me that look.

00:06:31.625 --> 00:06:33.750
Any idea how many people
I'll have to bribe?

00:06:33.833 --> 00:06:36.041
Most of that will go to the morgue.

00:06:36.125 --> 00:06:38.208
I'll barely have anything left.

00:06:38.791 --> 00:06:40.375
If you didn't look so desperate…

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:46.708
Whatever.
You've got time to think it over.

00:06:47.791 --> 00:06:49.750
Wait, fine…

00:06:50.916 --> 00:06:52.208
We'll pay.

00:06:52.291 --> 00:06:53.375
We'll find the money.

00:06:53.875 --> 00:06:54.708
We will.

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:57.083
Good.

00:06:58.458 --> 00:07:00.166
Come up with the money quickly.

00:07:00.625 --> 00:07:03.708
The body will be cremated in 72 hours.

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:05.333
Okay?

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:09.916
Don't you want to know why
we want to steal Chang Shih-kai's corpse?

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.750
If I ask you, will you tell me?

00:07:12.333 --> 00:07:14.125
If we do, can you lower the price?

00:07:16.166 --> 00:07:17.041
What do you think?

00:07:18.541 --> 00:07:19.375
In any case,

00:07:20.625 --> 00:07:22.083
you pay the money

00:07:23.375 --> 00:07:24.666
and I'll do the job.

00:07:25.541 --> 00:07:27.458
All right, you can go now.

00:07:27.541 --> 00:07:28.541
See yourselves out.

00:07:30.916 --> 00:07:33.333
Get the money quick. Time's running out.

00:08:05.208 --> 00:08:06.041
Who is it?

00:08:07.625 --> 00:08:08.458
Hsiang.

00:08:09.041 --> 00:08:10.166
Stop coming here.

00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:12.458
- Sorry.
- Don't apologize to me.

00:08:12.541 --> 00:08:14.958
If you're really sorry,
tell them to pay up.

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:16.958
I thought of you as a friend.

00:08:17.041 --> 00:08:20.458
So I listened to you
and bought that life insurance for my mom.

00:08:20.541 --> 00:08:23.875
Now my mother's in the ICU
and desperately needs the money!

00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:26.500
But your company won't pay out!

00:08:26.583 --> 00:08:27.833
I tried to get it back

00:08:27.916 --> 00:08:31.250
but they said it's an investment-based
policy and it's all gone!

00:08:31.333 --> 00:08:32.458
You know what you are?

00:08:32.541 --> 00:08:35.541
- You're a scammer!
- I'll make it up to you. Here's some…

00:08:35.625 --> 00:08:38.166
- No, I don't want it!
- Don't be so mean.

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:40.666
- I'm suing your company!
- She has it hard too.

00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:42.750
Karma will get you!

00:08:43.333 --> 00:08:45.500
Chao Ching, ignore him.
He doesn't mean it.

00:08:45.583 --> 00:08:46.666
She scammed us.

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:48.000
Don't say that.

00:08:48.416 --> 00:08:49.833
- It's not her fault.
- No?

00:08:49.916 --> 00:08:51.958
Karma will get her! Serves her right!

00:09:00.666 --> 00:09:02.291
Ching, there you are.

00:09:02.375 --> 00:09:03.208
Have a seat.

00:09:07.375 --> 00:09:09.208
Things must be tough for you lately.

00:09:10.333 --> 00:09:11.375
I'm fine.

00:09:11.458 --> 00:09:16.333
Why don't I transfer your clients
to Hsiao-chou for the time being?

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:20.416
I found those clients.
Why should I give them to her?

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:23.750
Precisely because
you worked so hard to get those clients.

00:09:23.833 --> 00:09:26.041
We should do our best to keep them.

00:09:26.541 --> 00:09:29.000
I'm worried
you're spreading yourself too thin,

00:09:29.083 --> 00:09:31.000
so I want Hsiao-chou to help you out.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.083
Without any clients,
how will I reach my sales target?

00:09:36.166 --> 00:09:39.333
Don't worry about that.
The company's taken it into account.

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:42.833
With your family's situation, the lawsuit,

00:09:42.916 --> 00:09:44.875
and dealing with those pesky reporters,

00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:46.333
it must be hard to focus.

00:09:46.416 --> 00:09:49.000
So we've decided to transfer you
to General Affairs.

00:09:49.083 --> 00:09:50.750
This will reduce your workload.

00:09:50.833 --> 00:09:52.791
You're demoting me?

00:09:52.875 --> 00:09:55.166
How will I survive on that salary?

00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:56.250
Don't worry.

00:09:56.333 --> 00:09:59.125
Once this matter is over,
you can transfer right back.

00:09:59.208 --> 00:10:00.791
I need money now more than ever.

00:10:00.875 --> 00:10:03.541
And the company
needs sales more than ever.

00:10:06.625 --> 00:10:08.458
The company always needs sales.

00:10:12.416 --> 00:10:15.333
To reach my sales targets
these past few years,

00:10:15.416 --> 00:10:18.541
I sold insurance policies
to many of my friends and family.

00:10:18.625 --> 00:10:20.541
But the company refused to pay up.

00:10:21.416 --> 00:10:24.583
Now everyone calls me a scammer.

00:10:25.125 --> 00:10:26.791
I gave a lot to this company.

00:10:26.875 --> 00:10:29.083
Now I'm being transferred
to General Affairs?

00:10:38.833 --> 00:10:40.041
Ching,

00:10:40.125 --> 00:10:43.458
that all happened
before I joined the company,

00:10:43.541 --> 00:10:45.083
so I know nothing about it.

00:10:45.166 --> 00:10:49.458
Besides, all of our products
comply with legal regulations now.

00:10:49.541 --> 00:10:51.250
- Are you saying
- This--

00:10:51.333 --> 00:10:52.875
the old products were illegal?

00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:54.500
Don't take it out on me.

00:10:54.583 --> 00:10:56.416
The company decided to transfer you.

00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:58.416
It had nothing to do with me.

00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:02.666
To put it bluntly, you want me to resign.

00:11:03.875 --> 00:11:05.916
That's nonsense.

00:11:07.333 --> 00:11:10.041
Look at all
that's happening to you right now.

00:11:10.583 --> 00:11:13.000
It must be hard to focus on your job.

00:11:13.083 --> 00:11:16.583
And our company
has always been very accommodating.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.416
Think about it some more.

00:11:20.083 --> 00:11:21.875
Where will you find another company

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:24.166
as good as this one?

00:11:25.166 --> 00:11:26.166
You know I'm right.

00:11:50.916 --> 00:11:51.916
What are you doing?

00:11:53.416 --> 00:11:55.875
The manager
asked me to sort your client files.

00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:57.208
Hsiao-chou.

00:11:57.291 --> 00:11:58.541
- Yes?
- Come here.

00:11:59.791 --> 00:12:00.833
Sorry.

00:12:06.541 --> 00:12:08.750
- Do it later.
- Didn't you tell Ching?

00:12:08.833 --> 00:12:09.791
It was so awkward.

00:12:30.208 --> 00:12:31.916
Did you just get back?

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.125
Traffic was terrible.

00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:36.958
I was swamped with work.
No time to pick you up.

00:12:38.416 --> 00:12:40.958
You don't need to take me
to the airport tomorrow.

00:12:41.041 --> 00:12:43.291
I don't trust a caregiver with Jin Jin.

00:12:43.375 --> 00:12:45.791
I'll go and renew my visa.

00:12:45.875 --> 00:12:48.250
I'll just get a taxi
and head over from there.

00:12:48.333 --> 00:12:49.333
Oh, okay.

00:12:54.041 --> 00:12:55.541
I'll just drop my things off.

00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:06.833
Don't you ever clean?

00:13:06.916 --> 00:13:08.416
I've been pretty busy lately.

00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:25.500
- Hey.
- I'm gonna shower.

00:13:25.583 --> 00:13:26.750
I have a meeting later.

You're on your own tonight.

Don't wait for me.

00:14:23.791 --> 00:14:25.083
Did you hear me?

00:14:25.791 --> 00:14:26.791
I heard you.

00:15:30.875 --> 00:15:33.041
Please take me
to Qiongyu Street in Tianmu.

00:16:53.791 --> 00:16:58.291
CHOU SHU-TING
ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT AWARD

00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:16.500
KUO CHIH-CHIEH'S CAMPAIGN STAFF MEMBER
GOES VIRAL FOR HER BEAUTY

00:17:23.458 --> 00:17:25.958
{\an8}CHOU SHU-TING
ADMITS POLITICS IS STRESSFUL,

00:17:26.041 --> 00:17:28.458
SUSPENDS WORK
FOR A YEAR-LONG STUDY TOUR

00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:13.291
I'm Hsu Yung, from Super News.
I'm doing an exclusive on fraud…

00:18:22.041 --> 00:18:22.875
Hello?

00:18:23.666 --> 00:18:26.708
Is this Hsu Yung,
the reporter for Super News?

00:18:28.208 --> 00:18:29.291
It's Chao Ching.

00:18:30.166 --> 00:18:31.333
I'm back in Taiwan.

00:18:41.625 --> 00:18:42.958
Were you drinking again?

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.416
Sentenced to death.

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:47.791
I wonder
what'll happen to the civil damages.

00:18:48.583 --> 00:18:50.333
- I'm feeling down.
- Give me a hand.

00:18:51.708 --> 00:18:53.166
Come and give me a hand.

00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:54.083
Oh.

00:18:58.333 --> 00:18:59.250
- Like this?
- Yes.

00:18:59.333 --> 00:19:00.541
One, two, three.

00:19:00.625 --> 00:19:01.958
Hey.

00:19:02.041 --> 00:19:03.291
Sorry.

00:19:11.708 --> 00:19:15.041
Help me contact a medical flight.

00:19:15.125 --> 00:19:18.208
I'm going to send Jin Jin back to Taiwan
in a few months.

00:19:18.291 --> 00:19:20.875
No problem. I'll arrange it right away.

00:19:27.666 --> 00:19:30.708
You haven't given me
this month's living expenses yet.

00:19:33.666 --> 00:19:35.208
Can we talk about this?

00:19:36.166 --> 00:19:39.750
Jin Jin made a lot
from that sponsored content.

00:19:41.125 --> 00:19:43.791
I don't think I need to keep paying.

00:19:43.875 --> 00:19:46.750
- I have lots of expenses myself.
- What kind of expenses?

00:19:47.375 --> 00:19:49.125
I'm doing business with a friend.

00:19:50.416 --> 00:19:55.416
I take care of all our household expenses
in Taiwan, don't I?

00:19:55.958 --> 00:19:57.375
Don't I contribute enough?

00:20:04.083 --> 00:20:06.041
I'm heading back to Taiwan tomorrow.

00:20:06.708 --> 00:20:09.333
- When will you be back?
- We'll see.

00:20:09.416 --> 00:20:12.083
Doubt I'll be in Southeast Asia
for work anytime soon.

00:20:12.166 --> 00:20:13.791
So you're saying

00:20:14.958 --> 00:20:16.708
I won't be seeing you or any money?

00:20:17.958 --> 00:20:20.458
That's not what I said. Or what I meant.

00:20:21.333 --> 00:20:23.500
I knew you'd get upset.

00:20:23.958 --> 00:20:27.625
I think we should make plans
for the future.

00:20:27.708 --> 00:20:29.791
He's dead now.

00:20:29.875 --> 00:20:31.958
Just let things come to an end.

00:20:32.041 --> 00:20:34.416
We need to let go
and stop punishing ourselves.

00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:36.875
We should move on.

00:20:36.958 --> 00:20:38.916
I think we should move on too.

00:20:44.166 --> 00:20:45.166
That's right.

00:20:45.250 --> 00:20:48.750
So, can we discuss
what I mentioned last time?

00:20:48.833 --> 00:20:50.000
Sure.

00:20:50.875 --> 00:20:53.625
Good. I want to make things clear.

00:20:53.708 --> 00:20:56.666
- So if we separate in the future--
- Not in front of Jin Jin.

00:20:57.625 --> 00:20:59.541
Okay, not now.

00:21:00.083 --> 00:21:02.291
- I'll do it.
- No, I'll do it myself.

00:21:03.125 --> 00:21:05.166
Okay, then let's talk at my hotel.

00:21:08.041 --> 00:21:09.208
Hua Hsin!

00:21:09.291 --> 00:21:11.666
- Hua Hsin makes dirty money!
- You scammers!

00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:13.833
- Swindlers!
- Scammers!

00:21:13.916 --> 00:21:16.375
- You exploit people!
- Pay us back!

00:21:16.458 --> 00:21:18.208
- Hua Hsin, pay up!
- Scammers, pay up!

00:21:18.291 --> 00:21:21.500
- Hua Hsin, pay up!
- Hua Hsin, give us back our money!

00:21:21.583 --> 00:21:23.333
Pay us back!

00:21:23.416 --> 00:21:25.333
- Come out and face us!
- Scammers!

00:21:26.958 --> 00:21:29.166
- Scammers!
- Hua Hsin, pay us back!

00:21:31.333 --> 00:21:32.791
Ching, you have a guest.

00:21:35.375 --> 00:21:37.875
Yes, I know your show
is incredible at exposés.

00:21:37.958 --> 00:21:39.833
My business card. Hsu Yung, Super News.

00:21:39.916 --> 00:21:41.333
You can just call me Yung.

00:21:41.416 --> 00:21:43.666
To help Super News get the truth,
I go super.

00:21:45.458 --> 00:21:46.958
Ching, there you are.

00:21:47.458 --> 00:21:48.541
- Mr. Hsu.
- Ching.

00:21:48.625 --> 00:21:51.583
Congratulations.
Justice has finally been served.

00:21:53.666 --> 00:21:54.500
By the way,

00:21:54.583 --> 00:21:58.083
Mr. Hsu said you two
have something to discuss today.

00:21:58.166 --> 00:22:00.875
Yes. But first,
I have to tender my resignation.

00:22:01.458 --> 00:22:02.333
What?

00:22:02.416 --> 00:22:03.500
Resignation?

00:22:03.583 --> 00:22:04.500
But…

00:22:05.583 --> 00:22:07.791
You're doing great.
Why would you resign?

00:22:09.041 --> 00:22:11.958
I feel the company's
been too accommodating.

00:22:12.041 --> 00:22:15.375
- I don't want to implicate the company.
- How can you say that?

00:22:15.458 --> 00:22:16.875
We're a family.

00:22:17.375 --> 00:22:21.041
And the company has always had your back.

00:22:21.125 --> 00:22:22.250
Hey.

00:22:22.333 --> 00:22:23.333
Don't rush things.

00:22:24.083 --> 00:22:25.208
Let's talk about it.

00:22:25.291 --> 00:22:26.583
Let's talk.

00:22:27.708 --> 00:22:28.750
Ms. Chou.

00:22:30.583 --> 00:22:32.166
Hsiao-chou, she called for you.

00:22:34.583 --> 00:22:37.458
- Mr. Hsu, please give me a moment.
- Take your time.

00:22:37.541 --> 00:22:39.416
Take good care of Mr. Hsu for me.

00:22:41.458 --> 00:22:43.833
Oh, remember to make some coffee.

00:22:46.791 --> 00:22:48.125
Go and make some coffee.

00:22:49.083 --> 00:22:50.750
- Mr. Hsu. Have a seat.
- Yes, yes.

00:23:08.125 --> 00:23:08.958
On the left.

00:23:15.958 --> 00:23:17.166
Sit anywhere you like.

00:23:19.708 --> 00:23:21.125
I'm gonna take a shower.

00:24:07.416 --> 00:24:08.416
Do you remember?

00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:09.833
I told you before

00:24:10.416 --> 00:24:12.208
how I wanted a fresh start

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.375
once the lawsuit was over.

00:24:15.875 --> 00:24:16.708
Did you?

00:24:17.208 --> 00:24:18.333
When was that?

00:24:18.416 --> 00:24:19.375
It doesn't matter.

00:24:20.208 --> 00:24:22.125
Anyway, now everything's wrapped up,

00:24:22.208 --> 00:24:23.916
I don't want to drag things on.

00:24:25.708 --> 00:24:27.208
I'm glad you think that way.

00:24:28.041 --> 00:24:30.125
At least Jin Jin won't suffer so much.

00:24:30.208 --> 00:24:33.125
The sooner her suffering ends,
the better for us, no?

00:24:33.208 --> 00:24:34.041
What do you mean?

00:24:35.791 --> 00:24:38.875
Aren't we talking about
turning off Jin Jin's life support?

00:24:41.583 --> 00:24:43.166
What were you talking about?

00:24:48.083 --> 00:24:50.750
For years,
we've been apart more often than not.

00:24:50.833 --> 00:24:52.416
We're married in name only.

00:24:53.541 --> 00:24:54.625
So you're aware?

00:24:55.416 --> 00:24:57.000
You finally realized.

00:24:58.500 --> 00:24:59.583
Let's get divorced.

00:25:02.791 --> 00:25:03.875
Divorced?

00:25:03.958 --> 00:25:04.833
Fine.

00:25:04.916 --> 00:25:06.125
What about Jin Jin?

00:25:06.208 --> 00:25:07.583
I'll take care of Jin Jin.

00:25:07.666 --> 00:25:10.375
Good. It's better for a child
to be with their mother.

00:25:10.958 --> 00:25:13.250
We'll do the paperwork back in Taiwan.

00:25:15.333 --> 00:25:17.458
Not so fast. I have a few conditions.

00:25:19.375 --> 00:25:20.375
What conditions?

00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:29.666
Ching, what do you want
to talk to that reporter for?

00:25:31.375 --> 00:25:33.083
He wants to interview me.

00:25:33.541 --> 00:25:35.500
Don't you always refuse interviews?

00:25:36.208 --> 00:25:37.208
I need the money.

00:25:37.708 --> 00:25:39.166
That's true.

00:25:39.250 --> 00:25:41.208
Super News has really high ratings.

00:25:42.041 --> 00:25:44.041
Remember to get a good price.

00:25:45.250 --> 00:25:47.958
- You must be having a hard time lately.
- What? No.

00:25:48.666 --> 00:25:51.125
Ever since you transferred me
to General Affairs,

00:25:51.208 --> 00:25:53.375
I've had a lot of time
on my hands at work.

00:25:54.166 --> 00:25:56.000
Sometimes, I'd get so bored

00:25:56.083 --> 00:25:58.958
that I'd dig out
the company's past internal records

00:25:59.041 --> 00:26:00.125
for a look.

00:26:01.416 --> 00:26:04.291
I discovered
that Fukang Universal Life Insurance

00:26:04.916 --> 00:26:06.458
was deemed high-risk.

00:26:06.541 --> 00:26:08.541
But when we promoted it externally,

00:26:08.625 --> 00:26:10.750
we labeled it a low-risk product.

00:26:10.833 --> 00:26:14.375
And customers were never told
of the possibility of loss of capital.

00:26:14.458 --> 00:26:16.333
This is straight-up fraud.

00:26:16.416 --> 00:26:19.041
What fraud?
Be careful about what you say.

00:26:19.125 --> 00:26:20.958
- This was before I joined--
- I know.

00:26:21.041 --> 00:26:23.250
That was before you joined the company.

00:26:23.833 --> 00:26:26.666
But now,
you'll have to take all the blame.

00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:28.000
It's so unfair on you.

00:26:28.458 --> 00:26:30.708
That's why I'll go on that show

00:26:30.791 --> 00:26:33.041
and apologize to everyone I scammed.

00:26:33.125 --> 00:26:36.708
I'm sure my unethical conduct

00:26:36.791 --> 00:26:38.750
- led to my daughter's tragic death.
- No.

00:26:38.833 --> 00:26:40.791
- Chao Ching--
- It's my karma.

00:26:40.875 --> 00:26:42.875
Chao Ching, what are you talking about?

00:26:42.958 --> 00:26:45.791
Do you know how much
this'll affect the company

00:26:45.875 --> 00:26:47.458
if you spout this crap on TV?

00:26:47.541 --> 00:26:48.541
Yes, I know.

00:26:49.625 --> 00:26:52.291
That's why I came in today to resign.

00:26:52.375 --> 00:26:53.208
But--

00:26:53.291 --> 00:26:55.416
I don't want to implicate the company.

00:27:00.791 --> 00:27:03.875
The money in our joint account
is from fundraisers for Jin Jin,

00:27:03.958 --> 00:27:06.125
so it should go towards for her expenses.

00:27:06.208 --> 00:27:07.583
How can we do that?

00:27:07.666 --> 00:27:10.083
That's a joint account.

00:27:10.166 --> 00:27:12.083
By law, we should split it, right?

00:27:15.458 --> 00:27:16.833
Then let's follow the law.

00:27:22.333 --> 00:27:24.458
This is Hsiao-pao when he was born.

00:27:26.083 --> 00:27:28.666
Haven't you always wanted a son?

00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:30.500
His nose is just like yours.

00:27:31.583 --> 00:27:34.750
This is him at one year old
out shopping with his mother.

00:27:34.833 --> 00:27:36.625
He doesn't make a fuss. So cute.

00:27:37.333 --> 00:27:39.375
And this is him at two years old.

00:27:39.458 --> 00:27:42.666
You guys celebrated his birthday
at the amusement park.

00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:45.666
He's a Sagittarius just like you.

00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:47.583
He'll grow up to be a scumbag too.

00:27:49.291 --> 00:27:50.875
Hsiao-pao is so cute.

00:27:51.416 --> 00:27:52.791
At five or six years old,

00:27:53.916 --> 00:27:55.750
he'll start elementary school.

00:27:57.916 --> 00:28:00.166
The apartment you bought is in Tianmu.

00:28:00.791 --> 00:28:02.541
Near an international school, no?

00:28:02.625 --> 00:28:05.208
I'll pay him a visit when I have time.

00:28:08.125 --> 00:28:12.750
When he's 12 or 13 in a few years,
he'll go online.

00:28:12.833 --> 00:28:15.875
Then he'll learn
that his sister is a famous YouTuber.

00:28:16.333 --> 00:28:19.958
Since I took over,
I think we've reached 500,000 subscribers.

00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:21.375
And then,

00:28:21.458 --> 00:28:23.750
I'll tell the whole world

00:28:23.833 --> 00:28:27.000
that his father is a scumbag
and his mother is a homewrecker.

00:28:27.458 --> 00:28:28.291
By the way,

00:28:29.333 --> 00:28:32.000
will this affect
Kuo Chih-chieh's election prospects?

00:28:34.250 --> 00:28:35.916
If you want to resign,

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.750
you need to sign
a non-disclosure agreement.

00:28:38.833 --> 00:28:41.166
- A non-disclosure agreement?
- Yes!

00:28:41.250 --> 00:28:42.625
After you sign it,

00:28:42.708 --> 00:28:45.791
you can't tell anyone
about anything related to the company.

00:28:45.875 --> 00:28:47.125
Do I have to sign it?

00:28:48.458 --> 00:28:49.416
Of course.

00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:50.791
What if I don't sign it?

00:28:50.875 --> 00:28:51.916
That's…

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.291
What exactly do you want?

00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:02.375
DIVORCE AGREEMENT

00:29:02.458 --> 00:29:04.000
I want all of your money

00:29:04.583 --> 00:29:06.333
and the apartment in Tianmu.

00:29:10.583 --> 00:29:11.625
Well,

00:29:11.708 --> 00:29:13.208
if you sign it,

00:29:13.291 --> 00:29:16.500
the company will compensate you.

00:29:16.583 --> 00:29:17.916
How much?

00:29:20.083 --> 00:29:22.166
I'll try my best, okay?
I'll try my best!

00:29:25.958 --> 00:29:27.875
Remember to get a good price.

00:29:27.958 --> 00:29:29.583
You said before

00:29:29.666 --> 00:29:31.708
that Super News has really high ratings.

00:29:34.666 --> 00:29:35.958
Hi.

00:29:41.958 --> 00:29:43.708
Please sign here.

00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:47.208
The apartment is in her name.

00:29:47.291 --> 00:29:49.166
- She won't agree.
- She will agree

00:29:49.250 --> 00:29:51.291
because she's also a mother now.

00:29:51.875 --> 00:29:55.083
For her child's sake, she'll compromise.

00:29:55.166 --> 00:29:57.375
I have to discuss it with her
back in Taipei.

00:29:57.458 --> 00:30:00.458
- I'll also need a lawyer--
- I don't have time for that.

00:30:07.625 --> 00:30:10.333
Do everything I've told you
as soon as possible.

00:30:10.416 --> 00:30:13.541
Sign this agreement tonight
and send it to me.

00:30:13.625 --> 00:30:14.791
Did you hear me?

00:30:16.291 --> 00:30:17.208
Yes.

00:30:17.291 --> 00:30:18.541
Her signature too.

00:30:24.041 --> 00:30:26.375
Take care of yourself
for the next two days.

00:30:26.458 --> 00:30:28.500
If you get into an accident on the road

00:30:29.375 --> 00:30:31.041
or get hit by a car,

00:30:31.625 --> 00:30:33.541
I'm still your insurance beneficiary.

00:30:52.666 --> 00:30:54.916
Didn't you say
not to touch Jin Jin's money?

00:30:55.541 --> 00:30:56.625
It's my ex-husband's.

00:30:57.458 --> 00:30:58.458
We got divorced.

00:31:02.250 --> 00:31:06.500
Let's make a to-do list.

00:31:06.583 --> 00:31:09.000
Then we'll see
what's missing and figure it out.

00:31:10.125 --> 00:31:12.083
First is money.

00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:14.833
Chang Shih-kai.

00:31:15.708 --> 00:31:16.875
Where to hide him?

00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:19.458
Transport.

00:31:20.416 --> 00:31:23.125
We need to control him once we have him.

00:31:27.625 --> 00:31:31.041
TO-DO LIST: MONEY, CHANG SHIH-KAI,
LOCATION, TRANSPORT, CONTROL

00:31:31.125 --> 00:31:33.250
We have to pay Mr. Li tonight.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.750
Do you think we can trust him?

00:31:45.166 --> 00:31:46.083
I've asked around.

00:31:46.166 --> 00:31:48.333
As long as he's paid,
he gets the job done.

00:31:48.416 --> 00:31:50.000
He has an excellent reputation.

00:31:56.083 --> 00:31:58.541
CHANG SHIH-KAI

00:31:59.416 --> 00:32:00.250
Here.

00:32:16.666 --> 00:32:17.500
Okay.

00:32:18.208 --> 00:32:19.041
Okay.

00:32:19.125 --> 00:32:20.791
Up. Okay.

00:32:25.583 --> 00:32:27.500
That's it. Okay.

00:32:39.708 --> 00:32:41.083
CHANG SHIH-KAI

00:32:49.541 --> 00:32:50.541
All done.

00:32:54.708 --> 00:32:57.000
CHANG SHIH-KAI

00:32:57.083 --> 00:32:58.583
After we get Chang Shih-kai,

00:32:58.666 --> 00:33:00.000
where should we hide him?

00:33:10.375 --> 00:33:13.666
This place is big
and seems private enough.

00:33:14.916 --> 00:33:17.000
This side is Pong's pharmacy.

00:33:17.083 --> 00:33:19.041
On the left is a bar.

00:33:20.375 --> 00:33:22.041
Wonder how soundproof it is.

00:33:33.208 --> 00:33:36.125
Fuck you!

00:33:46.041 --> 00:33:47.458
- Hey!
- Hi!

00:33:48.041 --> 00:33:49.916
Hey! You came!

00:33:51.666 --> 00:33:54.041
CAN'T HEAR ANYTHING

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:06.833
Hui-chun!

00:34:08.875 --> 00:34:09.708
Hui-chun!

00:34:10.375 --> 00:34:11.208
Hui-chun!

00:34:14.083 --> 00:34:15.375
Hi, Pong.

00:34:15.458 --> 00:34:16.500
What happened?

00:34:16.583 --> 00:34:18.500
I hear Hui-chun screaming all the time.

00:34:18.583 --> 00:34:19.875
I don't know what happened.

00:34:27.250 --> 00:34:28.250
What is it, Pong?

00:34:29.541 --> 00:34:30.416
What happened?

00:34:31.458 --> 00:34:32.458
What happened?

00:34:33.083 --> 00:34:34.041
Nothing.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:37.833
Nothing.

00:34:41.958 --> 00:34:42.791
Okay.

00:34:44.541 --> 00:34:45.375
Okay.

00:34:46.333 --> 00:34:47.166
Good night.

00:34:55.041 --> 00:34:56.250
The bar is fine.

00:34:56.833 --> 00:35:00.375
The last thing is Pong's pharmacy.

00:35:00.458 --> 00:35:03.291
What do we do?
That'll cost a ton of money.

00:35:05.083 --> 00:35:07.083
We're burning through it too quickly.

00:35:09.041 --> 00:35:10.791
Now we…

00:35:13.791 --> 00:35:14.666
Hey, Pong.

00:35:21.333 --> 00:35:22.541
Hey.

00:35:23.333 --> 00:35:24.916
I've got a cheap alternative.

00:35:30.375 --> 00:35:31.208
Pong!

00:35:31.291 --> 00:35:33.791
- No--
- It's okay. Don't worry. Just a few days.

00:35:33.875 --> 00:35:35.916
Please take care of my store for me, okay?

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.125
- Okay.
- Thank you.

00:35:44.458 --> 00:35:46.125
Are you sure about this?

00:35:46.208 --> 00:35:47.041
I've asked.

00:35:47.125 --> 00:35:50.291
Drug offenses
just get a few days in detention here.

00:35:50.375 --> 00:35:52.375
All clear. Let's go. Okay.

00:35:53.416 --> 00:35:54.500
Let's go.

00:36:06.083 --> 00:36:07.125
Let's get started.

00:36:07.625 --> 00:36:09.875
LOCATION

00:36:31.333 --> 00:36:33.041
TRANSPORT

00:36:37.208 --> 00:36:38.708
Getting there is fine.

00:36:38.791 --> 00:36:40.625
Bringing him back will be tricky.

00:36:41.625 --> 00:36:42.833
There's got to be a way.

00:36:46.250 --> 00:36:49.041
ESTAZOLAM

00:36:58.166 --> 00:36:59.333
More, more, more.

00:36:59.416 --> 00:37:00.541
How about now?

00:37:10.416 --> 00:37:12.041
Up, up.

00:37:42.041 --> 00:37:43.291
Everything is ready.

00:37:45.291 --> 00:37:46.291
We can begin.

00:37:50.333 --> 00:37:51.916
LOCATION, TRANSPORT, CONTROL

00:37:53.458 --> 00:37:57.625
AN EYE FOR AN EYE,
A TOOTH FOR A TOOTH

00:39:36.250 --> 00:39:37.250
Is anyone here?

00:39:38.583 --> 00:39:39.541
What is it?

00:39:41.791 --> 00:39:42.750
Go!

00:39:42.833 --> 00:39:43.666
Go, go!

00:39:44.208 --> 00:39:45.625
I want a glass of juice.

00:39:45.708 --> 00:39:47.541
No. We're closed already.

00:39:47.625 --> 00:39:49.291
This. Orange juice.

00:39:49.375 --> 00:39:50.666
- No.
- Drink.

00:39:50.750 --> 00:39:52.250
Tell him to quiet down.

00:39:52.333 --> 00:39:54.000
- Okay. Go.
- Cup.

00:39:54.083 --> 00:39:55.291
Cup!

00:39:59.333 --> 00:40:00.333
Hurry, I'm thirsty.

00:40:04.166 --> 00:40:05.500
Go, go, go.

00:40:06.958 --> 00:40:08.083
Where's the ice?

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:10.000
Ice!

00:40:10.583 --> 00:40:12.833
I want to drink something cold with ice.

00:40:12.916 --> 00:40:13.916
Hey!

00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:15.500
What the hell?

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.125
- Okay.
- What kind of place doesn’t use ice?

00:40:19.208 --> 00:40:22.833
How am I supposed to drink this?
Who sells drinks without ice?

00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:26.125
Hey! I want to drink something cold!

00:40:27.916 --> 00:40:29.000
I'm thirsty!

00:40:36.208 --> 00:40:38.500
Hurry up, I’m thirsty.

00:40:52.833 --> 00:40:53.833
Thank you.

00:40:55.375 --> 00:40:56.375
Bye!

00:41:05.750 --> 00:41:07.416
Oh, my God.

00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:09.166
Think he'll get diarrhea?

00:41:10.125 --> 00:41:11.125
Who cares?

00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:35.791
I can't. This kind of music makes me cry.

00:42:36.958 --> 00:42:39.125
Why would a song make you cry?

00:42:41.958 --> 00:42:43.958
I hardly ever see you cry.

00:42:44.041 --> 00:42:45.708
Of course I cry.

00:42:46.833 --> 00:42:47.833
When?

00:42:51.416 --> 00:42:52.625
When Hsin-yi died.

00:42:54.125 --> 00:42:55.125
And…

00:42:57.041 --> 00:42:58.458
when my husband died.

00:42:59.125 --> 00:43:01.375
I rarely hear you talk about your husband.

00:43:01.458 --> 00:43:04.833
It wasn't some passionate romance.
It's not worth mentioning.

00:43:06.916 --> 00:43:08.083
How did you two meet?

00:43:09.375 --> 00:43:12.708
He used to come to Kuala Lumpur for work.

00:43:13.291 --> 00:43:15.041
I thought he was quite nice.

00:43:15.125 --> 00:43:16.750
He gave me a sense of security.

00:43:16.833 --> 00:43:18.291
And then we got together.

00:43:18.833 --> 00:43:20.166
And then?

00:43:20.250 --> 00:43:23.000
I dropped everything,
got married and moved to Taiwan.

00:43:24.083 --> 00:43:25.458
Then what happened?

00:43:26.125 --> 00:43:28.833
I had Hsin-yi
and the three of us lived our lives.

00:43:28.916 --> 00:43:29.958
That's it.

00:43:32.541 --> 00:43:33.791
How did he die?

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:35.916
Cancer.

00:43:44.458 --> 00:43:46.916
Ever since I learned about the Goddess,

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:49.666
the person I wanted
to revive the most wasn't Hsin-yi.

00:43:50.666 --> 00:43:51.750
It was my husband.

00:43:53.166 --> 00:43:54.500
Why not Hsin-yi?

00:43:57.625 --> 00:44:00.208
Even if she was revived,
she'd only have seven days.

00:44:01.375 --> 00:44:03.666
The burden of knowing
your death is imminent

00:44:05.208 --> 00:44:06.708
is too cruel…

00:44:08.833 --> 00:44:09.916
for a young girl.

00:44:12.250 --> 00:44:15.208
But my husband was different.
He was amazing.

00:44:16.333 --> 00:44:18.333
When he found out he had cancer,

00:44:18.416 --> 00:44:21.000
the doctor told him
he had three months left.

00:44:21.083 --> 00:44:22.750
He actually kept it from me.

00:44:24.125 --> 00:44:25.833
He happily got on with life

00:44:25.916 --> 00:44:28.375
as if nothing had happened.

00:44:29.666 --> 00:44:32.000
Then one day, he passed out at home.

00:44:32.625 --> 00:44:35.208
I took him to the hospital and found out.

00:44:36.166 --> 00:44:37.625
After that,

00:44:38.458 --> 00:44:39.583
he never

00:44:41.166 --> 00:44:42.625
woke up again.

00:44:43.916 --> 00:44:46.583
I didn't get the chance
to speak to him one last time.

00:44:48.125 --> 00:44:49.625
Why did he keep it from you?

00:44:51.041 --> 00:44:53.333
He was probably worried
I couldn't take it.

00:44:54.583 --> 00:44:56.416
He kept working hard,

00:44:56.500 --> 00:44:59.500
hoping to save enough money
for me and Hsin-yi.

00:45:00.083 --> 00:45:01.750
So he refused treatment.

00:45:02.541 --> 00:45:05.375
Your husband was such a good man.

00:45:09.291 --> 00:45:11.041
But I couldn't fulfill his wishes.

00:45:11.666 --> 00:45:13.166
When he was dying,

00:45:13.958 --> 00:45:16.125
I spent all of our money on his treatment.

00:45:17.125 --> 00:45:20.166
Even my mother-in-law
urged me not to waste money.

00:45:20.250 --> 00:45:22.208
The doctor said his chances were slim.

00:45:22.916 --> 00:45:24.250
But I wouldn't listen.

00:45:25.666 --> 00:45:27.125
I wanted him to wake up.

00:45:31.708 --> 00:45:33.375
If he woke up,

00:45:33.458 --> 00:45:35.083
what would you say to him?

00:45:37.666 --> 00:45:39.666
I'd probably yell at him for a bit.

00:47:04.958 --> 00:47:07.916
If you can't help them, let them die.

00:47:11.375 --> 00:47:14.500
The Goddess says she cannot
feel the living's longing for him

00:47:14.583 --> 00:47:16.166
and cannot resurrect him.

00:47:16.250 --> 00:47:17.208
What?

00:47:17.291 --> 00:47:18.416
How can that be?

00:47:19.083 --> 00:47:20.041
Please leave.

00:47:20.125 --> 00:47:21.291
Goddess,

00:47:21.875 --> 00:47:23.500
please, try--

00:47:47.166 --> 00:47:48.166
Sorry.

00:47:55.208 --> 00:47:57.291
I got our daughter killed.

00:47:59.625 --> 00:48:01.625
Back then,

00:48:01.708 --> 00:48:03.333
if I had listened to you

00:48:03.416 --> 00:48:05.416
and not spent all that money,

00:48:09.291 --> 00:48:11.583
our lives wouldn't have been so tough…

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:16.291
and this wouldn't have happened to
Hsin-yi.

00:48:18.708 --> 00:48:20.541
I'm so scared.

00:48:22.166 --> 00:48:23.125
That's why

00:48:24.458 --> 00:48:26.166
I need you to wake up.

00:48:29.875 --> 00:48:32.166
So I can say goodbye to you properly.

00:48:39.666 --> 00:48:41.750
I'm all on my own now.

00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:45.458
I miss you so much.
