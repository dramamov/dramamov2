kissasia.cam or kisskh.org

02:02.039 --> 02:03.165
Stay seated.

02:04.708 --> 02:06.919
Don't do that please.
Give it up. Thank you.

02:19.056 --> 02:20.182
See you.

02:20.265 --> 02:22.267
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. Have a good day.

02:28.524 --> 02:29.942
963 to Base.

02:30.025 --> 02:32.236
Clifton Road dropped. Over.

02:32.319 --> 02:33.987
Copy that, 963.

02:43.830 --> 02:47.084
Fight! Fight!

02:50.671 --> 02:52.589
Bye. Thanks.

02:52.673 --> 02:53.757
You're welcome.

03:04.184 --> 03:07.187
Hey. Quit messing with the windows please.

03:09.648 --> 03:11.191
963 to Base.

03:11.733 --> 03:13.443
All kids dropped. Over.

03:13.527 --> 03:15.028
Copy that, 963.

03:33.672 --> 03:35.757
Meanwhile,
the Mavericks broke their losing streak

03:35.841 --> 03:39.845
with a resounding win
over the Wizards, 119-100.

03:39.928 --> 03:42.181
Weather today, sunny, dry and windy.

03:42.264 --> 03:44.808
Still no sign of an end
to this record dry spell.

03:44.892 --> 03:47.311
Day 210 without a drop of rain.

03:47.394 --> 03:48.395
And don't forget,

03:48.478 --> 03:51.773
there's a Red Flag Wildfire Warning
in effect for Butte County

03:51.857 --> 03:53.859
and surrounding areas through Friday,

03:53.942 --> 03:56.528
with the possibility
of electrical shutoffs.

03:56.612 --> 03:59.865
Looking ahead, you guessed it,
even more dry and windy weather

03:59.948 --> 04:04.203
in store tomorrow with gusts
anywhere from 60 to 80 miles per hour.

04:04.703 --> 04:06.205
In local news, after going eight--

04:17.673 --> 04:20.219
Hey, what do I need for Billie Park?
Who can I get?

04:21.094 --> 04:22.095
Try 190.

04:22.888 --> 04:23.889
Great.

04:26.391 --> 04:28.393
- This is Base. You there, Mack?
- What do you need?

04:28.477 --> 04:30.562
Yeah. Can you do the Billie Park
pickup today? Phil's bailed.

04:30.646 --> 04:32.648
- No problem, Chief.
- Thank you so much.

04:32.731 --> 04:34.733
Base clear. Hey, Kevin.

04:35.317 --> 04:37.069
- Yeah?
- Got those time sheets for me?

04:37.152 --> 04:40.656
No. I'll make sure
to bring 'em in tomorrow.

04:40.739 --> 04:42.741
Okay. And the foreman says
you're behind on maintenance.

04:42.824 --> 04:44.201
That's your responsibility.

04:44.284 --> 04:45.285
- Yeah?
- Copy that.

04:45.786 --> 04:48.789
Hi there. This is Ruby
at the Unified Transportation District.

04:51.625 --> 04:52.501
Yeah.

04:53.168 --> 04:54.920
- Hey, boss.
- Yeah. Just a sec.

04:56.338 --> 04:58.340
Hey there. It's Ruby down at the bus yard.

04:58.423 --> 05:02.010
I was just wondering if you knew
anything about the PG&E shutoffs.

05:02.094 --> 05:05.514
We got a Red Flag Warning, so I just need
to know if the schools are gonna close.

05:05.597 --> 05:06.431
Yeah, I'll hold.

05:06.515 --> 05:08.851
- What's up?
- About those additional shifts.

05:09.726 --> 05:11.603
I could sure use the extra this month.

05:11.687 --> 05:14.898
I've got my dad's medical bills.
I'm taking care of my mom.

05:14.982 --> 05:16.066
My ex is home.

05:16.149 --> 05:17.818
So it's a bit of a sticky time.

05:17.901 --> 05:19.820
Yeah, I just don't have
anything for you, Kevin.

05:19.903 --> 05:21.363
Well, boss, when I signed up, you said…

05:21.446 --> 05:22.948
I said maybe, yeah?

05:23.031 --> 05:26.076
And people that have been here longer,
the guys that have seniority,

05:26.159 --> 05:28.412
- they get first pick of overtime shifts.
- Hey, buddy. Hurry it up.

05:28.495 --> 05:30.497
- Mind your business, old man.
- Hey.

05:31.790 --> 05:33.959
If anything comes up, I'll let you know.

05:34.042 --> 05:35.043
Do you copy?

05:38.130 --> 05:39.131
Copy.

05:43.093 --> 05:44.720
I'm not staying on the line.

05:44.803 --> 05:45.804
Richard, I am so sorry.

05:45.888 --> 05:46.972
It's okay.

06:22.466 --> 06:24.801
- Yeah.
- Hey, Kevin. It's Dr. Everett.

06:25.427 --> 06:27.221
We got Elvis's X-rays back.

06:27.304 --> 06:28.805
Bad news, I'm afraid.

06:29.431 --> 06:31.850
His cancer has spread.

06:31.934 --> 06:33.227
I think it's time.

06:33.727 --> 06:36.730
All right, doc.
I'll bring him by tonight. Thank you.

06:36.813 --> 06:38.482
Hey, bud. How you doing?

06:39.316 --> 06:41.568
Come here. Come here, buddy.

06:41.652 --> 06:42.778
Come here.

06:43.487 --> 06:45.364
Come here.

06:45.447 --> 06:46.448
Hop up.

06:47.449 --> 06:49.368
I got ya.

06:53.413 --> 06:55.415
You want a burger for dinner, buddy?

06:56.291 --> 06:57.292
Huh?

06:59.211 --> 07:00.587
I got you, buddy.

07:03.882 --> 07:05.634
- Hey, Ma.
- Hey, Kevin.

07:10.597 --> 07:12.349
There you go, buddy.

07:12.933 --> 07:13.767
There you go.

07:14.601 --> 07:15.727
Shaun's home.

07:16.603 --> 07:18.689
- Home?
- He said he was sick.

07:19.648 --> 07:20.816
And you believed him?

07:23.277 --> 07:25.779
All I need is the school board
on my ass now.

07:29.116 --> 07:30.284
You okay?

07:32.578 --> 07:33.579
Struggling, Ma.

07:35.747 --> 07:37.249
I can't seem to catch a break.

07:39.168 --> 07:41.170
So, what, back to Reno?

07:41.920 --> 07:42.921
No.

07:43.672 --> 07:44.882
I just…

07:45.799 --> 07:47.301
I just can't make it here.

07:47.384 --> 07:49.303
Well, you know your dad did.

07:50.137 --> 07:51.805
Yeah. Well, I'm not him, remember?

08:01.481 --> 08:02.858
School's important, bud.

08:03.567 --> 08:05.152
Wasn't important to you.

08:08.614 --> 08:09.781
Lay down.

08:10.365 --> 08:12.242
Buddy, that's different.

08:12.743 --> 08:15.412
- Dropped out, yeah?
- Yeah. I did.

08:16.622 --> 08:19.041
We got pregnant. I had to.

08:20.709 --> 08:22.294
- So it's my fault then?
- No.

08:22.377 --> 08:24.171
It's not your fault, bud.

08:24.254 --> 08:27.007
I just…
I don't want you making my mistakes.

08:27.090 --> 08:28.258
That's all.

08:28.967 --> 08:32.971
Come on. Unpack your bags.
Put your stuff in a proper drawer.

08:33.054 --> 08:34.515
I'm off this Saturday.

08:34.597 --> 08:36.642
You and I can do something this weekend.

08:36.725 --> 08:37.893
I'm good.

08:37.976 --> 08:39.311
I don't feel well.

08:41.230 --> 08:42.648
Talk to me, buddy.

08:43.232 --> 08:44.316
Talk to me.

08:49.696 --> 08:51.323
You think I wanna be here?

08:51.406 --> 08:53.534
You think I wanna be here
taking care of your grandma?

08:53.617 --> 08:55.202
All right. But you… Don't…

08:55.285 --> 08:58.288
Hey. Listen to me.
I don't have a choice. You do.

08:58.372 --> 08:59.998
Dad, it's not fair
that I have to change my life.

09:00.082 --> 09:01.083
Grow up!

09:02.209 --> 09:03.460
Wait till you gotta pay bills!

09:03.544 --> 09:06.338
Wait till you got a job
that's a dead-end motherfucker,

09:06.421 --> 09:08.423
that doesn't pay, and you can't quit.

09:08.507 --> 09:10.551
You know what it's like
to not have some pity party?

09:10.634 --> 09:11.802
You know what it's like not

09:11.885 --> 09:13.512
- to have something to look forward to?
- Yeah, I do.

09:13.595 --> 09:16.181
- Well, how the fuck do you know?
- I know because of you.

09:20.352 --> 09:21.353
This is my fault now?

09:21.436 --> 09:22.938
Of course it's not, Dad.

09:24.648 --> 09:25.649
Never is.

09:29.611 --> 09:31.029
You know, I fucking hate you.

09:31.780 --> 09:32.948
I wish you were dead!

10:01.310 --> 10:02.311
Okay, buddy.

10:06.773 --> 10:09.151
- Good boy.
- You had him long?

10:09.902 --> 10:11.069
Since he was a puppy.

10:15.115 --> 10:17.451
- Do you wanna hold him?
- Yeah.

10:19.369 --> 10:20.454
It's okay, buddy.

10:21.496 --> 10:22.539
It's okay, buddy.

10:23.415 --> 10:24.416
It's okay.

10:25.292 --> 10:26.502
It's okay, buddy.

11:27.062 --> 11:29.606
…weather now,
and it's another dry and windy day

11:29.690 --> 11:33.360
in Paradise with gusts in the canyon
up to 80 miles per hour.

11:33.443 --> 11:37.281
That Red Flag Wildfire Warning is
still in effect, so be careful out there,

11:37.364 --> 11:40.492
and be sure to report
any signs of smoke or fire immediately.

11:40.576 --> 11:41.577
Looking at tomorrow--

11:47.499 --> 11:49.585
Hey, guys. We got a couple of downed trees

11:49.668 --> 11:51.503
in these winds on Roe Road.

11:51.587 --> 11:55.591
That's Roe Road,
so just… Watch out for power lines too.

11:56.592 --> 11:57.676
All right. Base out.

12:00.387 --> 12:02.139
- Hey, Kevin.
- Hey, boss.

12:02.222 --> 12:03.473
Mechanic's in this morning,

12:03.557 --> 12:06.185
so I want you to get 963 serviced
when you get back.

12:06.268 --> 12:07.686
Well past three K limit.

12:07.769 --> 12:09.646
I want you to stick around,
watch him do his checks.

12:09.730 --> 12:12.316
It's gonna take a couple hours,
but it's stuff you gotta know.

12:12.399 --> 12:13.817
- All right?
- Copy that, boss.

12:14.526 --> 12:15.944
There's yesterday's time sheet.

12:16.028 --> 12:17.029
Thank you, sir.

12:18.405 --> 12:19.740
Pleasure doing business.

13:14.336 --> 13:16.129
- Fire and Rescue.
- Yeah. Hey.

13:16.213 --> 13:18.382
I'm out on Highway 70 by the Pulga Bridge.

13:18.882 --> 13:21.635
Looks like some sort of a grass fire
on the west side of the canyon,

13:21.718 --> 13:23.303
and it's really blowing out here.

13:23.387 --> 13:24.930
Okay. Highway 70 near Pulga Bridge.

13:25.013 --> 13:27.015
Hold on one moment for me, sir.

13:33.105 --> 13:34.857
Okay, I think I see what you're seeing.

13:35.399 --> 13:38.151
Thank you for the report. We will get
the fire department on the way, okay?

13:46.243 --> 13:48.620
He's got arms the size of your thighs.

13:49.329 --> 13:50.289
He's like this.

13:54.251 --> 13:56.003
Jarbo Gap. Vegetation fire.

13:56.086 --> 13:59.590
Engine 2161, Engine 2176,
reported vegetation fire

13:59.673 --> 14:01.508
at Highway 70 near the Pulga Bridge.

14:01.592 --> 14:02.593
Please respond.

14:03.760 --> 14:07.598
Oroville, Engine 2161,
Engine 2176 responding.

14:08.640 --> 14:11.351
Up, Simbas! Let's go, we got work…

14:12.603 --> 14:14.438
Let's go.

14:15.230 --> 14:17.232
Five more minutes, I'd have breakfast.

14:49.223 --> 14:50.724
- Good Morning.
- Morning.

14:54.102 --> 14:55.437
- Good Morning.
- Morning.

15:23.590 --> 15:25.175
Okay. Come on. Clear.

15:48.782 --> 15:52.035
It's gotta be a failed cable.
Right underneath those towers.

15:54.371 --> 15:56.456
You know,
getting to it is gonna be the problem.

16:02.754 --> 16:03.755
What about there?

16:06.091 --> 16:07.759
Can we even get our rigs in there?

16:08.468 --> 16:10.220
It's tight, but let's give it a shot.

16:10.304 --> 16:11.930
All right. Let's back 'em up!

16:12.014 --> 16:13.557
- Let's move.
- Go.

16:32.701 --> 16:34.786
Can't talk right now, Ma.
I'll call you right back.

16:34.870 --> 16:37.039
Okay. Let's go. Go.

16:38.916 --> 16:39.917
See you later.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.168
- Thank you.
- Bye.

16:44.755 --> 16:46.131
- Thank you.
- Bye.

16:46.882 --> 16:48.217
Uh-huh, see ya.

16:48.300 --> 16:50.719
- Thank you. Have a great day.
- Have a good day.

17:03.649 --> 17:05.817
Watch out on this side.
The road can't take the weight.

17:05.901 --> 17:06.818
Yeah, I see that.

17:06.902 --> 17:08.904
2176, 2161.

17:08.987 --> 17:11.656
Just be careful on the right.
Looks a little shaky.

17:11.740 --> 17:12.699
Copy that, cap.

17:15.452 --> 17:16.954
All right. Heavy smoke ahead.

17:17.037 --> 17:18.204
Don't know about this.

17:18.288 --> 17:19.289
Let's stick with it.

17:19.373 --> 17:21.791
Let's knock this thing out
before it becomes something.

17:23.042 --> 17:23.919
Geez.

17:27.422 --> 17:28.257
Yeah, Ma.

17:28.339 --> 17:30.050
I've been trying to get a hold of you.

17:30.133 --> 17:31.802
Shaun's throwing up.

17:31.885 --> 17:33.512
He's really not well.

17:33.595 --> 17:34.763
Shit.

17:37.224 --> 17:38.517
Does he have a fever?

17:38.600 --> 17:40.936
I don't know. He's in the bathroom.

17:41.019 --> 17:42.521
963, Base calling. Do you read?

17:42.604 --> 17:44.106
Hang on a second, Ma.

17:44.189 --> 17:45.941
Base, this is 963.

17:46.024 --> 17:47.901
Have you completed drop-off yet?

17:47.985 --> 17:49.820
Yes, boss. Drop-off complete.

17:49.903 --> 17:52.656
Bring her on in then.
The mechanic's waiting for you.

17:52.739 --> 17:54.283
Okay. Just need to fuel up first.

17:55.409 --> 17:57.744
You're meant to do that
before pickup, 963.

17:58.787 --> 18:00.539
Copy that, boss. Doing the best I can.

18:00.622 --> 18:03.125
I will be in as soon as I fuel up, okay?

18:05.502 --> 18:06.420
963 out.

18:06.503 --> 18:08.755
Yeah, Ma. Did you take his temperature?

18:08.839 --> 18:10.757
I'm looking for the thermometer.

18:10.841 --> 18:13.093
It should be in the first aid kit.

18:13.177 --> 18:14.261
It's not there.

18:15.304 --> 18:17.723
How about under the kitchen sink?
Try there, Ma.

18:17.806 --> 18:19.433
I've gotta pull in to fuel up.

18:19.516 --> 18:22.269
- I'll call you right back, okay?
-Okay.

18:24.104 --> 18:26.106
Come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

18:27.608 --> 18:28.650
Come on.

18:37.951 --> 18:39.995
All right, I got it.

18:40.704 --> 18:43.457
- Oroville, Engine 2161.
- Oroville.

18:43.540 --> 18:44.666
I got a visual.

18:44.750 --> 18:46.877
Blowing southwest under the power lines.

18:46.960 --> 18:48.378
Gotta be about 100 acres.

18:49.463 --> 18:51.882
Hey, I don't know about this.
We don't have an escape route.

18:52.716 --> 18:54.468
We're close. Let's stick with it.

18:57.137 --> 18:59.264
Look at it, cap.
There's no way we're getting up there.

19:01.016 --> 19:02.100
We gotta turn around.

19:02.643 --> 19:04.394
Let's find an alternative strike point.

19:05.521 --> 19:06.688
This route's no good.

19:07.481 --> 19:08.565
Cap, come on.

19:09.107 --> 19:10.317
Okay.

19:11.068 --> 19:12.069
Okay.

19:13.570 --> 19:15.489
Oroville, Engine 2161.

19:15.572 --> 19:17.074
2161, Oroville. Copy.

19:17.157 --> 19:18.909
We can't reach it down here.
It's too dangerous.

19:18.992 --> 19:22.246
We're gonna head back up the ridge
and see if we can find a new strike point.

19:22.329 --> 19:25.874
Copy that. ICP is being
established at Scooter's on Highway 70.

19:25.958 --> 19:27.125
Resources are out.

19:29.628 --> 19:30.921
Come on.

19:33.924 --> 19:34.842
Let's go!

19:53.902 --> 19:55.320
For Division 2102,

19:55.404 --> 19:58.824
Engine 2186, Engine 2182, Engine 2162,

19:58.907 --> 20:03.662
Transport 2140, Transport 2142.
Butte crew 1, Butte crew 2, Butte crew 3,

20:03.745 --> 20:06.623
vegetation fire reported
in the area of Camp Creek Road.

20:06.707 --> 20:09.209
Respond to staging
at Scooter's on Highway 70.

20:10.043 --> 20:11.128
Yes, keep it coming.

20:17.593 --> 20:19.344
- Okay, what have we got?
- Okay.

20:19.428 --> 20:22.514
Fire started about right here, all right?

20:23.557 --> 20:27.895
We think it's about two to three hundred
acres, so it's sitting about like that.

20:28.437 --> 20:31.607
A really strong east wind
pushed it down canyon.

20:31.690 --> 20:34.693
The Jarbo Gap engines tried to make
access across Camp Creek Road.

20:34.776 --> 20:36.862
They couldn't do it.
Just got too narrow, too steep.

20:36.945 --> 20:37.946
They backed out.

20:38.030 --> 20:39.865
They are now coming up over the ridge,

20:39.948 --> 20:41.992
and they're trying to make access
down from the top.

20:42.075 --> 20:43.493
Have any other engines deployed?

20:43.577 --> 20:47.206
Yeah. We got five
additional strike teams en route.

20:47.289 --> 20:49.499
Copy that. Any communities threatened?

20:49.583 --> 20:51.460
Yeah. We got Pulga a mile west.

20:51.543 --> 20:53.712
This is an old gold rush post.
It's uninhabited.

20:53.795 --> 20:55.005
And then we got Concow.

20:55.088 --> 20:58.675
Okay, so this is a good couple miles away.
It's well clear of the fire.

20:58.759 --> 21:01.803
Trailers and cabins mostly.
Eight hundred people.

21:01.887 --> 21:04.306
Retirees, pot smokers,
homesteaders, that kind of thing.

21:04.389 --> 21:06.391
Let's issue an evac warning just in case.

21:06.475 --> 21:08.310
- Okay.
- What about Paradise?

21:08.393 --> 21:11.104
Chief, it's eight miles
away on the other side of the canyon.

21:11.188 --> 21:13.023
Population's about 27,000.

21:13.106 --> 21:15.234
I don't think it's an issue.
They should be fine.

21:18.237 --> 21:19.821
- Yeah.
- Uh…

21:19.905 --> 21:21.323
- Huh?
- One.

21:21.406 --> 21:23.075
-One what?
-Eleven.

21:23.158 --> 21:26.537
No. Look, it can't be 111.
No, that's impossible.

21:26.620 --> 21:27.955
If it was 111, he'd be dead.

21:28.038 --> 21:28.872
- Pump 1.
- Pump number?

21:28.956 --> 21:30.999
I can't read these numbers.
They're so tiny.

21:31.083 --> 21:32.334
Have Shaun read it for you.

21:32.417 --> 21:35.045
- He's…
- Shaun, are you there?

21:35.128 --> 21:37.214
- …101.
- Shaun, get on the phone, will ya?

21:37.297 --> 21:41.009
So, he's got a temperature.
He doesn't want to talk, Kevin.

21:41.635 --> 21:43.554
He says he'll speak to you later.

21:43.637 --> 21:46.974
- He probably just needs his mom.
- I'm sure he does need his mom, huh?

21:47.057 --> 21:50.394
He's sick, but he's here with his dad.

21:51.228 --> 21:52.980
He's got me, and he's got you.

21:54.064 --> 21:57.734
Listen, Ma, I can't talk right now.
I gotta get the bus to the depot.

21:58.277 --> 22:00.863
I'll swing by the drugstore,
get Shaun some medicine.

22:00.946 --> 22:03.031
I'll be home as soon as I can
after work, okay?

22:06.827 --> 22:07.911
Camp IC, Oroville.

22:07.995 --> 22:10.998
We're getting unconfirmed reports
of another fire in that area.

22:11.498 --> 22:13.417
Oroville, Camp IC. Go ahead.
What's its location?

22:13.500 --> 22:15.043
Camp IC, Oroville. We're unsure.

22:15.127 --> 22:17.713
There's a lot of smoke in the area,
and we have a couple cameras down,

22:17.796 --> 22:20.674
but I believe it to be off Rim Road,
north of Concow.

22:21.258 --> 22:22.718
Oroville, Camp IC copies.

22:23.427 --> 22:25.846
What do you think?
That's a second start or a spot?

22:25.929 --> 22:27.181
We're three miles away.

22:27.264 --> 22:29.224
I don't know how the heck
that would be a spot fire.

22:29.308 --> 22:31.185
That's a long ways
from the-the original fire.

22:31.268 --> 22:32.269
Okay.

22:32.352 --> 22:34.730
- I think we've got two fires.
- Camp IC, we received a call

22:34.813 --> 22:36.648
from PG&E. They advised of a power outage

22:36.732 --> 22:39.109
approximately ten minutes ago
in the Rim Road area of Concow.

22:39.193 --> 22:40.485
- I believe this…
- So it was a power line then.

22:40.569 --> 22:43.906
…is gonna be related to your second start.
There are power lines down in that area.

22:43.989 --> 22:46.575
The PG&E linemen are here.
Do you want them to wait?

22:47.367 --> 22:49.036
- No. I wanna talk to them.
- Okay.

22:50.537 --> 22:53.373
The hell are you guys doing?
I got two fires now.

22:54.041 --> 22:56.210
I need all your lines
in the area shut down,

22:56.752 --> 22:59.087
right away, before I get any more fires.

22:59.171 --> 23:02.007
We had Red Flag Warnings last night.
You guys knew about this.

23:02.090 --> 23:03.759
Why didn't you shut it down then?

23:03.842 --> 23:07.137
Look, we'll get our people down
to the substation to shut it down.

23:07.221 --> 23:10.557
We'll get up to the transmission tower
to secure the downed lines.

23:10.641 --> 23:12.017
I got two fires now.

23:12.935 --> 23:17.022
It's on your headquarters. It wasn't your
fault, but let's get this taken care of.

23:17.105 --> 23:18.690
Messina.

23:19.525 --> 23:21.652
Send five additional strike teams
to this new start.

23:21.735 --> 23:23.237
Chief,
are you copying this priority traffic?

23:23.320 --> 23:26.532
Camp IC, Utility 2136. Priority traffic.

23:27.115 --> 23:29.576
Utility 2136, Camp IC. Go ahead.

23:29.660 --> 23:32.204
This is Engineer Hopkins on Utility 2136.

23:32.287 --> 23:34.039
I'm going off duty out in Concow.

23:34.581 --> 23:37.125
We've got a serious situation developing,
be advised.

23:37.751 --> 23:39.837
Heavy smoke
and embers blowing in out here.

23:40.379 --> 23:42.381
- Are you sure about that? In Concow?
- Concow?

23:42.464 --> 23:44.967
That's affirmative.
I'm driving through it now.

23:45.801 --> 23:47.553
We've got embers
falling around structures.

23:47.636 --> 23:48.929
It's jumped the fucking box.

23:51.056 --> 23:53.058
Correction. We've got a spot fire.

23:59.439 --> 24:01.316
Correction. Multiple spots.

24:01.400 --> 24:03.610
I count one, two, three, big ones.

24:03.694 --> 24:05.070
Rapid rate of spread.

24:05.821 --> 24:07.573
I'm losing visibility fast.

24:07.656 --> 24:09.992
That's a hell of a distance for a spread.

24:10.075 --> 24:11.326
Gotta be at least five miles.

24:11.410 --> 24:13.161
You think it's another set of power lines?

24:13.245 --> 24:15.914
No. I guarantee
the power's already off up in Concow.

24:15.998 --> 24:18.250
I mean, that's a lot of distance covered.

24:26.091 --> 24:27.092
Messina.

24:28.051 --> 24:30.053
Listen to me. It's one fire.

24:30.804 --> 24:32.431
- No. That--
- It's one fire.

24:32.514 --> 24:34.600
No, that would be impossible
for it to move that way.

24:34.683 --> 24:37.352
- All one damn fire.
- If we got one fire,

24:38.061 --> 24:40.022
you're looking at
a perimeter about… like that.

24:40.105 --> 24:41.940
Okay. Let's send resources to Concow.

24:42.441 --> 24:44.568
Air tankers, engines.
Give him what he needs.

24:44.651 --> 24:46.737
- Tankers. Yeah.
- Copy. You got that?

24:46.820 --> 24:48.614
Okay. So, if we've got fire in Concow,

24:48.697 --> 24:51.325
we have to change
that evac warning to an order.

24:51.408 --> 24:52.409
- Do it.
- Copy.

24:52.951 --> 24:54.828
New containment line is Jordan Hill Road.

24:56.246 --> 24:58.373
All drivers, this is Base. Listen up.

24:58.457 --> 25:00.417
Well, I guess today's a real special day

25:00.501 --> 25:04.129
because we just saw
that Cal Fire's got a fire up by Concow.

25:04.713 --> 25:06.048
So, y'all know the drill.

25:06.131 --> 25:09.051
Just stay off the radio,
and be listening for code reds, okay?

25:10.385 --> 25:13.222
963, Base call. You on your way?

25:13.305 --> 25:16.433
Base, this is 963. ETA 15 minutes, boss.

25:16.517 --> 25:18.685
I've got one more quick stop I gotta make.

25:18.769 --> 25:21.188
Kevin, you need
to get bus 963 into the garage,

25:21.271 --> 25:22.814
or you're gonna miss your afternoon route.

25:22.898 --> 25:24.942
I told you,
it's gonna take at least two hours.

25:26.318 --> 25:29.071
Understood, boss. I've got
a bit of a family situation, okay?

25:29.655 --> 25:31.406
Kevin, I'm not interested, okay?

25:31.490 --> 25:34.826
I need you to get the bus back here now.
The mechanic can't wait around all day.

25:35.702 --> 25:38.330
Copy that, boss.
I'll be there as soon as I can. Over.

25:49.341 --> 25:51.426
- Everyone, evacuate! Let's go!
- Help!

25:52.344 --> 25:54.429
Go get in that truck, okay?

25:55.013 --> 25:56.265
Everyone, evacuate!

25:56.765 --> 25:57.766
Let's go!

25:58.267 --> 26:00.769
Leave everything.
Leave that. Leave everything.

26:00.853 --> 26:02.020
Get in the car now!

26:02.104 --> 26:03.981
- Hey, is there anyone else inside?
- No.

26:04.606 --> 26:05.941
Anyone inside?

26:06.024 --> 26:07.359
Come on, baby. Let's go.

26:08.360 --> 26:09.945
Fire department!

26:13.198 --> 26:14.533
Guys, let's go.

26:14.616 --> 26:15.659
Leave your bags.

26:16.451 --> 26:17.452
Leave your bags!

26:17.995 --> 26:19.830
Everyone, evacuate!

26:25.544 --> 26:27.087
- Mommy!
- Leave it.

26:27.171 --> 26:28.505
- We gotta go. Come on!
- No!

26:28.589 --> 26:31.008
I said get her in the car now. Let's go.

26:32.634 --> 26:34.136
- Do you have a car?
- No.

26:34.219 --> 26:37.306
Go get in that white truck.
Hurry up. Let's go. Hold on tight.

26:37.389 --> 26:38.390
Go!

26:43.312 --> 26:45.105
IC, Utility 2136.

26:45.606 --> 26:48.442
Be advised,
we need medics for multiple burn injuries.

26:49.026 --> 26:50.360
I'm starting a convoy.

26:50.444 --> 26:52.196
We're heading out on Concow Road.

26:52.279 --> 26:54.656
Follow me! Stay close!

26:54.740 --> 26:56.450
Everyone, follow each other!

26:56.533 --> 26:58.702
Everyone, hang on, okay?

26:58.785 --> 27:00.037
Let's go.

27:19.681 --> 27:21.183
- Hello?
- Do you have any questions

27:21.266 --> 27:22.267
- about--
- Hello?

27:22.351 --> 27:23.769
I'll be with you in a moment.

27:23.852 --> 27:24.853
Okay.

27:26.188 --> 27:27.898
Sounds good. And they are chewable.

27:28.565 --> 27:29.566
You can eat that.

27:29.650 --> 27:31.360
That I don't think is a good idea.

27:31.443 --> 27:32.444
Okay.

27:32.528 --> 27:35.572
Ma'am, my son…
He's got a fever, and he's throwing up.

27:35.656 --> 27:36.573
I was on the phone.

27:36.657 --> 27:37.908
- Your son, how old is he?
- Sure.

27:37.991 --> 27:38.992
Fourteen.

27:39.076 --> 27:41.203
- Does he have any allergies?
- He's 15, actually.

27:41.286 --> 27:42.579
Yeah. He's 15. No…

27:43.163 --> 27:45.791
- I don't know.
- Food intolerances or anything like that?

27:45.874 --> 27:47.417
I don't think so. No.

27:47.501 --> 27:50.712
Whatever the standard thing is
for fever and throwing up.

27:50.796 --> 27:51.630
Okay. Sounds like

27:51.713 --> 27:53.215
- Tylenol would be your best bet.
- Yeah.

27:53.298 --> 27:54.132
Great. Thank you.

27:54.216 --> 27:56.385
Great. These are going for $7.25.

27:56.468 --> 27:58.387
Okay. All right.

27:58.470 --> 28:00.305
- I'll be right there, Linda.
- Would you like a bag?

28:00.389 --> 28:02.015
No. That's good. You can keep the change.

28:02.099 --> 28:02.933
Sir, I can…

28:03.016 --> 28:05.853
- Yeah. Go ahead. Huh? No.
- What's going on, Kevin?

28:05.936 --> 28:07.813
Shaun's been messaging.
Says he wants to come home.

28:07.896 --> 28:09.606
- No.
- He says he wants me to come get him.

28:09.690 --> 28:11.859
- No. That's ridiculous.
- Well, he sounds upset.

28:11.942 --> 28:13.026
- What happened?
- Nothing.

28:13.110 --> 28:15.654
We had a little misunderstanding.
I thought he was cutting class.

28:15.737 --> 28:17.322
- Well, was he?
- Was he what?

28:17.406 --> 28:18.991
- Was he cutting class?
- No.

28:19.700 --> 28:22.077
It was my mistake.
He's actually got a stomach flu.

28:22.160 --> 28:24.288
But look, I just picked up some Tylenol,
so everything's fine.

28:24.371 --> 28:27.791
It's not fine, Kevin. Not if he's ill
and saying he wants to come home.

28:27.875 --> 28:29.626
I don't have time
for this right now, Linda.

28:29.710 --> 28:32.462
You hear me? I'm already late to get
the bus to the depot for maintenance.

28:32.546 --> 28:35.340
And you think I got time?
I'm working too, you know?

28:35.424 --> 28:38.010
And Pete and I are supposed
to be going to Colorado tonight.

28:39.178 --> 28:41.346
- Tonight?
- Yes, tonight.

28:42.055 --> 28:43.056
I told you.

28:44.850 --> 28:47.519
My bad. Listen, Linda,
I'm gonna have to call you back.

28:51.190 --> 28:52.441
963 to Base.

28:53.066 --> 28:55.736
Okay, 963. Base call.
You on your way, Kevin?

28:55.819 --> 28:57.404
Are there any updates on that fire?

28:57.487 --> 29:00.157
Because I'm up here in Magalia,
and I can see the smoke column

29:00.240 --> 29:01.992
over the canyon, okay?

29:02.075 --> 29:05.412
- And it's blowing right at us.
- Kevin, there are no updates.

29:05.495 --> 29:06.914
Cal Fire's all over it, okay?

29:06.997 --> 29:09.750
Now, get that bus back here now.
I've already asked you three times.

29:09.833 --> 29:12.503
Now, get back here
or you can look for another job.

29:12.586 --> 29:13.587
Base clear.

29:14.505 --> 29:16.006
Copy that, boss. On my way in.

29:18.342 --> 29:19.843
Camp IC, Camp Air Attack.

29:19.927 --> 29:21.261
Tankers inbound.

29:21.845 --> 29:23.096
ETA four minutes.

29:24.806 --> 29:26.391
Copy. Engines responding.

29:26.475 --> 29:29.895
En route to Concow reservoir,
heading southbound on Jordan Hill Road.

29:30.521 --> 29:31.522
Copy.

29:31.605 --> 29:32.898
What's the ETA on those engines?

29:32.981 --> 29:35.192
The Paradise engines are 18 minutes out.

29:35.275 --> 29:38.153
Copy that.
Utility 2136, Air Attack is inbound.

29:38.237 --> 29:39.488
18 minutes on those engines.

29:39.571 --> 29:42.491
Negative! That's too long.
We're gonna get burned over here.

29:44.117 --> 29:45.327
Jesus!

29:49.706 --> 29:50.832
Just hang on, guys.

29:57.005 --> 30:00.133
Camp Air Attack. Air tankers
inbound, retardant drop at the head.

30:06.181 --> 30:07.432
Camp IC, Camp Air Attack.

30:08.016 --> 30:10.769
We're having problems hitting the targets
with these winds.

30:10.853 --> 30:13.856
Air Attack, Camp IC.
I need you to try a second pass.

30:13.939 --> 30:16.733
Chief, the Paradise engines
are 15 minutes out from Concow.

30:16.817 --> 30:18.735
Okay. Oroville, Camp IC.

30:19.361 --> 30:20.988
Camp IC, Oroville. Go ahead.

30:21.071 --> 30:25.701
Oroville, Camp IC requesting
ten air tankers, six Type 1 helicopters,

30:26.243 --> 30:29.913

30:29.997 --> 30:31.582
Camp IC, Oroville copies.

30:31.665 --> 30:33.166
All county aircraft, ten tankers,

30:33.250 --> 30:36.336
six Type 1 copters,
25 additional engines immediately.

30:37.963 --> 30:40.966
Oroville, I copy.
Moving resources to Concow now.

30:43.677 --> 30:47.055
Utility 2136,
can you get onto Camelot Road?

30:47.139 --> 30:49.766
Negative.
The fire's blocked it. I'm cut off.

30:50.392 --> 30:52.227
This thing is going to burn over them.

30:52.311 --> 30:53.896
- Get 'em to the bridge.
- Hoffman Bridge?

30:53.979 --> 30:55.981
- Get 'em to Hoffman Bridge.
- That's the best place.

30:56.064 --> 31:00.527
Utility 2136, can you reach Hoffman Bridge
and shelter in the water?

31:00.611 --> 31:02.362
Camp IC, I'll try.

31:02.446 --> 31:04.156
All right, listen up!

31:04.239 --> 31:06.158
As soon as I stop the truck,
you're gonna get out,

31:06.241 --> 31:07.868
you're gonna run into the creek!

31:07.951 --> 31:10.746
As soon as you get in the creek,
cover your mouth, protect your airway.

31:10.829 --> 31:12.915
Feet to the fire, okay?
Everyone understand?

31:15.375 --> 31:16.668
All right, let's go!

31:26.553 --> 31:29.097
Go! Get in the water now!

31:29.973 --> 31:31.975
Into the water! Let's go!

31:32.684 --> 31:34.728
Hang on! Into the water!

31:35.312 --> 31:36.855
Utility 2136,

31:37.564 --> 31:39.650
multiple residents taking shelter
in the creek!

31:46.698 --> 31:48.158
Oh, my God!

31:50.994 --> 31:52.162
Goddamn it!

31:57.125 --> 31:58.961
Get as far out as you can!

31:59.795 --> 32:00.796
Come on!

32:01.338 --> 32:03.423
Utility 2136…

32:05.300 --> 32:06.510
burnover imminent!

32:06.593 --> 32:08.303
What's the status on our support?

32:08.387 --> 32:12.266
Utility 2136, copy that.
Air Attack are making their second pass.

32:12.349 --> 32:13.976
Engines are ten minutes out.

32:14.059 --> 32:15.727
Camp IC, Camp Air Attack.

32:15.811 --> 32:17.187
Air tankers inbound now.

32:17.271 --> 32:19.481
Air Attack, Camp IC copies.

32:21.066 --> 32:22.776
Come on!

32:25.320 --> 32:26.196
Keep calm!

32:27.573 --> 32:29.950
Camp IC, Engine 2182.

32:30.033 --> 32:32.703
We've got multiple obstacles
in the roadway. We can't get through.

32:32.786 --> 32:34.121
The road is blocked.

32:34.204 --> 32:36.582
Repeating, access is completely blocked.

32:38.333 --> 32:41.170
Air Attack, Camp IC,
give me an update on that drop.

32:42.337 --> 32:43.797
Camp IC, Camp Air Attack.

32:43.881 --> 32:46.675
No impact with the drop. No impact at all.

32:46.758 --> 32:48.343
Damn it, where are those Paradise engines?

32:48.427 --> 32:50.596
I just got word
they're not gonna make it through.

32:50.679 --> 32:52.431
They're stuck. They're not gonna make it.

32:52.514 --> 32:54.224
Stay together! It's coming!

32:54.308 --> 32:56.810
Stay calm! We'll make it through!

33:01.773 --> 33:03.066
Heads down!

33:03.150 --> 33:05.611
Burnover! Burnover! Burnover!

33:15.287 --> 33:18.040
Utility 2136, what's your status?

33:21.960 --> 33:23.962
Utility 2136, do you copy?

33:24.046 --> 33:26.465
- Answer the radio.
- Come on.

33:27.090 --> 33:30.427
Utility 2136, do you copy?

33:31.011 --> 33:32.179
It's not good.

33:35.891 --> 33:37.809
Initial wave has passed.

33:38.310 --> 33:39.937
We're sheltering in the creek.

33:41.688 --> 33:45.526
We got multiple burn injuries,
and we need help now!

33:45.609 --> 33:48.946
Utility 2136, copy that.
Hold your position.

33:49.029 --> 33:52.449
We'll get medics in
and dozers inbound to clear an evac path.

33:53.116 --> 33:56.286
You don't understand!
Extreme fire behavior.

33:56.370 --> 33:59.122
Critical rate of spread,
heading west towards Paradise!

34:44.126 --> 34:45.377
Shaun.

34:45.460 --> 34:47.295
Hey, it's me, Dad. Listen…

34:50.215 --> 34:51.466
I'm sorry about last night.

34:51.550 --> 34:54.636
All right.
I'm sorry you're not feeling well.

34:54.719 --> 34:56.221
I just picked up some medicine.

34:56.304 --> 34:59.308
I'll get it to you as soon
as I get home after work. All right?

34:59.892 --> 35:01.935
Listen, I need you to do me a favor.

35:02.019 --> 35:04.146
All right, the… fire out in Concow,

35:04.229 --> 35:06.815
I don't think
it's anything to worry about.

35:07.816 --> 35:10.819
But just in case, turn on Channel 7
so you can keep an eye on it.

35:10.903 --> 35:13.363
Okay? I don't want Grandma to worry.

35:13.447 --> 35:15.532
You know how she gets worried.

35:16.700 --> 35:17.701
All right, buddy.

35:18.994 --> 35:20.829
I'll see you after work.

35:20.913 --> 35:22.164
Hope you're feeling better.

35:26.001 --> 35:28.670
Oroville, Camp IC.
We gotta get people moving.

35:28.754 --> 35:30.088
Alert Town Hall.

35:30.172 --> 35:35.344
Issue mandatory evacuation warning
for zones 3, 8, 14. East Paradise,

35:35.427 --> 35:37.179
anything east of Pentz Road.

35:37.262 --> 35:39.014
Estimate about 4,000 residents.

35:39.097 --> 35:40.933
Camp IC, Oroville copies.

35:41.016 --> 35:43.519
- Mandatory evacuation zones 3, 8, 14.
- We stay focused.

35:43.602 --> 35:45.229
We have a plan. We stick to it.

36:10.045 --> 36:12.464
Okay. Yes, I've got it. All right.

36:13.549 --> 36:15.551
They've issued an evacuation order.

36:15.634 --> 36:16.969
Phone lines are down.

36:17.052 --> 36:18.220
Come on.

36:18.887 --> 36:20.305
All right, give me those zones.

36:20.889 --> 36:22.850
3, 8 and 14.

36:22.933 --> 36:24.393
East Paradise only.

36:26.478 --> 36:28.689
It won't go through. It didn't send.

36:29.439 --> 36:30.440
Okay.

36:32.025 --> 36:33.026
Go!

36:36.572 --> 36:40.158
Camp Air Attack, Camp IC,
I need air support in the canyon now.

36:40.242 --> 36:41.785
We need you to buy us some time.

36:42.286 --> 36:44.746
Chief, look at that fire
coming down towards Paradise.

36:46.373 --> 36:48.041
Camp IC, Camp Air Attack.

36:48.125 --> 36:49.626
We are having zero impact.

36:49.710 --> 36:52.087
The fire is spotting onto
the western side of the canyon.

36:52.171 --> 36:54.006
Wind speed is a real problem.

36:57.259 --> 36:59.511
IC copies. We need outside resources.

36:59.595 --> 37:02.347
Requesting 50 additional
strike teams immediately.

37:02.431 --> 37:03.724
Camp IC, Oroville copies.

37:03.807 --> 37:06.643
That's gonna be extended,
sir, minimum two to three hours.

37:06.727 --> 37:09.479
Chief, if we don't get resources
into Paradise now,

37:09.563 --> 37:10.564
we're gonna lose this thing.

37:10.647 --> 37:12.149
It's gonna be too late.

37:12.232 --> 37:13.817
We're gonna lose our air support.

37:13.901 --> 37:15.903
It's too dangerous
to fly in these conditions.

37:15.986 --> 37:18.363
There's no way they're gonna continue
in this wind.

37:20.324 --> 37:22.868
Camp IC, Branch 3.
We're being overrun.

37:23.535 --> 37:26.038
The fire is crossing the canyon.
We can't stop it.

37:26.121 --> 37:28.123
Do you copy? We can't stop it.

37:39.259 --> 37:41.428
Okay. Mary's class, sit down.

37:43.931 --> 37:44.932
Class,

37:45.432 --> 37:47.976
we don't all need to look out the window.

37:48.060 --> 37:51.146
It's just another brush fire.
Nothing new. Come sit down.

37:51.772 --> 37:52.856
Take out a book.

38:00.239 --> 38:02.783
- Do we know what we're doing?
- Still no evacuation order.

38:02.866 --> 38:04.034
I'm not waiting.

38:04.117 --> 38:07.913
Okay, let's just get everyone out of here
and home as quickly as we can.

38:07.996 --> 38:09.748
Okay, I'll send an email to parents.

38:09.831 --> 38:13.585
If any of your students have phones
or know their numbers,

38:13.669 --> 38:15.504
- get the parents to collect.
- Okay, but…

38:15.587 --> 38:18.006
but some of my kids
have parents who work out of town,

38:18.090 --> 38:21.093
and the parents will never get here
in time. What do we do about those kids?

38:21.176 --> 38:24.137
Okay. I'm sure they're gonna
have an alternative collection point.

38:24.221 --> 38:27.057
So, let's just gather together
the students who can't be collected.

38:27.140 --> 38:28.934
And I'll just keep trying Town Hall.

38:29.017 --> 38:30.394
Okay. Thank you.

38:30.477 --> 38:31.562
Okay…

38:32.187 --> 38:35.065
Echo. Do you know your mom's phone number?

38:35.148 --> 38:36.358
- Uh-huh.
- You do?

38:36.900 --> 38:38.652
- Great. F--
- 435-232--

38:38.735 --> 38:41.488
Okay. Hold on one second.
I'm gonna ask you to write it down.

38:42.114 --> 38:44.324
Who else knows their mom
or dad's phone number?

38:46.326 --> 38:48.495
- Yeah?
- You said you'd call me back.

38:48.579 --> 38:49.746
I'm sorry. I got distracted.

38:49.830 --> 38:51.999
Look, I don't want to argue.

38:52.082 --> 38:54.418
I'm tired of the same fight every week.

38:54.501 --> 38:56.712
We don't need to argue, Lin.
There's nothing to argue about.

38:56.795 --> 38:59.214
Okay. I didn't realize our son was sick.

38:59.298 --> 39:02.259
It was an honest mistake.
You don't need to get involved.

39:02.342 --> 39:04.553
Then why is he calling me?

39:04.636 --> 39:06.805
I don't know! Linda, he's 15!

39:06.889 --> 39:09.141
He got in a fight with his dad,
and he's calling his mom.

39:09.224 --> 39:12.269
Don't make this a bigger deal than it is.
I'm dealing with it.

39:12.352 --> 39:15.522
Base to 963, what is your location?

39:17.149 --> 39:18.984
963, ETA, ten minutes.

39:19.067 --> 39:20.736
The traffic is backed up over here.

39:20.819 --> 39:24.573
Face it, Kevin. You're just… unreliable.

39:24.656 --> 39:26.992
No, I'm not doing this right now, Lin.

39:27.075 --> 39:30.370
I'm not gonna sit here and go over
all the ways that I screwed up with you.

39:32.623 --> 39:33.957
Listen, it's been tough…

39:35.209 --> 39:36.293
lately with Dad dying.

39:37.002 --> 39:39.129
Don't use your dad as an excuse.

39:39.213 --> 39:42.591
The funeral was four months ago,
and you barely spoke to him for 20 years.

39:42.674 --> 39:44.009
He ruined your life.

39:44.092 --> 39:45.427
That's what you told me!

39:45.511 --> 39:46.845
That's bullshit, Linda.

39:48.639 --> 39:50.224
That's bullshit. That's a low blow.

39:53.727 --> 39:54.895
I'm sorry.

39:56.063 --> 39:57.147
That wasn't nice.

39:58.148 --> 40:01.235
It's just the first weekend
I've been away with anyone since we…

40:03.070 --> 40:04.154
You know what I mean.

40:08.909 --> 40:11.578
Can you turn the radio down?
I can barely hear you.

40:12.204 --> 40:13.372
Turning it down.

40:15.207 --> 40:18.335
All I'm saying is
I know it's been hard for you,

40:18.418 --> 40:20.254
but you gotta think about Shaun.

40:21.129 --> 40:23.882
He looks at you, and all he sees is…

40:23.966 --> 40:25.050
What?

40:26.677 --> 40:28.512
What does he see when he looks at me?

40:28.595 --> 40:31.390
- Don't make me say it, Kevin.
- No, go ahead, say it.

40:31.473 --> 40:33.308
- You know what I mean.
- Say it.

40:37.187 --> 40:39.648
There's a reason why your life is a mess,

40:40.607 --> 40:43.443
and Shaun doesn't want to be with you.

40:47.281 --> 40:48.365
I gotta go.

41:07.551 --> 41:08.844
Base to all drivers.

41:09.469 --> 41:11.805
We're having issues
with the comms over here.

41:11.889 --> 41:13.056
Is everybody hearing me?

41:17.227 --> 41:19.188
Hey, Shaun. Hey, it's Dad.

41:19.271 --> 41:20.272
Listen…

41:21.773 --> 41:23.859
I need to know you're okay, buddy. I…

41:24.776 --> 41:27.154
Call me back if you're getting
any of these messages, please.

41:27.237 --> 41:29.239
Okay? I gotta…

41:30.490 --> 41:32.326
I gotta run the bus to the depot.

41:32.826 --> 41:35.204
Swinging by maintenance
for a couple of hours, then I'll…

41:41.335 --> 41:42.544
You know what?

41:42.628 --> 41:44.630
I'm coming home right now.

41:45.297 --> 41:47.007
You hear me, buddy?

41:47.090 --> 41:48.467
I'm coming home right now.

41:52.679 --> 41:55.516
I got your medicine on me.
I'll be there in 20 minutes max.

42:08.028 --> 42:09.863
Hey, all drivers, this is Base.

42:09.947 --> 42:11.198
This is an important update.

42:11.281 --> 42:14.910
We are now evacuating East Paradise only.

42:14.993 --> 42:20.165
- What zones?
- East Paradise zones 3, 8 and 14.

42:20.249 --> 42:23.919
That is 3, 8 and 14 only.

42:24.002 --> 42:27.339
Any driver east of Clark
all the way to Pentz,

42:27.422 --> 42:29.424
you need to evacuate
that area immediately.

42:29.508 --> 42:33.136
They're worried about the fire coming
across the canyon from Concow.

42:33.220 --> 42:35.138
So if you have any children on board,

42:35.222 --> 42:40.060
you need to take them west all the way
out of town to the Chico depot.

42:40.143 --> 42:43.730
Repeat, the evacuation muster point
is Chico depot.

42:43.814 --> 42:44.982
Base clear.

42:48.026 --> 42:49.778
Okay, honey. Get in.

42:51.238 --> 42:52.948
Come on. Stop!

42:59.288 --> 43:00.747
All right, let's…

43:01.790 --> 43:03.000
I'll be right back.

43:03.083 --> 43:05.335
All right, so we got the evac order.

43:05.419 --> 43:08.338
Apparently, their system went down,
and they weren't able to get it out.

43:08.422 --> 43:10.883
They want every student
who hasn't already been collected

43:10.966 --> 43:13.385
to be taken over to Paradise Elementary.

43:13.468 --> 43:15.053
Okay? That's the new collection point.

43:15.137 --> 43:16.638
That's where they're sending
all the parents.

43:16.722 --> 43:19.266
Okay. Well,
we have 23 kids without transport.

43:19.349 --> 43:21.185
So how are we gonna get them there?

43:21.268 --> 43:22.853
I can take four in my car.

43:24.229 --> 43:26.440
- I didn't drive, so I can't help at all.
- No.

43:26.523 --> 43:28.775
We cannot get them there by ourselves.

43:28.859 --> 43:30.360
We don't have enough cars.

43:30.444 --> 43:31.820
- Yes.
- They need to send us a bus.

43:31.904 --> 43:33.906
- Call Ruby.
- Oh, yeah. I'll call the depot.

43:39.369 --> 43:41.705
Hi, Anna. It's Mary.

43:41.788 --> 43:45.501
Look, they're evacuating East Paradise,
and I can't get to Jake.

43:45.584 --> 43:46.919
Steven's out of town for work.

43:47.002 --> 43:49.004
And I was wondering
if you could go get him,

43:49.087 --> 43:51.298
and then I'll just get
to you as soon as I can.

43:51.381 --> 43:52.799
Okay. Thank you.

43:52.883 --> 43:55.469
Let me know that you got this.
All right? Love you. Bye.

43:56.386 --> 43:58.388
Unified Schools Transportation Office.

44:00.724 --> 44:03.727
I'm sorry. Can you speak up please?

44:04.436 --> 44:06.063
It's the principal of Ponderosa.

44:06.855 --> 44:08.273
Yes, ma'am.

44:08.857 --> 44:10.234
Yes, ma'am.

44:11.151 --> 44:12.819
They need a bus to take them west

44:12.903 --> 44:15.447
to the alternative collection
point at Paradise Elementary.

44:15.531 --> 44:17.449
Just outside the evac zone.

44:17.533 --> 44:20.369
Do we have anybody on a route over there?
Check the route maps.

44:20.452 --> 44:21.745
- Cesar.
- Yeah?

44:21.828 --> 44:23.580
I need you to go out
and prep a bus just in case.

44:23.664 --> 44:25.082
- All right.
- Yes, ma'am.

44:25.165 --> 44:27.376
We are gonna get a bus
right out to you, okay?

44:27.459 --> 44:29.044
So you just sit tight. Okay?

44:29.670 --> 44:30.754
Thank you so much.

44:30.838 --> 44:32.172
All right. Bye-bye.

44:32.256 --> 44:36.844
Base to all drivers,
this is an update on that evac notice.

44:36.927 --> 44:38.011
We have a situation.

44:38.095 --> 44:40.097
Ponderosa Elementary.

44:40.180 --> 44:44.560
I repeat, there's a situation developing
at Ponderosa Elementary.

44:44.643 --> 44:48.814
There are 23 kids who are stranded
in the evacuation zone.

44:48.897 --> 44:51.149
Their parents cannot make it
in to pick them up.

44:51.233 --> 44:52.901
They need to be picked up

44:52.985 --> 44:57.364
and taken to the alternative
collection point at Paradise Elementary.

44:57.447 --> 45:01.410
Is there anybody empty
and in the area of East Paradise?

45:02.452 --> 45:05.122
987 to Base. Sorry, all full.

45:05.205 --> 45:06.874
Not reached my school yet.

45:06.957 --> 45:09.960
910 to Base. Full here too, Ruby.

45:10.043 --> 45:11.295
Ten minutes from dropping off.

45:11.378 --> 45:12.629
Come on.

45:12.713 --> 45:15.299
922 to Base, I'm en route to Chico.

45:15.382 --> 45:18.594
I'm just passing Base,
but I can swing back.

45:18.677 --> 45:20.262
No, 922. Do not swing back.

45:20.345 --> 45:21.930
Once you get out of there, you get out.

45:22.014 --> 45:24.349
Those roads are gonna get
real crazy real quick, okay?

45:24.433 --> 45:27.936
Is there anybody in East Paradise
with an empty bus

45:28.020 --> 45:29.855
that can go and pick these kids up?

45:34.985 --> 45:36.820
No.

45:49.666 --> 45:51.293
963 to Base, I can get 'em.

45:55.464 --> 45:56.632
Kevin, is that you?

45:56.715 --> 45:57.716
Yeah.

45:58.467 --> 46:00.469
Yeah, I'm still on this side of town.
Remember?

46:00.552 --> 46:01.553
I was running late.

46:03.472 --> 46:04.473
Yep. I remember.

46:04.556 --> 46:06.642
So, we can do maintenance
another day, okay?

46:07.976 --> 46:10.229
Listen, if you get those kids out,
you will have done well.

46:10.312 --> 46:11.980
Okay, Kevin? You copy?

46:14.233 --> 46:16.318
Copy that. Have them lined up.

46:17.069 --> 46:18.153
I'm on my way.

47:05.742 --> 47:07.035
"And it was…"

47:07.119 --> 47:09.705
There's the bus. Okay. Stay seated.

47:09.788 --> 47:12.207
Stay sitting please, everybody.

47:18.338 --> 47:19.840
Twenty kids for evac?

47:20.507 --> 47:22.843
They're in there. Around to the right.

47:27.639 --> 47:28.891
- Hi.
- Hi.

47:28.974 --> 47:31.727
- Are you here for the kids?
- Yes, I am. Are they ready?

47:31.810 --> 47:33.478
Yep. We're gathering them up right now.

47:33.562 --> 47:34.730
- Okay.
- What's your name?

47:34.813 --> 47:36.940
- Kevin. And…
- Kevin, hi. I'm Mary.

47:37.024 --> 47:40.110
- Hi. As soon as we can gather…
- Yeah, great. We are…

47:40.194 --> 47:42.571
- We're gonna get 'em in line in a minute.
- Yeah.

47:42.654 --> 47:45.073
These kids, their parents
couldn't make it 'cause they work too--

47:45.157 --> 47:47.326
- Paradise Elementary. Got it.
- Right. The alternative drop-off.

47:47.409 --> 47:48.660
Yep. Got it. Ready to go.

47:48.744 --> 47:50.746
- Principal Hayes. Thank you for coming.
- Hi. Yep.

47:50.829 --> 47:52.164
- Okay…
- Sooner the better.

47:52.247 --> 47:54.082
…and we're just gonna keep it calm
for the kids.

47:54.166 --> 47:57.920
Kids, this is our bus driver, Kevin.
Can we say hi to Kevin?

47:58.003 --> 47:59.588
Hi, Kevin.

47:59.671 --> 48:01.924
Can I get you in two straight lines?

48:02.007 --> 48:03.842
Shortest in the front.
Tallest in the back.

48:03.926 --> 48:08.055
And Kevin is gonna drive you
to Paradise Elementary,

48:08.138 --> 48:11.391
where your parents
are going to pick you up.

48:11.475 --> 48:13.227
I'm gonna lead the line, Principal.

48:13.310 --> 48:16.313
If you could please take the back
and do a head count while we walk.

48:16.396 --> 48:18.524
If you're ready, raise your hand.

48:18.607 --> 48:20.192
Let me see your eyes. Eyes on me.

48:20.275 --> 48:21.693
I want to see everybody's eyes.

48:21.777 --> 48:23.111
- Are we ready?
- Yes.

48:23.195 --> 48:26.114
We're gonna walk calmly.
We're gonna walk slowly.

48:26.198 --> 48:27.658
We're gonna stay with our partners.

48:27.741 --> 48:29.743
- Okay, here we go.
- Yeah. Come on.

48:34.248 --> 48:37.584
- What do you think, like, ten minutes?
- Yeah, if we get a move on, yes.

48:37.668 --> 48:40.546
But the traffic's getting really busy
out there. So the quicker, the better.

48:40.629 --> 48:42.130
Okay. We have time.

48:42.798 --> 48:43.841
Well, you know, ma'am,

48:43.924 --> 48:46.718
I don't think you understand
the urgency of our situation here.

48:46.802 --> 48:49.137
I recognize the urgency of our situation.

48:49.221 --> 48:50.639
And it's Mary, not "ma'am."

48:50.722 --> 48:52.808
Hoods up if you have a hood!

48:52.891 --> 48:55.143
If you have a backpack, put it on top.

48:57.062 --> 48:59.606
Okay! It's okay!

48:59.690 --> 49:03.193
It's just a fire engine in the sky!
Use your backpacks, okay?

49:03.694 --> 49:04.778
All right.

49:06.154 --> 49:07.573
Find a seat on the bus, babe.

49:08.448 --> 49:10.325
Quietly, calmly, one single line.

49:11.034 --> 49:13.036
Not quickly, take your time.

49:15.205 --> 49:16.582
963 to Base,

49:17.124 --> 49:19.376
we're loading the kids on the bus now.

49:20.794 --> 49:23.964
The signal's bad.
I'll let you know when we're clear, over.

49:25.048 --> 49:29.178
Everybody, I want you to stay seated
and listen to everything Kevin says.

49:29.261 --> 49:31.430
- Okay?
- Wait!

49:31.513 --> 49:32.806
Alex! I need Alex!

49:32.890 --> 49:35.142
- Alex? Alex, honey, your mom is here.
- Alex!

49:35.225 --> 49:36.602
Okay, you have all your things?

49:36.685 --> 49:38.145
- You gotta go. Okay.
- Oh, thank God.

49:38.228 --> 49:39.897
Let's go.

49:39.980 --> 49:41.064
Okay, you are good to go.

49:41.148 --> 49:43.150
Whoa. Ma'am.

49:43.233 --> 49:44.693
No. You're coming. Yes.

49:44.776 --> 49:47.362
No. I have to lock up.

49:47.446 --> 49:49.323
No. You can't. I…

49:49.406 --> 49:50.949
I'm gonna drive and drop. Okay?

49:51.033 --> 49:53.452
I can't hang about
and hold any hands when I get there.

49:53.535 --> 49:55.704
I've got my own family
I gotta get home to.

49:55.787 --> 49:57.080
Okay? You gotta come.

49:58.415 --> 50:01.585
I don't think he can do this by himself.
I have to go with him.

50:01.668 --> 50:03.295
- Pipe down!
- It's fine.

50:03.378 --> 50:05.672
I'll get a ride
from one of the teachers there.

50:05.756 --> 50:08.592
- Here, take the evac for HQ.
- You okay to lock up alone?

50:08.675 --> 50:10.219
- Yeah.
- All right. I'm here.

50:10.302 --> 50:11.386
I'm coming.

50:13.847 --> 50:15.349
- We're good.
- Hang on.

50:15.432 --> 50:17.309
We got on the bus. We're gonna be there.

50:17.392 --> 50:19.394
It's gonna take ten minutes.

50:19.478 --> 50:20.979
Did you see those fire engines?

50:25.108 --> 50:28.362
Okay, here is the school's evac route.

50:30.864 --> 50:35.452
We are… the East line, so we're gonna
stay on Pentz all the way down,

50:35.536 --> 50:38.539
and then cut a right on Pearson
to get us to Paradise Elementary.

50:38.622 --> 50:41.375
I don't think
it's a good idea. Look at it.

50:41.458 --> 50:43.669
There's a better way out than Pentz right.

50:43.752 --> 50:46.421
Okay, but that's the plan.
So we're gonna stick to the plan.

50:46.505 --> 50:48.090
Whatever you say, teach.

50:50.008 --> 50:53.679
It's total gridlock.
Look how tight those roads are right now.

50:53.762 --> 50:57.057
It's gotta be at least 15 miles
of traffic trying to get to Chico.

50:57.140 --> 50:59.393
Chief, we're arriving at the fairgrounds.

50:59.476 --> 51:00.310
Copy that.

51:19.162 --> 51:21.623
I'm issuing a mandatory evacuation
on the whole town.

51:21.707 --> 51:23.375
All zones. Effective immediately.

51:23.458 --> 51:25.335
Chief, you can't do it. It'll be chaos.

51:25.419 --> 51:27.212
We're talking 26,000 people.

51:27.296 --> 51:28.881
If you get everyone moving out of town,

51:28.964 --> 51:30.382
you're never gonna get your engines in.

51:30.465 --> 51:32.467
You're not listening.
The fire's coming across the canyon.

51:32.551 --> 51:34.553
I've seen it with my own eyes.
It's moving fast.

51:34.636 --> 51:35.470
Here's the choice,

51:35.554 --> 51:38.056
bust the system or play by the book
and everybody dies.

51:38.140 --> 51:39.600
You want that on your conscience?

51:42.144 --> 51:43.979
Chief, we got the team
ordered early for ya.

51:44.062 --> 51:45.063
- Copy.
- All right.

51:48.108 --> 51:50.944
Hey, Chief. Mark Rogers of PG&E.

51:51.028 --> 51:53.113
I have a team here from headquarters.
We're available.

51:53.197 --> 51:55.616
Just get the power off in the town,
and we'll take care of the rest.

51:55.699 --> 51:56.783
- Yeah.
- Okay, listen.

51:56.867 --> 51:59.369
We gotta give the chief some space.
We will come to you in a second.

51:59.453 --> 52:01.830
Just… No, just wanted to say
we're available if you need us.

52:04.208 --> 52:06.460
Issue mandatory evac
order for the entire town.

52:06.543 --> 52:08.378
Copy, Chief. Oroville, Camp Ops.

52:08.462 --> 52:11.298
Base to 179. Are you clear?

52:11.381 --> 52:12.799
Are you out of East Paradise?

52:13.800 --> 52:16.220
- 179. We're out.
- Great.

52:16.303 --> 52:17.304
Who's left?

52:18.096 --> 52:19.765
963 is the only one left.

52:20.641 --> 52:21.642
That's all.

52:23.101 --> 52:24.186
Base to 963.

52:24.728 --> 52:27.314
Base to 963, are you out of East Paradise?

52:34.321 --> 52:35.489
963 to Base.

52:36.490 --> 52:37.574
Do you read?

52:38.825 --> 52:42.037
Don't be scared. The fire trucks
are responding to the fire.

52:42.120 --> 52:43.997
- They're doing their job.
- Anybody, 963 to Base.

52:44.081 --> 52:45.832
- They're keeping us safe.
- Can anybody hear me?

52:45.916 --> 52:49.253
Okay? We are on Pentz.
It is backed up going nowhere.

52:49.336 --> 52:51.839
963, come in please.

52:51.922 --> 52:53.090
Can you try his mobile?

52:57.427 --> 53:00.389
Why does he have to be the last bus
out of there? I swear to God.

53:00.472 --> 53:02.391
963 to Base, do you read?

53:03.684 --> 53:06.103
Let me know if you're getting this. Over.

53:08.063 --> 53:10.148
Do you have any safety protocols
on this bus?

53:10.232 --> 53:11.567
Yep. You got this,

53:12.609 --> 53:13.861
and you got that.

53:15.153 --> 53:17.698
Great. Yeah.
That'll make all the difference.

53:23.620 --> 53:24.621
So you're new here?

53:25.372 --> 53:27.124
No, I just came back a few months ago.

53:27.624 --> 53:28.876
Grew up here.

53:29.710 --> 53:31.003
What's that like?

53:32.838 --> 53:34.673
Not where I thought I'd be at 44.

53:36.633 --> 53:38.552
How long do you think this is gonna take?

53:38.635 --> 53:39.511
Hard to tell.

53:39.595 --> 53:42.097
If we'd have left the school on time,
you wouldn't have slow played me,

53:42.181 --> 53:45.017
it would have taken about ten minutes,
but now it's looking like 20-30.

53:46.018 --> 53:48.228
Guess we'll get there when we get there.
Okay, kiddies.

53:49.605 --> 53:54.860
Let's raise some of these windows
so the smoke doesn't get in.

53:54.943 --> 53:56.987
Hi. Is this fire command?

53:57.070 --> 54:00.365
This is Ruby Bishop at PUSD.
I've lost all radio communication,

54:00.449 --> 54:01.783
and I have a lost bus.

54:01.867 --> 54:04.620
It's number 963,
and it's over somewhere in East Paradise.

54:04.703 --> 54:06.705
Can you let me know
if your engines see him?

54:06.788 --> 54:07.623
Thank you.

54:07.706 --> 54:08.957
Okay…

54:10.167 --> 54:12.002
963, do you read?

54:13.921 --> 54:16.507
Kevin? Can you hear me? This is Base.

54:19.343 --> 54:20.719
Honey, let's…

54:21.303 --> 54:23.889
move this up so smoke doesn't get in.

54:24.890 --> 54:26.517
- What's your name?
- Benjamin.

54:26.600 --> 54:29.937
Benjamin, and you're in Miss Kristy's
class? That's right. I remember that.

54:31.104 --> 54:32.814
Miss Mary, there's another window.

54:32.898 --> 54:34.983
Yes. Let's get that one.

54:38.237 --> 54:39.863
Screw this.

54:41.949 --> 54:42.950
Kevin!

54:43.825 --> 54:45.744
What are you doing?
The plan is to stay on Pentz!

54:45.827 --> 54:48.914
Turning over to Clark. It runs parallel.
It's bound to be moving better.

54:48.997 --> 54:50.123
But that's not the plan.

54:50.207 --> 54:52.501
- The plan is to stay on Pentz.
- Screw the plan, teach.

54:52.584 --> 54:53.418
You know what?

54:53.502 --> 54:54.336
Hey, I could stay here

54:54.419 --> 54:56.213
in the middle of the traffic jam
if that's what you want.

54:56.296 --> 54:58.048
- Don't stop now, obviously.
- Want me to stay here?

54:58.131 --> 54:59.550
No shit. Let me drive.

55:02.886 --> 55:05.472
- What the hell is your problem?
- Look, you see that fire?

55:05.556 --> 55:07.641
It's like the fucking
Fourth of July, okay?

55:07.724 --> 55:10.018
I'd sit down if I were you.
I'm about to take a hard left.

55:10.102 --> 55:11.770
- Bunch down, everybody!
- Hold on!

55:15.107 --> 55:17.943
Oh, my God! Hold on, kids!

55:21.613 --> 55:23.282
Oh, my God! Kevin!

55:24.700 --> 55:25.701
Hold on!

55:26.493 --> 55:28.787
Jesus Christ.

55:29.538 --> 55:31.540
- We're clear.
- Is everyone okay?

55:34.585 --> 55:36.753
We're okay. Traffic is moving.

55:37.337 --> 55:39.673
Can you please ask before
you do something like that again?

55:39.756 --> 55:41.592
You wanna get there quicker
or you wanna go by the book?

55:41.675 --> 55:43.302
We have to be responsible.

55:43.385 --> 55:46.597
Yep, and I think that means getting these
kids to their parents as soon as possible.

55:46.680 --> 55:47.681
Don't you?

56:00.444 --> 56:03.155
- I'm not getting anything.
- Kevin, come in please.

56:03.906 --> 56:07.409
This is a code red alert.
Evacuate all zones immediately.

56:07.492 --> 56:09.578
Ruby, we gotta go.
I gotta get the power off.

56:09.661 --> 56:11.079
- I know.
- I'm getting my guys outta here.

56:11.163 --> 56:13.916
Okay. Take my keys. Okay?

56:17.336 --> 56:20.214
963, do you read?

56:36.772 --> 56:38.357
So, what about you? You always lived here?

56:40.984 --> 56:43.195
Yeah. Born and raised.

56:44.780 --> 56:46.031
Never was really my speed.

56:47.616 --> 56:48.951
Then why'd you come back?

56:49.993 --> 56:51.495
My dad died a few months ago.

56:53.288 --> 56:55.290
- Sorry.
- Nah, it's fine.

56:57.084 --> 56:58.293
We weren't close.

57:03.507 --> 57:04.508
So you staying?

57:05.259 --> 57:06.552
For now.

57:11.640 --> 57:13.475
What about you? Got family?

57:15.644 --> 57:16.895
Yeah.

57:16.979 --> 57:18.438
Married 19 years.

57:19.147 --> 57:21.483
A Paradise poster family too, huh?

57:22.776 --> 57:23.902
Yeah.

57:25.028 --> 57:26.363
One kid.

57:26.947 --> 57:29.366
Jake. He's 15.

57:30.576 --> 57:32.578
I was gonna go get him, but…

57:38.292 --> 57:39.710
I didn't realize. Sorry.

57:40.460 --> 57:41.795
It's fine.

57:41.879 --> 57:43.714
My sister will have gone for him.

57:43.797 --> 57:45.048
His dad's out of town.

57:49.386 --> 57:50.554
It'll be fine.

57:50.637 --> 57:53.265
We're gonna drop the kids off,
and then I'll go find him.

57:54.474 --> 57:56.727
- All right. How're we doing?
- Are we gonna be okay?

57:56.810 --> 57:58.145
Yes. We're gonna be okay, sweetie.

57:58.228 --> 57:59.313
Are our pets okay?

57:59.396 --> 58:01.398
When will we see our parents?

58:01.481 --> 58:03.150
We'll see them there, yeah?

58:03.901 --> 58:07.362
We're just trying to get you
to safety as soon as we can, okay?

58:07.446 --> 58:08.447
Yes, sweetie?

58:08.530 --> 58:10.574
When are we going to be there?

58:10.657 --> 58:13.327
We're gonna be there
as soon as we can, okay?

58:14.494 --> 58:15.704
You okay, sweetie?

58:16.997 --> 58:18.749
Do you want to sit up front
with somebody else,

58:18.832 --> 58:20.334
or do you want to be by yourself?

58:21.502 --> 58:24.546
Kevin, if you can hear me,
they're evacuating the whole town,

58:24.630 --> 58:27.466
and emergency services
are mustering 15 miles away

58:27.549 --> 58:29.676
at Chico Fairgrounds where it's safe.

58:29.760 --> 58:31.970
Do not drop those kids off.

58:32.054 --> 58:35.140
Just take 'em and come to Chico. Okay?

58:38.393 --> 58:40.229
Ruby, we're outta time. We gotta go.

58:40.312 --> 58:42.022
- I gotta get my guys out of here.
- Okay!

58:42.105 --> 58:43.357
Ruby!

58:45.234 --> 58:48.737
Kevin, if you can hear me,
I will see you in Chico, okay?

58:49.780 --> 58:50.781
Be careful. Base clear.

58:53.784 --> 58:54.785
Come on!

59:07.548 --> 59:09.883
Chief, the fire's spreading
fast through East Paradise.

59:09.967 --> 59:11.593
And I just got word from Division Hotel.

59:11.677 --> 59:14.888
You got a working fire in the cardiology
wing at Feather River Hospital.

59:14.972 --> 59:16.348
It's well established in the attic.

59:16.431 --> 59:18.725
You got about 15 to 20 patients
that are outside right now.

59:18.809 --> 59:20.310
We're working on getting them outta there.

59:20.394 --> 59:22.646
Do whatever you can in there
and save the hospital, okay?

59:22.729 --> 59:24.898
Get me Butte medics,
and tell them we need help.

59:24.982 --> 59:26.942
Chief.
Air Attack has grounded all aircraft.

59:27.025 --> 59:28.819
Now, I'll get you
an update as soon as I can,

59:28.902 --> 59:30.612
but right now nothing goes in the air.

59:30.696 --> 59:32.030
- Nothing.
- Goddamn it.

59:32.990 --> 59:35.868
Where are we with the evacuation route?
How's this traffic moving?

59:36.410 --> 59:38.537
You can see now
the fires across from Clark Road,

59:38.620 --> 59:40.038
they're getting impacted by fire.

59:40.122 --> 59:42.416
Pentz Road is gridlocked.

59:42.499 --> 59:45.169
Skyway is still open. It's moving slow.

59:45.252 --> 59:47.004
But what about all these abandoned cars?

59:47.087 --> 59:48.714
We're having major access issues.

59:48.797 --> 59:52.009
I want any vehicle blocking
traffic pushed off the road.

59:52.092 --> 59:53.594
Okay? Get dozers in there if you have to.

59:53.677 --> 59:54.511
Got it.

59:54.595 --> 59:57.097
We can't lose those four routes out.

59:57.181 --> 59:58.724
We lose those, it's game over.

59:59.600 --> 01:00:02.019
- Hey, everybody! Listen up!
- Everybody, quiet!

01:00:02.686 --> 01:00:04.688
This is no longer a wildland fire.

01:00:04.771 --> 01:00:06.106
This is burning home to home.

01:00:06.190 --> 01:00:07.774
This is a town fire.

01:00:07.858 --> 01:00:09.276
This is a mass casualty incident.

01:00:10.194 --> 01:00:11.904
That's what we're dealing with.

01:00:11.987 --> 01:00:15.199
So stay on with your people,
and do the best you can.

01:00:15.282 --> 01:00:17.075
- Copy, Chief.
- Copy that.

01:00:36.178 --> 01:00:38.472
Hey! What's the holdup?

01:00:38.555 --> 01:00:40.599
Got a roadblock up ahead!

01:00:41.350 --> 01:00:42.768
The freeway's jammed.

01:00:43.352 --> 01:00:44.478
Shit!

01:00:50.609 --> 01:00:51.652
Come on.

01:00:52.694 --> 01:00:54.363
Where do you need to get to?

01:00:55.113 --> 01:00:57.366
- After we drop off the kids.
- Magalia.

01:00:58.325 --> 01:01:00.035
My son's up there with his grandma.

01:01:00.661 --> 01:01:02.579
I told them I'd be coming straight home.

01:01:03.121 --> 01:01:04.665
Well, they'll get the evacuation alerts.

01:01:05.249 --> 01:01:06.542
Won't they?

01:01:08.585 --> 01:01:09.837
You signed up for them, right?

01:01:10.921 --> 01:01:12.005
I…

01:01:16.552 --> 01:01:18.262
You know, I kept getting the noti…

01:01:18.345 --> 01:01:19.888
notifications from the town hall

01:01:19.972 --> 01:01:21.390
and I just kept putting it off.

01:01:22.099 --> 01:01:23.767
Well, can his grandma drive?

01:01:24.685 --> 01:01:25.686
Nope.

01:01:37.823 --> 01:01:38.991
Miss Mary, help.

01:01:39.074 --> 01:01:42.035
Miss Mary,
there's smoke coming from that house.

01:01:44.204 --> 01:01:45.372
Fire on the left.

01:01:46.832 --> 01:01:49.501
- Fire on the left. Bunch down.
- Stay away from the windows.

01:01:49.585 --> 01:01:51.336
Everybody stay off the windows.

01:01:53.755 --> 01:01:54.840
Hey.

01:01:55.924 --> 01:01:57.009
Just let me in!

01:01:57.759 --> 01:01:58.969
Come on!

01:01:59.052 --> 01:02:00.804
Buddy, I got kids on the bus.

01:02:02.681 --> 01:02:05.684
Stay calm.
Kevin's trying to get us through.

01:02:06.852 --> 01:02:08.687
Mary, take a seat.

01:02:09.313 --> 01:02:11.148
- What? Why?
- Take a seat. I need you to drive.

01:02:11.231 --> 01:02:12.608
- I need you to drive.
- I don't know how.

01:02:12.691 --> 01:02:15.652
I've gotta clear traffic in the left lane.
I need you to take over the bus.

01:02:15.736 --> 01:02:16.904
It's easy. Okay?

01:02:16.987 --> 01:02:18.906
You put your foot on the brake,
when I say come, hit the gas.

01:02:18.989 --> 01:02:21.700
It's easy. Okay? Yes, you do.
Hold the brake.

01:02:21.783 --> 01:02:23.535
- Okay.
- When I say, "Come on," come on.

01:02:23.619 --> 01:02:24.536
- Okay?
- Okay.

01:02:26.872 --> 01:02:27.956
Stay seated.

01:02:28.749 --> 01:02:29.750
Where's Kevin?

01:02:29.833 --> 01:02:30.959
Back it up.

01:02:34.046 --> 01:02:37.299
Back this truck up.
We gotta get this fire engine in.

01:02:37.382 --> 01:02:39.801
- Let's go. Keep 'em going!
- Hey. What's going on?

01:02:40.469 --> 01:02:42.554
- What're you doing? What's the plan?
- We got people trapped on Pentz.

01:02:42.638 --> 01:02:43.639
Those people got priority.

01:02:43.722 --> 01:02:45.265
- The main fire's over there.
- See the school bus?

01:02:45.349 --> 01:02:48.268
I have 22 kids on that bus.
I gotta get them to their parents, okay?

01:02:48.352 --> 01:02:49.394
Where's Kevin?

01:02:49.478 --> 01:02:51.271
I need you to hold traffic here
so we can come through.

01:02:51.355 --> 01:02:53.565
I gotta clear this traffic
to let the fire truck through.

01:02:53.649 --> 01:02:55.526
Get on the radio
and call fuckin' backup, will you?

01:02:55.609 --> 01:02:58.779
Our comms are down. They've been
down for about 40 minutes or so.

01:02:58.862 --> 01:03:01.365
Get back in your car.
We'll get you through when we can.

01:03:02.407 --> 01:03:03.825
Get back in your car, sir.

01:03:04.618 --> 01:03:06.245
- Get back in your car.
- Go left.

01:03:06.328 --> 01:03:08.789
We gotta get the fire truck
and this bus through first.

01:03:08.872 --> 01:03:09.873
Go!

01:03:12.751 --> 01:03:14.378
Go!

01:03:15.587 --> 01:03:16.588
Hold it!

01:03:17.881 --> 01:03:18.924
Go!

01:03:19.675 --> 01:03:20.634
Come on.

01:03:23.679 --> 01:03:24.680
Okay.

01:03:25.556 --> 01:03:27.349
Let the fire truck and the bus through!

01:03:27.432 --> 01:03:28.767
Come on, go!

01:03:29.726 --> 01:03:30.727
Yes.

01:03:31.728 --> 01:03:33.188
Go!

01:03:34.523 --> 01:03:35.941
Come on!

01:03:36.024 --> 01:03:37.568
I don't want to hit you.

01:03:37.651 --> 01:03:38.902
Are we gonna be okay?

01:03:39.903 --> 01:03:40.737
Come on.

01:03:51.081 --> 01:03:52.082
Come on!

01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:55.085
Holy shit.

01:03:55.169 --> 01:03:56.170
Yes!

01:04:00.340 --> 01:04:01.758
We did it. We made it through.

01:04:07.055 --> 01:04:07.973
What was wrong?

01:04:08.056 --> 01:04:10.058
Radios are down. It's chaos.

01:04:15.439 --> 01:04:17.149
A minute out, minute out.

01:04:17.232 --> 01:04:18.942
Minute out! Are we ready?

01:04:19.026 --> 01:04:23.030
963. We are one minute out from drop-off.
One minute out from drop-off.

01:04:24.781 --> 01:04:26.074
Nice driving.

01:04:28.202 --> 01:04:30.579
Thanks. Not so bad yourself.

01:04:33.832 --> 01:04:35.709
You could always be a traffic cop

01:04:37.127 --> 01:04:38.754
if you're looking for a fresh start.

01:04:39.838 --> 01:04:41.673
I'd take a hard pass on that.

01:04:52.392 --> 01:04:55.854
Okay, kids. You can get your things ready.
Be ready to get off the bus.

01:04:55.938 --> 01:04:58.357
I'm gonna get you to your parents
as quickly as we can.

01:05:14.623 --> 01:05:16.250
- Our parents…
- The school's…

01:05:16.333 --> 01:05:18.961
- Oh, my God.
- No! Where are they?

01:05:21.797 --> 01:05:24.341
- No.
- Where are they?

01:05:29.805 --> 01:05:30.889
Oh, shit!

01:05:31.974 --> 01:05:33.517
I want my mom.

01:05:34.309 --> 01:05:36.061
I'll go see if anybody's there.

01:05:46.697 --> 01:05:48.031
Hello!

01:05:48.824 --> 01:05:50.242
Hello!

01:06:10.053 --> 01:06:11.722
They're not here.

01:06:11.805 --> 01:06:13.432
There's no one here.

01:06:15.267 --> 01:06:18.687
I don't know why they didn't warn us or…

01:06:19.188 --> 01:06:20.272
What do we do?

01:06:21.148 --> 01:06:22.232
I don't know.

01:06:22.316 --> 01:06:23.275
What…

01:06:28.739 --> 01:06:31.366
We gotta get outta here.
We gotta get these kids out of here.

01:06:31.450 --> 01:06:33.869
Try to get them down
to the main evac center in Chico.

01:06:36.205 --> 01:06:38.290
And then we can come back for our kids.

01:06:38.373 --> 01:06:39.750
Miss Mary!

01:06:39.833 --> 01:06:41.668
I'm coming.

01:06:50.302 --> 01:06:51.386
Sit down.

01:06:51.887 --> 01:06:53.847
- Ava needs you.
- What's wrong with Ava?

01:06:53.931 --> 01:06:55.516
She won't come from under her seat.

01:06:55.599 --> 01:06:57.226
- What? She's on the floor?
- Yeah, she needs you.

01:06:57.309 --> 01:06:58.977
- Why? What's wrong with her?
- She won't get up!

01:06:59.478 --> 01:07:02.147
- She's scared.
- Ava. Honey, no.

01:07:03.482 --> 01:07:05.400
What are you doing down there?

01:07:06.985 --> 01:07:08.779
Are you okay?

01:07:08.862 --> 01:07:09.863
No?

01:07:10.822 --> 01:07:13.450
- It's all a little bit scary.
- Okay.

01:07:13.534 --> 01:07:15.410
- Mary, are we good?
- Yeah. Good to go.

01:07:15.494 --> 01:07:16.495
Okay.

01:07:25.087 --> 01:07:26.213
Are you scared?

01:07:26.296 --> 01:07:28.340
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:07:28.423 --> 01:07:29.508
I know.

01:07:30.092 --> 01:07:31.510
I'm scared too.

01:07:32.094 --> 01:07:33.220
Can I give you a hug?

01:07:38.642 --> 01:07:40.394
There you go. Come on.

01:07:51.113 --> 01:07:52.614
Be as brave as you can be.

01:07:59.997 --> 01:08:03.500
Chief, you've got 27,000 people
in Paradise,

01:08:03.584 --> 01:08:04.793
12,000 in Magalia.

01:08:04.877 --> 01:08:06.879
You've got maybe 8,000 people evacuated,

01:08:06.962 --> 01:08:10.174
which means you've got 30,000 people
left in the footprint of the fire.

01:08:10.257 --> 01:08:11.466
Finney, come here a second.

01:08:11.550 --> 01:08:13.302
Update on the infrastructure.
How we doing with that?

01:08:13.385 --> 01:08:16.095
So, infrastructure, Chief,
we got multiple schools in the town here.

01:08:16.180 --> 01:08:19.140
We have two that are being impacted
immediately along Pentz road.

01:08:19.224 --> 01:08:22.895
I also have a report that a school bus
came out of Ponderosa Elementary

01:08:22.978 --> 01:08:25.479
with 22 kids on it.
It's unaccounted for right now, but--

01:08:25.564 --> 01:08:26.939
Keep me updated on that.

01:08:27.024 --> 01:08:28.358
We also have multiple gas stations.

01:08:28.942 --> 01:08:30.194
We have two propane facilities.

01:08:30.277 --> 01:08:33.238
One in Skyway in between Pentz and Clark
and another one in Magalia.

01:08:33.322 --> 01:08:35.616
- Can you shut them down?
- I'll work on it.

01:08:35.698 --> 01:08:38.035
Part of the evacuation problem,
power lines are coming down.

01:08:38.118 --> 01:08:39.703
They cannot get across the road.

01:08:39.786 --> 01:08:42.581
Firefighters are cutting them right now
to open it up, but we're getting reports--

01:08:42.663 --> 01:08:43.874
Where's PG&E?

01:08:43.957 --> 01:08:45.834
We're getting reports
of active power lines.

01:08:45.917 --> 01:08:47.002
- PG&E.
- Yeah.

01:08:47.669 --> 01:08:49.171
- I thought the power was off.
- It is.

01:08:49.254 --> 01:08:50.255
Tell them what's going on.

01:08:50.339 --> 01:08:51.590
Why is your power on?

01:08:51.673 --> 01:08:53.216
It's… Look, we're working on it.

01:08:53.300 --> 01:08:55.051
We got civilians
driving across power lines.

01:08:55.135 --> 01:08:56.595
- We got firefighters cutting lines…
- I understand.

01:08:56.678 --> 01:08:57.930
- I understand.
- …and lines are still arcing?

01:08:58.013 --> 01:09:00.474
- You told me the power was off.
- Look. All the automatic power is off.

01:09:00.557 --> 01:09:02.309
Thereafter it's manual switches
that have to be done.

01:09:02.392 --> 01:09:03.935
- We're working as fast as we can.
- I don't give a shit.

01:09:04.019 --> 01:09:05.604
- I understand.
- Do you know what's going on here?

01:09:05.687 --> 01:09:07.481
Shut the fucking power off!

01:09:07.564 --> 01:09:09.024
- Okay.
- What the fuck is wrong with you?

01:09:09.107 --> 01:09:12.653
I've got firefighters in there!
There's 30,000 people in there!

01:09:21.995 --> 01:09:23.663
What the hell are we gonna do?

01:09:23.747 --> 01:09:25.290
The fire's behind us.

01:09:25.374 --> 01:09:28.001
We gotta stay ahead of it
and stay due southwest.

01:09:28.085 --> 01:09:29.545
That clear patch of sky,
that's our way out.

01:09:29.627 --> 01:09:31.880
We stay out of the fire,
and we head down to Chico from there.

01:09:32.756 --> 01:09:34.550
Pentz and Clark are out,

01:09:34.633 --> 01:09:37.010
- so that leaves Neal and Skyway.
- Yeah.

01:09:37.094 --> 01:09:38.220
Yeah.

01:09:38.303 --> 01:09:40.180
Neal is the furthest away,
but maybe that's good.

01:09:40.264 --> 01:09:41.348
Maybe there's less traffic there.

01:09:41.430 --> 01:09:43.809
But you have to take Roe Road
to get to Neal.

01:09:43.892 --> 01:09:46.770
It's narrow,
and it's full of 180 degree turns.

01:09:46.854 --> 01:09:49.189
It's not built for a 35,000 pound bus.

01:09:49.273 --> 01:09:50.732
We'd be trapped down there.
There's no way out.

01:09:50.816 --> 01:09:53.359
- That really just leaves us Skyway.
- Skyway. Right.

01:09:53.443 --> 01:09:56.280
- It's wide, four lanes, straight.
- Yeah.

01:09:58.448 --> 01:10:00.701
- Let's try Skyway. Okay.
- Skyway.

01:10:00.784 --> 01:10:03.662
You don't know where they are, do you?

01:10:04.246 --> 01:10:05.247
What, honey?

01:10:05.330 --> 01:10:06.582
Our parents.

01:10:07.082 --> 01:10:08.500
You don't know where they are.

01:10:10.419 --> 01:10:13.005
No, honey, we don't,
but we're gonna find them.

01:10:13.088 --> 01:10:14.673
We're gonna find their parents,
right, Kevin?

01:10:14.756 --> 01:10:16.633
Yeah, we're gonna find them. Yeah.

01:10:16.717 --> 01:10:18.552
I need you to take your seat, sweetie.

01:10:20.095 --> 01:10:22.639
You wanna sit down up here?

01:10:24.057 --> 01:10:26.018
- Have a seat.
- Here.

01:10:26.101 --> 01:10:27.227
Yeah, this is fine.

01:10:30.105 --> 01:10:31.398
What's your name?

01:10:31.481 --> 01:10:32.482
Toby.

01:10:34.318 --> 01:10:35.485
Your parents work out of town?

01:10:35.569 --> 01:10:36.904
My mom does.

01:10:38.488 --> 01:10:39.823
I don't see my dad.

01:10:43.744 --> 01:10:47.289
I'll tell you what, Toby.
We're gonna get you back to your mom.

01:10:47.372 --> 01:10:49.541
You hear me?
We're gonna get you back to your mom.

01:10:49.625 --> 01:10:52.628
We're gonna get you back to your son,
and we're gonna get me back to mine.

01:10:53.212 --> 01:10:54.296
That's what's going to happen.

01:10:55.088 --> 01:10:56.131
Okay?

01:10:58.634 --> 01:10:59.468
Okay.

01:10:59.551 --> 01:11:02.471
So, Chief, the fire is
spreading through most of Paradise,

01:11:02.554 --> 01:11:04.806
both business and residential areas,

01:11:04.890 --> 01:11:07.518
and we're getting reports
of significant structure loss,

01:11:07.601 --> 01:11:09.436
and Air Attack is still grounded
with no ETA.

01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:10.521
- Copy that.
- Hey, Chief.

01:11:10.604 --> 01:11:12.189
I've checked in with division.

01:11:12.272 --> 01:11:15.943
Last report of that bus was coming down
Clark Road south of Elliott. Okay?

01:11:16.026 --> 01:11:17.444
I just got word from Division Hotel

01:11:17.528 --> 01:11:19.446
that Paradise Elementary
is well involved in fire.

01:11:19.530 --> 01:11:20.572
They're not there.

01:11:40.050 --> 01:11:41.385
Mary, can you see these cables?

01:11:42.219 --> 01:11:43.303
- Yeah.
- All right.

01:11:47.808 --> 01:11:50.018
Oh, my God. Watch out.

01:11:50.102 --> 01:11:51.395
Got it.

01:11:57.109 --> 01:11:58.777
Kevin, on the right! Kevin!

01:12:01.822 --> 01:12:03.031
Power line on the right!

01:12:07.327 --> 01:12:10.038
- The whole road's coming down.
- Oh, my God.

01:12:13.792 --> 01:12:15.377
It's falling!

01:12:16.753 --> 01:12:18.255
Watch out!

01:12:20.174 --> 01:12:21.717
Oh, my God.

01:12:24.428 --> 01:12:25.679
Going left!

01:12:29.224 --> 01:12:31.059
It's gonna cut through to Skyway.

01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:32.936
We can make it. It's just down here.

01:12:33.020 --> 01:12:35.564
Kids, hold on! Hold onto something!

01:12:41.820 --> 01:12:43.071
- Hang on!
- Oh, my God.

01:12:49.995 --> 01:12:51.163
Shit!

01:12:59.713 --> 01:13:02.466
Keep it in check!
Back it up! Come on back!

01:13:05.636 --> 01:13:08.347
We're blocked. We're totally blocked in.

01:13:13.977 --> 01:13:19.191
We gotta get off, find a way to Roe,
and try to make a way out on Neal.

01:13:19.274 --> 01:13:21.193
It's our only chance right now.

01:13:22.152 --> 01:13:23.987
- How are we gonna get out of here?
- Look for a way off. Left or right.

01:13:24.071 --> 01:13:25.280
I'm looking.

01:13:26.949 --> 01:13:29.409
I don't see anything. There's no way out.
I don't see… It's everywhere.

01:13:29.493 --> 01:13:32.037
It's all around us.
How are we gonna get out of here?

01:13:33.205 --> 01:13:34.289
Oh, my God!

01:13:36.333 --> 01:13:37.626
Look straight ahead.

01:13:37.709 --> 01:13:39.670
- Don't look at that.
- Straight ahead!

01:13:39.753 --> 01:13:41.839
Get out the fucking car!

01:13:44.132 --> 01:13:45.634
Kevin, there's looters.

01:13:46.134 --> 01:13:48.178
- Open up. Let me in!
- Get off the windows!

01:13:48.262 --> 01:13:49.304
Stay away from the windows!

01:13:49.388 --> 01:13:51.640
- Down! Get down!
- Stay away from the windows!

01:13:53.141 --> 01:13:54.518
Give us the bus!

01:13:55.936 --> 01:13:58.021
- Mary!
- Open it!

01:13:58.105 --> 01:14:00.315
He has a gun! Kevin, he has a gun!

01:14:00.399 --> 01:14:01.942
Open it!

01:14:02.025 --> 01:14:04.236
Down! Duck. I said duck.

01:14:04.319 --> 01:14:06.321
Open the door!

01:14:06.405 --> 01:14:08.866
We have to get out of here.

01:14:08.949 --> 01:14:10.158
We have to get out of here.

01:14:10.242 --> 01:14:12.744
On the left, Kevin, there's a gap.

01:14:12.828 --> 01:14:14.371
Kevin, there's a gap. Go left.

01:14:15.414 --> 01:14:16.874
Left. Go, go, go, go.

01:14:19.418 --> 01:14:20.878
It's closing.

01:14:23.589 --> 01:14:25.424
We're through.

01:14:29.761 --> 01:14:31.221
Stay with your family, please.

01:14:31.305 --> 01:14:34.308
This is the safe area, sir.
We need you to stay here…

01:14:35.392 --> 01:14:37.603
- Let's go.
- That's my daughter.

01:14:37.686 --> 01:14:39.563
- Out of the way.
- Watch your back.

01:14:39.646 --> 01:14:41.148
- Go!
- Move!

01:14:42.524 --> 01:14:44.526
Just keep going.

01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:46.528
Hold on.

01:14:46.612 --> 01:14:48.780
I'm with the Paradise
Unified School District.

01:14:48.864 --> 01:14:50.157
- Where are you from?
- Straight up.

01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:51.491
Thank you. That's where the busses are.

01:14:51.575 --> 01:14:53.076
Okay. Thank you. Just keep going.

01:14:55.579 --> 01:14:57.623
This is the… Yeah, there they are.

01:14:57.706 --> 01:14:58.957
Let me out.

01:15:01.543 --> 01:15:03.086
- Cesar?
- Ruby.

01:15:03.170 --> 01:15:05.255
Cesar. You heard any news?

01:15:05.964 --> 01:15:08.008
- Nothing.
- 963's not here?

01:15:08.091 --> 01:15:09.343
Hasn't made it back yet.

01:15:09.927 --> 01:15:11.345
Shit.

01:15:12.554 --> 01:15:14.223
Ruby, the parents are here.

01:15:14.306 --> 01:15:17.184
Okay.

01:15:22.648 --> 01:15:25.400
963 to Base. Do you read?

01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:31.198
- Miss Mary, I don't have any water left.
- 963 to all vehicles.

01:15:31.281 --> 01:15:33.951
- Do you read? Any vehicles, do you read?
- I'm thirsty. I'm way too hot.

01:15:34.034 --> 01:15:35.494
Okay.

01:15:35.577 --> 01:15:36.912
Here, honey.

01:15:37.454 --> 01:15:39.498
Get a folder or a notebook or something…

01:15:39.581 --> 01:15:41.708
Hey, listen, we just got off Skyway.
It was a no-go.

01:15:41.792 --> 01:15:42.835
Here. Use it like this.

01:15:42.918 --> 01:15:45.587
We're gonna try
and make our way out through Neal.

01:15:45.671 --> 01:15:48.257
Stay out of the fire.
Get out that way. It's our only shot.

01:15:48.340 --> 01:15:50.300
Miss Mary, we really need some water.

01:15:50.384 --> 01:15:52.177
Hang in there, sweetie.
I know. It's really hot.

01:15:54.054 --> 01:15:56.139
Kevin, the kids are not gonna last.

01:15:56.223 --> 01:15:58.642
They need water.
They're hot, and they're thirsty.

01:16:04.690 --> 01:16:06.859
- What's happening?
- What is that?

01:16:07.401 --> 01:16:08.694
What the hell is that?

01:16:09.945 --> 01:16:12.739
I can't breathe.
It's coming through the vents.

01:16:14.408 --> 01:16:17.202
The smoke. The smoke is getting in.
Kevin, the smoke is coming in.

01:16:17.786 --> 01:16:19.121
It's coming through the AC.

01:16:19.955 --> 01:16:21.206
Then turn it off.

01:16:21.290 --> 01:16:22.749
It's gonna make the heat worse, but okay.

01:16:22.833 --> 01:16:24.126
We have to try something.

01:16:25.544 --> 01:16:26.962
Okay, it's off.

01:16:32.551 --> 01:16:34.678
We must be inside the smoke column.

01:16:34.761 --> 01:16:37.181
- Watch out.
- Yeah. I see it.

01:16:40.267 --> 01:16:41.268
Meadow Creek Park.

01:16:42.769 --> 01:16:44.688
Yeah. There's a back exit.

01:16:45.397 --> 01:16:46.481
What?

01:16:46.565 --> 01:16:48.525
I worked here one summer as a kid.

01:16:49.568 --> 01:16:51.195
It leads out to Roe Road,

01:16:51.278 --> 01:16:54.531
and then we can get over to Neal,
and then we're out. Okay?

01:16:54.615 --> 01:16:56.158
- Yes.
- Yes.

01:16:59.244 --> 01:17:01.246
Miss. Ma'am.

01:17:01.872 --> 01:17:03.999
- Yeah?
- There's something wrong with Shannon.

01:17:04.082 --> 01:17:06.043
- She needs your help.
- She's wheezing a little bit.

01:17:06.126 --> 01:17:08.003
What's wrong, honey?

01:17:08.086 --> 01:17:10.088
Okay. Don't talk.

01:17:10.172 --> 01:17:13.050
Just breathe slowly, okay? Slowly.
Try to slow down your breathing.

01:17:13.675 --> 01:17:15.928
Okay. You just need to drink some water.

01:17:16.011 --> 01:17:18.680
Can everybody just look in their backpack

01:17:18.764 --> 01:17:22.351
and make sure you don't have,
like, a juice box or something?

01:17:24.269 --> 01:17:27.356
Kevin, we have to find water
or she's gonna stroke out.

01:17:27.940 --> 01:17:29.691
We have to get off the bus now.

01:17:32.611 --> 01:17:34.071
- Right there.
- Yep.

01:17:34.154 --> 01:17:35.864
- Yes. Okay.
- Yep.

01:17:35.948 --> 01:17:38.617
Okay. We can't stop for long.
I'll be two minutes.

01:17:38.700 --> 01:17:39.993
No.

01:17:40.077 --> 01:17:41.578
You need to stay on the bus.

01:17:41.662 --> 01:17:43.664
If the fire comes, you have to drive them.

01:17:44.331 --> 01:17:47.084
Let me go. I can do it.
Two minutes. I'll be right back.

01:17:47.626 --> 01:17:48.669
I can do it.

01:17:49.169 --> 01:17:50.295
I can do it.

01:17:51.380 --> 01:17:52.923
Miss Mary, where are you going?

01:17:53.006 --> 01:17:55.008
Miss Mary, come back.

01:18:02.766 --> 01:18:04.351
Where did Mary go?

01:18:12.067 --> 01:18:13.110
Shit.

01:18:18.615 --> 01:18:20.534
Do you know where Miss Mary is?

01:18:20.617 --> 01:18:22.411
She just went to look for some water.

01:18:22.494 --> 01:18:24.079
Just give her a minute.

01:18:24.162 --> 01:18:25.622
Please come back, Miss Mary.

01:18:25.706 --> 01:18:26.874
Where is she going?

01:18:27.499 --> 01:18:29.293
I can't see her.

01:18:42.264 --> 01:18:43.515
Come on.

01:18:44.057 --> 01:18:45.225
Come on.

01:18:46.852 --> 01:18:48.395
Come back.

01:19:14.296 --> 01:19:15.297
Yes. Yes.

01:19:18.967 --> 01:19:21.803
Got it. Oh, my God. Got it.

01:19:27.226 --> 01:19:28.352
Mary!

01:19:30.938 --> 01:19:32.940
Mary!

01:19:54.253 --> 01:19:55.462
Mary!

01:20:00.217 --> 01:20:01.426
Mary!

01:20:03.804 --> 01:20:05.764
- Mary!
- What do we do now?

01:20:12.771 --> 01:20:14.940
- Mary!
- I'm coming!

01:20:15.566 --> 01:20:17.025
I'm coming!

01:20:18.777 --> 01:20:20.362
- Go.
- Help me.

01:20:20.445 --> 01:20:22.030
Get the water.

01:20:24.575 --> 01:20:25.659
Miss Mary's here.

01:20:34.126 --> 01:20:35.794
- Okay.
- You okay?

01:20:35.878 --> 01:20:38.338
I'm okay.

01:20:47.472 --> 01:20:49.725
Can somebody get this water to Shannon?

01:20:53.520 --> 01:20:54.605
Oh, my God!

01:21:00.944 --> 01:21:03.071
Duck! Down! Cover your heads!

01:21:11.830 --> 01:21:13.498
- Shit!
- Oh, my God!

01:21:17.753 --> 01:21:20.255
Everybody, hold on!
Stay away from the windows.

01:21:20.339 --> 01:21:21.840
Everyone, hold on!

01:21:22.508 --> 01:21:25.719
Oh, my God.
We gotta go right. That's the way out.

01:21:32.601 --> 01:21:33.977
Oh, my God!

01:21:38.440 --> 01:21:39.274
Hold on!

01:21:42.402 --> 01:21:45.531
Okay. Stay down.

01:21:47.699 --> 01:21:49.326
On the right.

01:21:49.409 --> 01:21:51.036
That burnt building on the right.

01:21:53.664 --> 01:21:55.666
This is the way out. That's it.

01:21:56.416 --> 01:21:59.169
Here it is. This is the exit.
This takes us to Roe.

01:22:06.093 --> 01:22:08.303
Hello, everyone. If I could get y'all in.

01:22:09.763 --> 01:22:11.098
My name is Ruby Bishop.

01:22:11.765 --> 01:22:13.600
I am the school's
director of transportation,

01:22:13.684 --> 01:22:15.435
and I just wanna give you an update.

01:22:16.019 --> 01:22:17.437
I know y'all are worried,

01:22:17.521 --> 01:22:20.983
but I want you to know first and foremost
that your children were evacuated

01:22:21.066 --> 01:22:24.319
from Ponderosa Elementary
earlier this morning. Okay?

01:22:24.403 --> 01:22:25.696
When will we know more?

01:22:26.238 --> 01:22:30.158
Unfortunately,
shortly after leaving the school,

01:22:30.242 --> 01:22:32.411
the fire destroyed
our radio communication.

01:22:32.494 --> 01:22:36.790
So we have not had contact
with the bus since it left Ponderosa.

01:22:36.874 --> 01:22:37.916
Wait, you don't know where they are?

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:41.753
All I know is that they're probably
somewhere over in East Paradise.

01:22:41.837 --> 01:22:43.505
East Paradise is on fire!

01:22:43.589 --> 01:22:48.218
I know, but I want you to know
that both police and fire command

01:22:48.302 --> 01:22:50.888
are looking for them out there, okay?

01:22:50.971 --> 01:22:52.890
They're doing their best,

01:22:52.973 --> 01:22:56.602
but you must know that your children
are on the bus

01:22:56.685 --> 01:22:59.438
with a driver
and a teacher named Mary Ludwig.

01:22:59.521 --> 01:23:01.773
Some of you may know Mrs. Ludwig?

01:23:01.857 --> 01:23:03.525
- Okay.
- Which driver is it?

01:23:03.609 --> 01:23:06.361
Yes. His name is Kevin McKay.
He's a new driver to our district.

01:23:06.445 --> 01:23:08.280
- New driver?
- Listen…

01:23:09.239 --> 01:23:11.200
Everybody, please.

01:23:11.283 --> 01:23:12.284
Please. I know.

01:23:12.367 --> 01:23:14.328
I know this is really difficult news.

01:23:14.411 --> 01:23:15.996
- He's a good driver.
- Kevin McKay.

01:23:16.079 --> 01:23:20.083
I can vouch for Kevin McKay,
as can all of my drivers.

01:23:20.167 --> 01:23:23.253
He is a good man,
and he is gonna do everything he can.

01:23:24.129 --> 01:23:25.506
You have to trust him.

01:23:25.589 --> 01:23:30.552
I trust him, and right now
he is all we have got out there. Okay?

01:23:39.353 --> 01:23:41.355
This is it. This is Roe Road.

01:23:42.439 --> 01:23:43.524
Fire's behind us.

01:23:44.650 --> 01:23:48.278
Okay, a couple of miles on this
should get us out towards Neal.

01:23:49.071 --> 01:23:50.072
Okay.

01:23:51.240 --> 01:23:52.241
Okay.

01:23:56.662 --> 01:23:58.455
Rocks on the right.

01:24:04.002 --> 01:24:05.087
Watch your left.

01:24:09.007 --> 01:24:11.885
- There's a drop-off.
- I'm scared.

01:24:11.969 --> 01:24:13.470
We're gonna be okay, guys.

01:24:13.971 --> 01:24:16.807
You don't need to worry.
We're gonna get through this, okay?

01:24:21.687 --> 01:24:22.855
Watch out.

01:24:23.939 --> 01:24:24.940
Mary.

01:24:26.483 --> 01:24:28.235
What do I have over there?

01:24:28.318 --> 01:24:29.486
Four feet?

01:24:29.570 --> 01:24:31.989
Two. Maybe two and a half.

01:24:35.951 --> 01:24:38.370
Chief, our fire in Butte Creek Canyon

01:24:38.453 --> 01:24:40.956
and our fire in the west branch
have merged in Paradise.

01:24:41.039 --> 01:24:42.708
It's burning aligned with the wind,

01:24:42.791 --> 01:24:45.043
burning to the southwest portion
of Paradise.

01:24:45.127 --> 01:24:47.379
The only area that hasn't burned,

01:24:47.462 --> 01:24:50.883
and the fire is heading in this direction,
is this area right here.

01:24:50.966 --> 01:24:52.634
Foster Road. Roe Road.

01:24:52.718 --> 01:24:54.511
Hey, these are tight roads.

01:24:54.595 --> 01:24:56.722
A lot of structures in there.
It's all downhill.

01:24:56.805 --> 01:24:59.641
You've got numerous spot fires
being reported down here already.

01:24:59.725 --> 01:25:02.561
This area's gonna be fully engulfed
in fire very soon.

01:25:02.644 --> 01:25:04.563
We have got zero resources
to put down here.

01:25:04.646 --> 01:25:06.064
They're all engaged up here.

01:25:06.148 --> 01:25:07.149
Whatever's down here,

01:25:07.232 --> 01:25:09.860
they're gonna have to figure out for
themselves how to get out of Paradise.

01:25:09.943 --> 01:25:12.279
We've got nothing to give 'em.
Absolutely nothing.

01:25:28.253 --> 01:25:29.546
Miss Mary.

01:25:29.630 --> 01:25:31.048
What are they doing over there?

01:25:32.090 --> 01:25:33.342
Who are those people?

01:25:36.553 --> 01:25:37.554
What are they doing?

01:25:38.639 --> 01:25:40.641
Why are they going back towards the fire?

01:25:50.859 --> 01:25:52.319
Here!

01:25:53.737 --> 01:25:56.907
Yo! Hey! Stop!

01:25:57.866 --> 01:25:59.826
No. Come around this side.

01:26:00.702 --> 01:26:02.120
Is there a way out down there?

01:26:02.204 --> 01:26:03.622
That fire's burning across the ridge.

01:26:03.705 --> 01:26:05.624
- People are dying down there.
- We got out on foot.

01:26:05.707 --> 01:26:08.669
Do not go that way.
The trailer park, everything is burning.

01:26:08.752 --> 01:26:10.337
Everything. There's no way out.

01:26:10.420 --> 01:26:12.923
- What the hell are we gonna do?
- I just need to get to Neal Road.

01:26:13.006 --> 01:26:15.467
No, you can't go to Neal Road.
It's on fire.

01:26:15.551 --> 01:26:18.136
You don't want these kids
to see what we just saw.

01:26:19.096 --> 01:26:20.180
Trust me.

01:26:20.764 --> 01:26:21.765
Do not go that way.

01:26:22.474 --> 01:26:24.059
Hey, we're gonna take our chances.

01:26:24.142 --> 01:26:25.185
Shit.

01:26:26.228 --> 01:26:27.437
Good luck.

01:26:30.524 --> 01:26:31.608
What do we do?

01:26:31.692 --> 01:26:32.901
Why have we stopped?

01:26:32.985 --> 01:26:34.444
- No, keep going.
- I wanna go home.

01:26:34.528 --> 01:26:37.489
Okay. Everyone, we just need
to stay quiet and calm, please.

01:26:37.573 --> 01:26:40.075
And Kevin and I, we'll figure this out.

01:26:40.158 --> 01:26:41.660
We need to keep moving.

01:26:41.743 --> 01:26:44.371
Okay. I'm gonna go have a look.
Check this ridge and this ridge.

01:26:44.955 --> 01:26:47.332
Get the kids ready in case
we have to take them off the bus, okay?

01:26:47.416 --> 01:26:48.417
Okay.

01:26:49.793 --> 01:26:51.795
Kevin, what are you doing? Don't go.

01:26:54.923 --> 01:26:56.466
Okay.

01:26:57.593 --> 01:27:00.220
Okay. Kids, this is what
I need for us to do.

01:27:00.304 --> 01:27:03.473
I need us to stay quiet.
I need us to stay calm.

01:27:04.057 --> 01:27:07.311
Kevin is going to check
if it's okay for us to get off the bus.

01:27:07.394 --> 01:27:08.562
In the meantime,

01:27:08.645 --> 01:27:11.273
I want you to grab your backpack
and make a line in the aisle.

01:27:11.356 --> 01:27:14.985
Slowly, quietly,
as calmly as you can, please.

01:27:43.931 --> 01:27:45.015
Come on.

01:28:17.256 --> 01:28:20.217
Okay. As soon as Kevin gets back,
we're gonna file off, okay?

01:28:20.300 --> 01:28:21.301
Yes, ma'am.

01:28:21.385 --> 01:28:22.594
We're gonna stay really close.

01:28:22.678 --> 01:28:25.681
You're gonna find someone's hand
to hold, okay?

01:28:26.431 --> 01:28:27.850
Stay really, really close.

01:28:29.142 --> 01:28:30.477
Look. Kevin, he's back.

01:28:30.561 --> 01:28:31.687
There he is.

01:28:32.396 --> 01:28:34.439
Get the kids. Seat the kids.

01:28:34.523 --> 01:28:35.774
- We're staying on the bus.
- Okay.

01:28:35.858 --> 01:28:37.568
- Staying on the bus.
- Okay. Everybody, sit down.

01:28:37.651 --> 01:28:39.778
- Wait. What?
- Everybody, sit.

01:28:39.862 --> 01:28:41.780
Miss Mary,
I thought you said we were gonna go.

01:28:41.864 --> 01:28:44.199
I did, honey.
But we're gonna stay on the bus.

01:28:44.283 --> 01:28:45.701
Henry, you're…

01:28:45.784 --> 01:28:48.954
Take a seat. We're gonna…
Kevin and I are gonna figure out what…

01:28:49.037 --> 01:28:50.998
- What happened?
- We're surrounded.

01:28:51.081 --> 01:28:53.166
- Oh, my God.
- There's nowhere to go.

01:28:53.250 --> 01:28:57.421
What? No.
That's impossible. It's impossible.

01:28:57.504 --> 01:28:59.673
- There's gotta be a way out.
- Listen to me.

01:28:59.756 --> 01:29:02.593
- We're here on Roe.
- Okay.

01:29:02.676 --> 01:29:03.969
- This is Neal.
- Okay.

01:29:04.052 --> 01:29:05.804
I saw it all from the ridge, okay?

01:29:05.888 --> 01:29:10.726
The fire's on all sides.
It's here, it's here, here and here.

01:29:10.809 --> 01:29:13.395
- Oh, my God.
- We gotta stay here.

01:29:13.478 --> 01:29:15.981
We gotta stay on the bus.

01:29:16.481 --> 01:29:17.733
We're gonna stay on the bus.

01:29:18.317 --> 01:29:19.359
No.

01:29:19.443 --> 01:29:21.778
- No. We…
- We're gonna stay on the bus.

01:29:21.862 --> 01:29:24.573
No. We… No. We could go out on foot.

01:29:24.656 --> 01:29:25.949
Those other people, they went out on foot.

01:29:26.033 --> 01:29:27.618
- We could try on foot.
- No. No way.

01:29:29.161 --> 01:29:31.622
They won't last two minutes out there.
There's no way.

01:29:32.206 --> 01:29:34.333
They won't last two minutes.

01:29:36.585 --> 01:29:37.586
Gotta stay.

01:29:38.712 --> 01:29:40.964
What, we stay here?

01:29:41.048 --> 01:29:42.132
We just…

01:29:42.216 --> 01:29:46.386
What do you…
We're just gonna wait? What do…

01:29:46.470 --> 01:29:49.056
- Maybe the fire doesn't…
- What if the fire comes, but we--

01:29:49.139 --> 01:29:51.350
Maybe it does
or maybe it doesn't come, okay?

01:29:51.433 --> 01:29:52.476
I don't know.

01:29:52.559 --> 01:29:55.145
All I do know is we are in
the one place where the fire is not.

01:29:56.188 --> 01:29:58.774
And we're alive right now.
And we got a little bit of time.

01:30:00.192 --> 01:30:01.193
Stay.

01:30:01.944 --> 01:30:02.945
That's our only chance.

01:30:03.028 --> 01:30:04.029
Are you sure?

01:30:04.112 --> 01:30:05.113
Yes.

01:30:12.079 --> 01:30:13.830
But what if the fire comes?

01:30:14.456 --> 01:30:16.208
What if the fire comes, Kevin?

01:30:18.919 --> 01:30:19.962
Listen to me.

01:30:23.131 --> 01:30:26.134
What do we do with the kids
if the fire comes?

01:30:28.387 --> 01:30:29.680
We gotta stay on the bus.

01:30:30.222 --> 01:30:31.223
Okay.

01:30:34.226 --> 01:30:35.644
- Okay?
- Okay.

01:30:37.521 --> 01:30:38.605
Okay.

01:30:39.106 --> 01:30:41.191
We'll stay on the bus.

01:30:42.234 --> 01:30:43.485
We'll stay on the bus.

01:31:31.783 --> 01:31:35.078
Mary, hey. I need your help.

01:31:35.996 --> 01:31:37.331
We gotta buy some time.

01:31:38.707 --> 01:31:43.295
I'm gonna cut my shirt up
into small pieces. All right?

01:31:46.131 --> 01:31:47.132
What are you doing?

01:31:47.216 --> 01:31:50.427
I'm gonna make some filters
for their mouths.

01:31:50.511 --> 01:31:53.222
Wet them with some water.
It can soothe their throats.

01:31:53.305 --> 01:31:56.350
Let's move the kids to the back of the bus
away from the air vents.

01:31:56.433 --> 01:31:59.019
I'm gonna tape as many vents
as I can, okay?

01:31:59.102 --> 01:32:00.103
Okay.

01:32:01.146 --> 01:32:03.273
Chief, the water supply is failing.

01:32:03.357 --> 01:32:05.359
We've got no pressure in the hydrants.

01:32:06.485 --> 01:32:07.694
We are losing this thing.

01:32:11.532 --> 01:32:13.450
Can I talk to you over here for a second?

01:32:14.785 --> 01:32:16.245
So we're gonna rest for a little bit,

01:32:16.328 --> 01:32:18.121
and I wanna move you
to the back of the bus

01:32:18.205 --> 01:32:19.873
so that you're further away
from the smoke, okay?

01:32:19.957 --> 01:32:20.791
Okay, Miss Mary.

01:32:20.874 --> 01:32:23.752
Honey, can we move
to the back of the bus, all right?

01:32:24.253 --> 01:32:25.254
Come on, this way.

01:32:27.840 --> 01:32:30.300
That should help to keep
some of the smoke out, okay?

01:32:31.134 --> 01:32:34.638
So we're getting reports
of people burning to death in their cars.

01:32:35.264 --> 01:32:38.267
And we've got hundreds of people
running for their lives on foot.

01:32:40.644 --> 01:32:43.188
Okay, girls.
We're gonna be here for a little while.

01:32:43.772 --> 01:32:46.525
I want you to take this filter,

01:32:47.067 --> 01:32:49.987
put it over your mouth
and your nose and breathe, okay?

01:32:50.070 --> 01:32:52.865
If we don't play this right,
we're gonna wake up in the morning

01:32:52.948 --> 01:32:56.618
to hundreds or, I don't know,
even thousands of fatalities.

01:32:57.411 --> 01:32:59.913
Okay? So at this point,
we can do one thing.

01:33:00.497 --> 01:33:03.166
We can fight fire or save lives.

01:33:03.667 --> 01:33:04.751
We are out of time.

01:33:04.835 --> 01:33:07.796
I want you to put it over your mouth
and your nose and breathe.

01:33:07.880 --> 01:33:10.048
- It's gonna help with the smoke, okay?
- Okay.

01:33:10.132 --> 01:33:12.885
- Yeah? How are you doing, sweetie?
- How long are we staying here?

01:33:14.636 --> 01:33:16.471
Thank you for taking care of her, sweetie.

01:33:18.557 --> 01:33:20.517
Ava, I want you
to put this over your mouth.

01:33:20.601 --> 01:33:21.768
Okay, listen up.

01:33:23.896 --> 01:33:25.147
Cease all firefighting.

01:33:25.981 --> 01:33:27.733
Get with your resources inside town

01:33:27.816 --> 01:33:29.693
and tell them to save lives
wherever they can.

01:33:30.652 --> 01:33:31.778
That's all we can do now.

01:33:32.279 --> 01:33:33.280
Copy that, Chief.

01:33:40.996 --> 01:33:42.331
Hurry up.

01:34:16.698 --> 01:34:18.450
The windows are so hot.

01:34:22.579 --> 01:34:24.540
- I have to warn the kids.
- No, I can do it.

01:34:24.623 --> 01:34:27.042
- No. I can… I'm good. I can do it.
- I know you can.

01:34:28.126 --> 01:34:29.837
Rest for a second. I can do it.

01:34:29.920 --> 01:34:31.505
Okay. Thank you.

01:34:36.218 --> 01:34:37.219
Hey, guys.

01:34:37.845 --> 01:34:40.264
The walls and the windows
are really hot, so don't touch them.

01:34:40.347 --> 01:34:42.391
Okay? I want you to come…
lean towards the aisle.

01:34:42.975 --> 01:34:45.435
Here we go.
Can you come this way a little bit?

01:34:45.519 --> 01:34:47.104
The floor's really hot too.

01:34:48.689 --> 01:34:50.148
Let's do the…

01:34:51.233 --> 01:34:52.693
What do you do at story time?

01:34:52.776 --> 01:34:56.280
Let's go crisscross? Apple sauce?

01:34:56.864 --> 01:34:57.865
Say it with me.

01:34:57.948 --> 01:35:00.075
- Crisscross apple sauce.
- Crisscross.

01:35:00.158 --> 01:35:03.704
That's it. Good. Good job, buddy. Okay.

01:35:03.787 --> 01:35:04.872
Is it nighttime?

01:35:06.081 --> 01:35:07.082
What's that, sweetie?

01:35:08.083 --> 01:35:09.543
Is it nighttime?

01:35:09.626 --> 01:35:11.503
No. It's not nighttime.

01:35:12.087 --> 01:35:15.215
It's just… It's smoke.
It's in between us and the sunshine. Okay?

01:35:15.299 --> 01:35:17.176
Are we gonna be okay?

01:35:18.010 --> 01:35:21.346
Yeah. We are gonna be… Yes, we are.

01:35:21.430 --> 01:35:24.099
And that smoke's gonna go away,
and the sun's gonna come back out.

01:35:24.183 --> 01:35:25.184
Okay?

01:35:25.934 --> 01:35:28.353
Toby, you okay?

01:35:28.437 --> 01:35:29.605
I want my daddy.

01:35:36.528 --> 01:35:37.529
Yeah.

01:35:39.865 --> 01:35:41.074
Yeah, I know you do.

01:35:44.077 --> 01:35:46.496
He knows you do too. Okay?

01:35:48.707 --> 01:35:49.958
Listen.

01:35:51.126 --> 01:35:56.048
He's doing everything
he can to get to you.

01:35:56.131 --> 01:35:57.966
Okay? And he's trying his best.

01:35:59.134 --> 01:36:01.553
Okay? Toby, look at me.

01:36:04.640 --> 01:36:05.641
Okay?

01:36:16.360 --> 01:36:18.028
How much time do we have?

01:36:20.322 --> 01:36:21.823
Another hour maybe.

01:36:22.950 --> 01:36:24.952
Those filters won't last much longer.

01:36:25.911 --> 01:36:28.914
Maybe we should just let them go to sleep.

01:36:32.459 --> 01:36:33.585
It's better.

01:36:34.419 --> 01:36:36.255
Then if the fire comes…

01:36:36.338 --> 01:36:38.507
No. No. No.

01:36:39.174 --> 01:36:42.177
We can't let ourselves
talk like that. Okay?

01:36:44.555 --> 01:36:45.556
Okay.

01:37:09.246 --> 01:37:11.582
Good afternoon. I'm Chief Martinez.

01:37:12.708 --> 01:37:14.710
At approximately 6:30 a.m. this morning,

01:37:14.793 --> 01:37:18.797
a fire was reported near the Pulga Bridge,
eight miles east of Paradise.

01:37:20.757 --> 01:37:22.342
The fire spread rapidly,

01:37:22.426 --> 01:37:24.845
overwhelming our best efforts
to contain it.

01:37:24.928 --> 01:37:26.930
And at approximately 8:30 a.m.
this morning,

01:37:27.014 --> 01:37:29.933
the fire entered the town of Paradise.

01:37:31.143 --> 01:37:33.437
Unfortunately, moments ago,
I was forced to give the order

01:37:33.520 --> 01:37:37.691
to cease firefighting in Paradise
and focus solely on protecting life.

01:37:39.735 --> 01:37:42.946
Right now, there's still thousands
of residents trapped

01:37:43.030 --> 01:37:44.781
or attempting to flee the fire.

01:37:46.491 --> 01:37:51.830
And while we are doing everything
we humanly can to assist them…

01:37:53.957 --> 01:37:55.375
despite our best efforts,

01:37:56.084 --> 01:37:59.588
this community is facing
the full force of the fire alone.

01:38:05.093 --> 01:38:09.097
So we ask for your patience,

01:38:10.766 --> 01:38:14.436
and I'll hand it over to Sheriff Thomas,
who may have more information for you.

01:38:15.687 --> 01:38:17.439
We have to get back to work. Thank you.

01:38:19.399 --> 01:38:22.569
I just wanna add one thing.

01:38:24.196 --> 01:38:26.198
Every year the fires get bigger.

01:38:26.281 --> 01:38:27.699
And there's more of them.

01:38:32.829 --> 01:38:35.499
We're being damn fools.
That's the truth. Thank you.

01:38:43.841 --> 01:38:46.009
This is gonna sound silly to you…

01:38:48.804 --> 01:38:53.642
but I've only ever left Paradise one time.

01:38:56.603 --> 01:38:57.813
How's that?

01:38:57.896 --> 01:38:59.231
To go to Ohio.

01:39:01.859 --> 01:39:03.193
Two weeks.

01:39:04.361 --> 01:39:05.904
On my friend's farm.

01:39:08.991 --> 01:39:12.744
And one time, Steven and I
did a weekend in San Francisco.

01:39:14.162 --> 01:39:17.749
I thought that I'd be safe here.

01:39:18.709 --> 01:39:20.377
Just stay in Paradise.

01:39:21.420 --> 01:39:23.839
Stay with him. Follow the rules.

01:39:26.341 --> 01:39:28.260
And nothing bad could truly happen.

01:39:30.470 --> 01:39:32.306
But that's no way to live a life.

01:39:34.099 --> 01:39:35.434
Hiding away.

01:39:37.477 --> 01:39:40.606
That's one thing I'd change
if we get out of here.

01:39:42.274 --> 01:39:43.692
I'd take a trip.

01:39:50.365 --> 01:39:52.576
I'd take Jake to Legoland.

01:39:55.454 --> 01:39:57.748
Or Africa maybe. I don't know.

01:39:59.750 --> 01:40:01.293
I would love to see elephants.

01:40:03.295 --> 01:40:06.798
Animals at a watering hole.

01:40:07.883 --> 01:40:09.885
Anything really. Just anything.

01:40:12.262 --> 01:40:13.722
Before it's too late.

01:40:18.018 --> 01:40:20.604
Why are you laughing?

01:40:24.274 --> 01:40:26.818
I've spent my entire life
trying to escape Paradise,

01:40:26.902 --> 01:40:31.073
and now for some reason
all I wanna do is make a go of it here.

01:40:32.574 --> 01:40:33.951
Why did you wanna leave?

01:40:35.369 --> 01:40:38.121
You know, when I first got
the call to go pick up the kids,

01:40:39.122 --> 01:40:41.208
I started to think that maybe…

01:40:44.253 --> 01:40:48.966
maybe I could earn a second chance
if I just got the kids out safe,

01:40:49.049 --> 01:40:50.133
you know?

01:40:51.635 --> 01:40:54.137
Except they don't always
work that way. Second chances.

01:40:55.931 --> 01:40:57.266
Why do you say that?

01:41:01.854 --> 01:41:04.857
The last time I spoke to my dad
was 28 years ago.

01:41:08.569 --> 01:41:11.405
I was 16. It was Christmas Eve. And…

01:41:14.616 --> 01:41:15.701
We got into a fight.

01:41:16.869 --> 01:41:19.872
Something about me
not finishing what I started.

01:41:19.955 --> 01:41:23.375
Same kind of shit,
same fight it always was.

01:41:24.168 --> 01:41:25.502
Anyway, he…

01:41:26.628 --> 01:41:29.131
He came at me, you know,

01:41:29.214 --> 01:41:31.717
like he usually had
and done so many times before.

01:41:31.800 --> 01:41:34.219
And for whatever reason,
on this night, I snapped.

01:41:35.470 --> 01:41:40.475
I went at him screaming
and swinging and next thing I knew,

01:41:40.559 --> 01:41:43.228
I slammed the front door
and cursed his name.

01:41:43.312 --> 01:41:45.063
Told him I never wanted to see him again.

01:41:45.147 --> 01:41:47.149
He then said, "I wish you were dead."

01:41:48.609 --> 01:41:50.611
First, it was pride, you know?

01:41:52.446 --> 01:41:57.451
Then after a few years,
my life went to shit.

01:41:59.870 --> 01:42:01.079
Turned to shame.

01:42:02.915 --> 01:42:06.668
A few months ago, I was working
the night shift back in Reno.

01:42:08.670 --> 01:42:10.255
And that's when I got the call.

01:42:11.840 --> 01:42:13.175
It was my mom.

01:42:13.258 --> 01:42:15.385
She said, "You know, Kevin,
your dad's real sick.

01:42:15.469 --> 01:42:16.553
You need to come home."

01:42:18.055 --> 01:42:19.139
Drove all night.

01:42:21.016 --> 01:42:22.142
But I was too late.

01:42:24.603 --> 01:42:26.021
He died that morning.

01:42:28.190 --> 01:42:31.360
I was too late… as a son.

01:42:33.820 --> 01:42:35.572
Now I'm too late as a father.

01:42:40.869 --> 01:42:43.247
How many times my son's reached out to me?

01:42:49.503 --> 01:42:50.587
And now it's too late.

01:42:51.880 --> 01:42:52.965
I didn't show up.

01:43:02.850 --> 01:43:04.059
It's not too late.

01:43:07.104 --> 01:43:08.272
It's up to you.

01:43:12.317 --> 01:43:13.527
Fire!

01:43:16.780 --> 01:43:17.948
Oh, shit.

01:43:18.031 --> 01:43:19.157
There's fire.

01:43:26.290 --> 01:43:28.125
Oh, my God.

01:43:31.879 --> 01:43:33.338
- Behind us.
- Fire in the back.

01:43:33.422 --> 01:43:34.882
There's fire in the back.
I'll be right back.

01:43:34.965 --> 01:43:36.592
Kevin!

01:43:36.675 --> 01:43:41.346
Kevin, it's in the back.
It's in the back of the bus.

01:43:41.430 --> 01:43:43.432
- There's fire.
- Here. Go, go. Okay.

01:43:43.515 --> 01:43:44.558
Oh, God.

01:43:53.233 --> 01:43:54.484
Miss Mary!

01:44:01.909 --> 01:44:02.743
Where?

01:44:02.826 --> 01:44:04.620
Here.

01:44:09.583 --> 01:44:10.959
Shit!

01:44:11.043 --> 01:44:12.878
It's out!

01:44:12.961 --> 01:44:14.796
It's out.

01:44:17.925 --> 01:44:19.885
Kevin, we're out.

01:44:19.968 --> 01:44:21.386
We're out. It's out.

01:44:22.846 --> 01:44:24.890
- The spray.
- Go back to the bus.

01:44:24.973 --> 01:44:27.059
Go back to the bus!

01:44:27.142 --> 01:44:28.644
Where are you going?

01:44:28.727 --> 01:44:31.396
No! Kevin!

01:44:33.941 --> 01:44:34.942
Shit.

01:44:37.569 --> 01:44:38.737
Okay.

01:44:40.822 --> 01:44:43.450
Look for fires.

01:44:48.789 --> 01:44:50.040
Kevin!

01:44:58.382 --> 01:45:00.926
Oh, my God.

01:45:01.677 --> 01:45:03.262
Kevin!

01:45:18.235 --> 01:45:19.778
Kevin!

01:45:23.740 --> 01:45:25.200
Come on!

01:45:27.744 --> 01:45:28.912
It's behind us.

01:45:28.996 --> 01:45:30.998
We gotta drive through it.

01:45:31.081 --> 01:45:32.416
Sit down!

01:45:33.917 --> 01:45:35.085
What's wrong?

01:45:35.169 --> 01:45:36.628
- No.
- Come on.

01:45:36.712 --> 01:45:39.214
- No.
- Come on!

01:45:40.424 --> 01:45:42.843
What? No!

01:45:45.721 --> 01:45:46.763
Take the wheel.

01:45:46.847 --> 01:45:49.183
- Kevin, don't go.
- Come back.

01:45:58.442 --> 01:45:59.985
What's Kevin doing?

01:46:06.033 --> 01:46:07.618
Try! Try now!

01:46:09.453 --> 01:46:10.621
Goddamn it!

01:46:16.627 --> 01:46:19.046
Please, please, please.

01:46:25.928 --> 01:46:27.763
Try it! Try now!

01:46:28.347 --> 01:46:29.848
Yes!

01:46:29.932 --> 01:46:31.600
Okay!

01:46:37.606 --> 01:46:39.525
Go!

01:46:45.113 --> 01:46:47.366
Get down. We're going through the fire.

01:47:48.427 --> 01:47:49.678
Oh, God.

01:48:40.812 --> 01:48:42.397
I don't wanna die!

01:49:35.117 --> 01:49:37.119
Miss Mary, is it over?

01:49:39.329 --> 01:49:40.372
Oh, God.

01:49:57.848 --> 01:49:59.433
It's okay.

01:50:04.897 --> 01:50:07.900
Okay. We're okay.

01:50:51.944 --> 01:50:53.529
Come on through.

01:50:55.280 --> 01:50:58.116
This way! Come on!

01:50:59.868 --> 01:51:01.286
Come on through. Follow them.

01:51:07.251 --> 01:51:08.752
Oh, my God.

01:51:08.836 --> 01:51:10.003
Is that the bus?

01:51:11.129 --> 01:51:12.881
It's them.

01:51:12.965 --> 01:51:15.509
Oh, my God.

01:51:16.552 --> 01:51:17.553
Mom.

01:51:41.285 --> 01:51:42.286
Hi!

01:51:44.246 --> 01:51:46.164
What are you waiting for? Let's go.

01:52:06.310 --> 01:52:07.311
Dad!

01:52:07.936 --> 01:52:09.104
Come on, Toby.

01:52:11.982 --> 01:52:13.817
Here's your dad. Right here.

01:52:15.694 --> 01:52:22.451
Thirteen, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.

01:52:24.161 --> 01:52:25.245
Toby.

01:52:26.496 --> 01:52:27.497
Good luck, buddy.

01:52:32.669 --> 01:52:33.754
Your mom's right there.

01:52:33.837 --> 01:52:34.963
Toby!

01:52:40.177 --> 01:52:41.261
All right.

01:52:44.181 --> 01:52:46.183
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:52:47.142 --> 01:52:49.144
You did good. You did really good.

01:52:49.645 --> 01:52:50.646
You did too.

01:52:57.277 --> 01:52:59.029
Send me a picture of those elephants, huh?

01:53:10.040 --> 01:53:11.208
Mary!

01:53:12.501 --> 01:53:17.506
No. Your children are amazing.
They were so brave.

01:53:18.215 --> 01:53:19.424
Thank you, Mary.

01:53:19.508 --> 01:53:21.718
Kevin.

01:53:21.802 --> 01:53:23.846
- Thank you, Kevin.
- Thank you.

01:53:29.977 --> 01:53:31.144
Excuse me.

01:53:37.943 --> 01:53:40.028
I didn't know if you got my call.

01:53:56.503 --> 01:53:58.172
- You okay?
- Yeah.

01:54:15.314 --> 01:54:16.398
Hey, boss.

01:54:19.985 --> 01:54:21.153
Time for maintenance.

01:54:22.154 --> 01:54:25.365
Yeah. I probably owe you
a little overtime too, you know?

01:54:29.578 --> 01:54:30.579
All right, now.

01:54:33.290 --> 01:54:35.000
- Kevin.
- Hey, sir. Hey, how are you?

01:54:35.083 --> 01:54:36.376
Good job.

01:54:36.460 --> 01:54:37.628
All right. Thank you, man.

01:55:05.531 --> 01:55:07.282
Sir, I'm sorry…

01:55:07.366 --> 01:55:09.952
I'm sorry.
I've got to help the next one, sir.

01:55:10.035 --> 01:55:11.453
Ma'am, come up here, please.

01:55:12.329 --> 01:55:15.332
Ma'am, what is the name
you're looking for?

01:55:15.415 --> 01:55:17.125
- Miller.
- Miller.

01:55:17.209 --> 01:55:19.127
Ma'am, there is a Miller.

01:55:19.211 --> 01:55:21.964
- Go to the disaster relief tent…
- Where's that?

01:55:22.047 --> 01:55:23.966
…and look for your family, okay?

01:55:24.049 --> 01:55:25.551
- They're over there.
- Excuse me.

01:55:26.051 --> 01:55:27.886
- Hi, there. McKay.
- What name?

01:55:27.970 --> 01:55:29.555
M-C-K-A-Y.

01:55:29.638 --> 01:55:31.890
- All right.
- Gonna be a Sherry and Shaun.

01:55:33.267 --> 01:55:35.394
They would've come in from Magalia.

01:55:36.603 --> 01:55:39.022
Sir, I'm sorry. I don't see that name.

01:55:42.192 --> 01:55:43.694
We'll keep an eye out for them.

01:55:45.070 --> 01:55:46.280
Thank you.

01:55:46.363 --> 01:55:47.406
Hi, there.

01:56:32.826 --> 01:56:33.827
Ma?

01:56:34.870 --> 01:56:35.871
Ma.

01:56:35.954 --> 01:56:38.207
Hey. You made it.

01:56:38.290 --> 01:56:39.917
How'd you get out?

01:56:40.667 --> 01:56:41.877
- My neighbor, Carl…
- Carl.

01:56:41.960 --> 01:56:43.670
- …he came and got me…
- Carl got you?

01:56:43.754 --> 01:56:46.507
…and brought me here. Yes.

01:56:46.590 --> 01:56:48.842
Listen, Ma. Where's Shaun?

01:56:51.094 --> 01:56:52.179
Where's Shaun, Ma?

01:56:54.598 --> 01:56:55.849
He's with his mother.

01:56:57.309 --> 01:56:59.561
He's happiest when he's with her.

01:57:02.856 --> 01:57:03.941
He's safe.

01:57:06.944 --> 01:57:09.530
It's for the best. Okay?

01:57:16.411 --> 01:57:17.454
Yeah.

01:57:18.997 --> 01:57:19.998
It is.
