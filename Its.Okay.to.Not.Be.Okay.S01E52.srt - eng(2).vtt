WEBVTT

00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:02.919
That's for you.

00:00:03.002 --> 00:00:05.088
- Mmm!
- So good!

00:00:05.505 --> 00:00:06.297
So good.

00:00:06.381 --> 00:00:07.632
Hi, Matmat.

00:00:07.716 --> 00:00:09.509
I'm not paying for what she ate.

00:00:09.592 --> 00:00:11.970
I want an older brother like you!

00:00:12.053 --> 00:00:13.471
Mia, let's go.

00:00:13.555 --> 00:00:14.848
"Face your fears."

00:00:14.931 --> 00:00:16.850
That's what you should be doing

00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:18.768
That way Patrick, will stop being affected

00:00:18.852 --> 00:00:20.729
because of your fear of butterflies.

00:00:20.812 --> 00:00:22.522
And among all my books,

00:00:22.605 --> 00:00:24.441
I really want this one
to be published the most.

00:00:24.524 --> 00:00:27.736
Because it's inspired by the three of us
you, Matmat, and me.

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:29.696
Do it because the story is beautiful.

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:30.947
And not because of us.

00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:32.866
Our story is beautiful.

00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:34.659
Period.

00:01:35.887 --> 00:01:39.307
{\an8}♪ Have you ever been
A little afraid of love ♪

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.603
{\an8}

00:01:47.482 --> 00:01:49.359
{\an8}I hate kids.

00:01:52.028 --> 00:01:54.781
{\an8}Most of those who buy your books are kids.

00:01:55.281 --> 00:01:56.658
{\an8}So, why do you hate them?

00:01:57.826 --> 00:01:59.410
{\an8}My books are for all.

00:01:59.494 --> 00:02:02.497
{\an8}It just so happens that kids love them.

00:02:04.374 --> 00:02:05.792
{\an8}But why do you hate them?

00:02:06.251 --> 00:02:07.418
{\an8}

00:02:07.961 --> 00:02:10.630
{\an8}They are loud, naughty,
and always complaining.

00:02:11.005 --> 00:02:12.924
{\an8}They'd be like,
"Mommy! Mommy, look at me!"

00:02:13.007 --> 00:02:14.384
{\an8}"Love me! Love me!"

00:02:14.467 --> 00:02:15.760
{\an8}"I need to be loved!"

00:02:15.844 --> 00:02:17.345
{\an8}

00:02:17.428 --> 00:02:19.097
{\an8}I love them.

00:02:20.598 --> 00:02:22.225
{\an8}I love kids.

00:02:23.017 --> 00:02:25.103
{\an8}Even though they are naughty,

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.398
{\an8}your frustration will ease
when they show you affection.

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:32.193
{\an8}That's why it feels
good to take care of them.

00:02:32.277 --> 00:02:34.320
{\an8}It feels good to love them.

00:02:34.404 --> 00:02:38.116
{\an8}

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:39.951
{\an8}I don't want to have kids with you.

00:02:40.827 --> 00:02:41.953
{\an8}Huh?

00:02:43.663 --> 00:02:45.373
{\an8}If that's how you'll
treat our future kids,

00:02:45.915 --> 00:02:48.376
{\an8}I don't want to. I'll just get jealous.

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.211
{\an8}-
So, it's a no.

00:02:51.045 --> 00:02:54.132
{\an8}I'm not going to be
the mother of your kids, Patrick.

00:02:54.591 --> 00:02:55.717
{\an8}Mia?

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.761
{\an8}

00:02:58.845 --> 00:03:01.556
{\an8}Is this your way of convincing me?

00:03:03.892 --> 00:03:05.768
{\an8}Don't you want a little Mia?

00:03:06.603 --> 00:03:08.104
{\an8}

00:03:08.187 --> 00:03:10.148
{\an8}Or a little Patrick?

00:03:10.231 --> 00:03:14.068
{\an8}

00:03:16.696 --> 00:03:18.698
If we were to have kids,

00:03:19.866 --> 00:03:22.076
you wouldn't need to be jealous.

00:03:22.952 --> 00:03:28.166
My heart is big enough
that it can share all my love.

00:03:29.834 --> 00:03:31.502
My love for Matmat,

00:03:32.295 --> 00:03:34.297
for my future kids,

00:03:36.883 --> 00:03:39.552
and for you.

00:03:42.013 --> 00:03:44.057
Mm. It's beautiful, isn't it?

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:54.817
I love you so much, Mommy!

00:03:54.901 --> 00:03:57.028
Aw, you're so sweet, dear!

00:04:00.823 --> 00:04:03.284
I love you so much, Daddy!

00:04:03.368 --> 00:04:04.827
Aw, dear!

00:04:04.911 --> 00:04:06.663
Aww!

00:04:14.712 --> 00:04:16.464
Looks like you need more videos.

00:04:17.507 --> 00:04:20.051
Are you my new manager?

00:04:20.134 --> 00:04:21.886
I just want to help Madeth.

00:04:23.888 --> 00:04:25.848
So she will have more options.

00:04:25.932 --> 00:04:28.643
Besides, this is for you.

00:04:28.726 --> 00:04:33.982
I'll say yes if
you become my new manager.

00:04:35.441 --> 00:04:38.653
Mia, I'm a nurse aide, not a manager.

00:04:40.822 --> 00:04:42.073
Look.

00:04:42.156 --> 00:04:44.284
You still don't have
a video of you writing.

00:04:44.367 --> 00:04:46.661
I might need to get
a video of you writing at your desk.

00:04:47.578 --> 00:04:49.956
But before we go home,
let's go to the grocery store.

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:53.084
We no longer have food in the fridge
since you and Matmat burned it all.

00:04:53.876 --> 00:04:57.255
It's scary when you two get hungry.
You might end up eating me.

00:04:59.716 --> 00:05:01.217
Alright. I'm saying yes.

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.596
- Huh?
- I want to have a kid with you.

00:05:06.806 --> 00:05:08.266
Haven't you moved on from that?

00:05:09.267 --> 00:05:12.562
I just thought that if
my kid takes after you,

00:05:13.563 --> 00:05:14.981
I wouldn't get jealous.

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:18.860
Because I'd have two Patricks' to love me.

00:05:19.527 --> 00:05:20.945
It's a win for me.

00:05:23.323 --> 00:05:24.907
Come on, let's go home.

00:05:25.366 --> 00:05:27.243
Hey. I said yes.

00:05:27.327 --> 00:05:30.163
Patrick. I said I want a little Patrick.

00:05:30.246 --> 00:05:33.624
Patrick! Patrick, let's have a baby!

00:05:38.421 --> 00:05:42.008
You're too loud. It's embarrassing.

00:05:44.385 --> 00:05:47.305
I'll update
you once the plane lands.

00:05:47.388 --> 00:05:51.225
And I'll message you every
day so you won't feel like I left.

00:05:53.436 --> 00:05:55.438
So, he just said that?

00:05:55.772 --> 00:05:57.482
But he won't actually do it?

00:05:59.567 --> 00:06:02.236
Lucky you, getting a
second chance at a love life.

00:06:02.695 --> 00:06:05.073
Doc, good thing you and
your ex-girlfriend got back together!

00:06:05.156 --> 00:06:06.574
You're so lucky.

00:06:06.657 --> 00:06:08.451
She's no longer my ex.

00:06:08.534 --> 00:06:10.078
'Cause she's my girlfriend again.

00:06:10.703 --> 00:06:12.538
Okay. Okay.

00:06:12.622 --> 00:06:14.332
Good thing she came back to you.

00:06:14.415 --> 00:06:15.666
Because if it was me, Doc,

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:19.462
our breakup would be the last time
we'd ever see each other.

00:06:23.299 --> 00:06:26.302
Yeah, Doc. Why did you two break up?

00:06:26.385 --> 00:06:28.554
I was so busy with medical school then,

00:06:28.638 --> 00:06:31.474
and she was busy with her business.

00:06:32.683 --> 00:06:36.437
There was no cheating involved.
We broke up on good terms.

00:06:36.521 --> 00:06:38.898
We just didn't have
much time for each other.

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:44.362
You two were okay and on good terms?

00:06:44.445 --> 00:06:45.696
Mm!

00:06:47.156 --> 00:06:49.826
They broke up two years ago!

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:51.828
But even though they've broken up,

00:06:51.911 --> 00:06:54.956
they are still on good terms!

00:06:55.039 --> 00:06:59.293
Because Miss Erica is so kind!

00:06:59.377 --> 00:07:00.711
She's really kind.

00:07:00.795 --> 00:07:04.132
Miss Li, Miss Erica is also sweet!

00:07:04.215 --> 00:07:06.634
- Oh, sweet!
- She's so sweet!

00:07:06.717 --> 00:07:08.136
That must be so sweet, Doc.

00:07:08.719 --> 00:07:10.680
As they say,

00:07:10.763 --> 00:07:14.851
love is sweeter
the second time around. Right, Doc?

00:07:15.393 --> 00:07:17.186
Uh, meaning?

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:19.772
You still loved her
even when you two parted ways?

00:07:20.898 --> 00:07:24.610
For me, I never stopped loving her.

00:07:24.694 --> 00:07:26.320
She was my first love.

00:07:29.073 --> 00:07:32.410
Dear, it's not easy
to move on from your first love.

00:07:32.493 --> 00:07:34.454
That's where we get to experience

00:07:34.537 --> 00:07:37.874
how sweet or painful love is.

00:08:00.396 --> 00:08:01.606
Mmm.

00:08:07.945 --> 00:08:09.489
Mia.

00:08:09.572 --> 00:08:12.658
You said we'd talk
again when we got home.

00:08:13.576 --> 00:08:15.786
Yes. But I didn't say we needed to hug.

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:17.872
You didn't say we couldn't do it.

00:08:17.955 --> 00:08:19.290
Patpat?

00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:21.042
Patpat!

00:08:21.125 --> 00:08:23.127
Matmat is home!

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:25.755
Mia, Matmat is home.

00:08:25.838 --> 00:08:29.884
I'm not letting you go
until you agree to talk in my room later.

00:08:29.967 --> 00:08:32.136
Mm? Patpat!

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:33.804
M-Mia!

00:08:33.888 --> 00:08:35.389
Mia, come on, let go of me.

00:08:35.473 --> 00:08:37.892
Matmat! We're in here!

00:08:37.975 --> 00:08:39.185
Mia!

00:08:39.268 --> 00:08:41.020
Where?

00:08:42.563 --> 00:08:45.274
- Mia, stop.
- Where is Patpat, Mia?

00:08:45.358 --> 00:08:48.236
- Mia, please!
- We'll talk in my room later.

00:08:48.319 --> 00:08:50.863
We'll have wine, cheese, and more.

00:08:50.947 --> 00:08:52.448
Please let me go.

00:08:52.532 --> 00:08:54.408
We're here, Matmat--

00:08:54.492 --> 00:08:57.245
- We're in the kitchen!
- Are you with Patpat?

00:08:57.328 --> 00:08:58.913
Yes, he's here!

00:08:58.996 --> 00:09:00.414
Alright! I'm saying yes!

00:09:00.998 --> 00:09:03.042
Say it. Don't be unfair.

00:09:03.125 --> 00:09:04.627
We'll talk in your room later.

00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:06.671
- With?
- With cheese! With wine!

00:09:06.754 --> 00:09:07.797
And?

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:09.465
- And more!
- And more?

00:09:09.549 --> 00:09:10.841
- Come on.
- Aw, little Pat--

00:09:10.925 --> 00:09:12.927
- Patpat.
- I'll take it.

00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:18.266
M-Matmat kept calling your name,
but you weren't responding.

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:20.810
What are you going to do?

00:09:20.893 --> 00:09:23.229
- Uh…
- Are you going to talk?

00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:29.193
Can Matmat join you?

00:09:33.489 --> 00:09:37.326
Matmat, I bought
new art materials for you.

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:41.163
- New coloring materials…
- Wow! Wow!

00:09:45.668 --> 00:09:47.003
Uh, Madeth.

00:09:47.086 --> 00:09:48.546
Are you talking with someone?

00:09:49.338 --> 00:09:50.631
Uh…

00:09:50.715 --> 00:09:52.133
I'm not.

00:09:52.758 --> 00:09:56.095
I'm just watching videos
because I need to finish this

00:09:56.178 --> 00:09:58.681
'A day in the life of a writer' project.

00:09:58.764 --> 00:10:01.726
I see. It's your new
endorsement with Vincent, right?

00:10:01.809 --> 00:10:04.061
Correct! Yes! Exactly.

00:10:04.145 --> 00:10:05.855
Boss V called.

00:10:05.938 --> 00:10:07.898
He said Miss Erica is
already asking for the video.

00:10:07.982 --> 00:10:09.650
I told him I'm still working on it.

00:10:11.068 --> 00:10:12.653
So you've spoken to him?

00:10:14.989 --> 00:10:19.952
Yeah. He was with
Miss Erica when he called.

00:10:21.829 --> 00:10:24.915
He called Madeth
but didn't bother to message me.

00:10:25.708 --> 00:10:27.168
What did you just say, sis?

00:10:27.251 --> 00:10:31.714
Huh? Nothing.
I said that endorsement seems important.

00:10:31.797 --> 00:10:34.759
Vincent even spent
the day with your client.

00:10:34.842 --> 00:10:36.010
So tell me…

00:10:36.093 --> 00:10:37.970
Are you saying that she's missing me?

00:10:38.721 --> 00:10:41.432
She didn't directly say it, Boss V.

00:10:41.515 --> 00:10:44.685
But I just have a gut feeling.

00:10:45.519 --> 00:10:48.564
Madeth, I'm not sure
your gut feeling should be trusted.

00:10:49.857 --> 00:10:53.027
Then why did
you hire me for this job, Boss V?

00:10:54.153 --> 00:10:55.446
Trust me, Boss V.

00:10:55.529 --> 00:10:56.656
Just a little push,

00:10:56.739 --> 00:10:59.950
Gemma will eventually
verbalize that she misses you.

00:11:00.034 --> 00:11:02.453
Sure, sure. I'll call her right now.

00:11:02.536 --> 00:11:05.039
Hey! No, Boss V!

00:11:05.122 --> 00:11:07.667
Don't! Don't call her yet!

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:11.337
Why? What if Gemma is
upset because I haven't text her?

00:11:12.296 --> 00:11:14.131
Oh, Boss V.

00:11:14.215 --> 00:11:18.386
Haven't you heard
of delayed gratification?

00:11:18.469 --> 00:11:21.972
Just wait for my signal.
I'll tell you when it's time.

00:11:22.056 --> 00:11:24.517
So what? You're the boss now?

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:26.519
I'm the one getting orders from you now?

00:11:26.602 --> 00:11:27.561
Vincent.

00:11:29.438 --> 00:11:30.773
Miss Erica?

00:11:31.565 --> 00:11:32.817
Boss V, is that Miss Erica?

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:34.068
- Hi!
- Hi!

00:11:34.151 --> 00:11:36.070
- Hi! Hello!
- Erica!

00:11:37.863 --> 00:11:39.073
Boss V?

00:11:39.448 --> 00:11:42.284
Oh, sorry. I got a little excited.

00:11:42.368 --> 00:11:44.870
Really? We've been
talking on the phone for a while.

00:11:44.954 --> 00:11:48.249
No, but it's different
seeing you in person.

00:11:48.332 --> 00:11:50.251
Oh, yeah. Um…

00:11:51.001 --> 00:11:52.378
- Let's have a seat.
- Yeah.

00:11:52.461 --> 00:11:53.546
Uh, Miss!

00:11:53.629 --> 00:11:54.755
Good to see you. How are you?

00:11:54.839 --> 00:11:57.425
I'm good. I'm good and
I'm happy to see you as well.

00:11:57.508 --> 00:11:59.218
Uh, yes. We'll order, please.

00:11:59.301 --> 00:12:01.429
Okay. Uh…

00:12:03.222 --> 00:12:04.348
Patpat,

00:12:04.432 --> 00:12:06.934
Dr. Anok said

00:12:07.601 --> 00:12:14.692
in different countries
the butterfly is a cure.

00:12:17.319 --> 00:12:18.487
Cure…

00:12:18.571 --> 00:12:22.116
What does that mean?

00:12:23.033 --> 00:12:25.286
Does the illness go away?

00:12:26.036 --> 00:12:27.037
Is it like…

00:12:28.539 --> 00:12:31.834
If you could drink the butterfly

00:12:31.917 --> 00:12:33.127
then you'll be healed.

00:12:35.212 --> 00:12:37.089
It's not a drug, Matmat.

00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:39.508
What doc meant was,

00:12:40.217 --> 00:12:41.719
the butterflies…

00:12:42.887 --> 00:12:44.930
are a symbol of healing.

00:12:45.347 --> 00:12:47.600
Remember, they were caterpillars first

00:12:47.683 --> 00:12:50.019
before they became butterflies.

00:13:02.156 --> 00:13:04.825
They're like dinosaurs.

00:13:04.909 --> 00:13:08.579
They start out as
babies then they grow old.

00:13:10.414 --> 00:13:11.540
Could be.

00:13:15.294 --> 00:13:17.421
Like an Archaeopteryx.

00:13:18.506 --> 00:13:21.842
First bird dinosaur.

00:13:22.718 --> 00:13:27.681
But they're born
with wings already, Patpat.

00:13:30.976 --> 00:13:32.853
What I'm trying to say is,

00:13:33.812 --> 00:13:37.691
the butterflies' wings
and how they fly freely

00:13:38.943 --> 00:13:41.612
symbolize that a person has healed.

00:13:42.154 --> 00:13:43.781
The illness is gone?

00:13:46.784 --> 00:13:48.619
Free from the pain.

00:13:48.702 --> 00:13:51.413
Doc said,

00:13:53.165 --> 00:13:57.294
Patpat is also getting affected because…

00:13:59.255 --> 00:14:01.632
Because Matmat is scared of butterflies.

00:14:03.133 --> 00:14:06.804
Are you scared of butterflies too, Patpat?

00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:10.724
Not really, Matmat.

00:14:12.393 --> 00:14:13.394
But…

00:14:14.812 --> 00:14:16.230
I also have to move places,

00:14:16.605 --> 00:14:19.650
even though I'm not the one
being chased by the butterflies.

00:14:19.733 --> 00:14:25.239
That's why we should face our fears.

00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:31.370
We should face
our fears so we don't have to move.

00:14:37.459 --> 00:14:39.044
Do you think…

00:14:40.129 --> 00:14:41.297
you can do that?

00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:47.344
Do you think you can
face your fear of butterflies?

00:14:54.810 --> 00:14:58.480
We have new bread.

00:14:58.564 --> 00:15:01.901
To replace what Mia burnt.

00:15:15.331 --> 00:15:16.332
Zelda?

00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:21.712
Do you know where you are?

00:15:25.591 --> 00:15:27.134
Isolation room.

00:15:30.471 --> 00:15:32.640
Do you know how you got here?

00:15:33.349 --> 00:15:34.141
Mm-hmm.

00:15:34.725 --> 00:15:36.226
I walked here.

00:15:39.313 --> 00:15:40.940
Did you go to Mia's house?

00:15:44.526 --> 00:15:45.486
Y-Yes.

00:15:47.696 --> 00:15:50.199
I wished her a happy birthday.

00:15:52.326 --> 00:15:54.036
Did she help you to go there?

00:15:56.413 --> 00:15:59.041
No, no. I was alone when I went out.

00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:02.544
And then…

00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:06.799
He thought I was her.

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:10.010
He thought I was her!

00:16:12.554 --> 00:16:13.764
Who?

00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:15.975
Who did they think you were?

00:16:17.059 --> 00:16:18.352
Ingrid.

00:16:19.812 --> 00:16:23.107
He thought I was Ingrid Hernandez.

00:16:23.816 --> 00:16:26.276
I'm not her.

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:28.904
I'm not, I'm not Ingrid.

00:16:30.864 --> 00:16:32.032
Ingrid?

00:16:33.075 --> 00:16:34.326
Mia's mom?

00:16:36.036 --> 00:16:37.955
I'm not her.

00:16:38.038 --> 00:16:40.416
- Do you know who he was?
- No.

00:16:40.499 --> 00:16:42.292
I don't know him.

00:16:43.043 --> 00:16:45.838
His face…

00:16:46.588 --> 00:16:48.298
He was so mad!

00:16:48.382 --> 00:16:50.634
So, so mad!

00:16:50.718 --> 00:16:52.845
He thought I was Ingrid!

00:16:52.928 --> 00:16:55.764
He thought I was Ingrid but that's not me!

00:16:55.848 --> 00:16:57.474
That's not me!

00:16:57.558 --> 00:17:00.519
He wants to kill me! I don't want to die!

00:17:00.602 --> 00:17:04.898
I don't want to die!
I don't want to die!

00:17:04.982 --> 00:17:07.151
Do you think she's telling the truth?

00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:10.446
Do you believe that's
what happened to her?

00:17:11.488 --> 00:17:13.532
That she was mistaken as Mia's mother?

00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:17.369
Okay, calm down.
You're safe, you're safe.

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:22.875
If it's true that someone kidnapped her,

00:17:23.375 --> 00:17:25.335
because they thought she was Ingrid,

00:17:26.503 --> 00:17:29.006
Could Samuel
and Mia be in danger too?

00:17:32.426 --> 00:17:34.053
Are you saying, Doc,

00:17:34.136 --> 00:17:36.346
that there's someone out there

00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:38.891
who is a threat to their lives?

00:17:38.974 --> 00:17:40.225
Not just that.

00:17:40.726 --> 00:17:43.270
What if they're looking for Ingrid

00:17:43.353 --> 00:17:45.105
because she's still alive?

00:17:45.898 --> 00:17:48.609
What if Ingrid is still really alive?

00:17:49.777 --> 00:17:52.988
Then it's going
to change everybody's lives.

00:17:54.114 --> 00:17:57.451
Maybe it'll be better if she comes back.

00:17:58.994 --> 00:18:00.204
Because then…

00:18:01.497 --> 00:18:02.873
there will be no more mystery.

00:18:04.208 --> 00:18:05.751
No more hiding.

00:18:20.641 --> 00:18:22.559
Is it true?

00:18:23.811 --> 00:18:27.272
Are you really going
to return to your family, Ingrid?

00:18:50.629 --> 00:18:51.713
Mia.

00:18:52.923 --> 00:18:54.133
Come in.

00:19:00.556 --> 00:19:02.057
Hello, pretty boy.

00:19:05.394 --> 00:19:06.562
Wine.

00:19:06.645 --> 00:19:07.729
Cheese.

00:19:08.814 --> 00:19:09.898
And more.

00:19:14.236 --> 00:19:16.738
Matmat told me something earlier.

00:19:16.822 --> 00:19:18.991
He and Dr. Anok talked.

00:19:23.912 --> 00:19:25.831
What are you doing?

00:19:25.914 --> 00:19:27.666
Wine and cheese.

00:19:27.749 --> 00:19:29.168
Let's talk.

00:19:30.711 --> 00:19:33.630
Wine, cheese and more.

00:19:33.714 --> 00:19:36.341
Me. I'm the "and more."

00:19:37.342 --> 00:19:38.302
Really?

00:19:42.222 --> 00:19:44.391
You really know how to kill the mood.

00:19:44.933 --> 00:19:47.394
Are we really going to talk about Matmat?

00:19:47.477 --> 00:19:49.396
Well, what are we going to talk about?

00:19:49.479 --> 00:19:50.480
Us.

00:19:50.564 --> 00:19:54.860
There's so much
we can talk about and do.

00:19:54.943 --> 00:19:59.364
So please,
let's not talk about Matmat right now.

00:20:01.658 --> 00:20:04.203
Every time you mention Matmat,

00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:08.832
you have to drink a glass of wine.

00:20:09.541 --> 00:20:10.876
Fine.

00:20:10.959 --> 00:20:12.294
But you drink a glass

00:20:12.377 --> 00:20:16.089
every time you curse
or say something mean.

00:20:17.216 --> 00:20:18.842
That's all?

00:20:18.926 --> 00:20:20.886
Fine. Deal.

00:20:33.315 --> 00:20:36.652
I'm not Gemma,
I shouldn't be this drunk, this fast.

00:20:36.735 --> 00:20:38.570
Don't drag other people into this.

00:20:39.404 --> 00:20:42.950
Your drunk because you drank too much.

00:20:43.033 --> 00:20:47.287
I'm sure you love
that we're talking about her.

00:20:48.997 --> 00:20:52.459
Leave Gemma out of it.
Come here, you're talking too much.

00:20:58.006 --> 00:20:59.883
You really just want attention, huh?

00:21:00.467 --> 00:21:01.468
Mm-hmm.

00:21:03.011 --> 00:21:06.848
I'm so happy, even just like this.

00:21:09.768 --> 00:21:12.896
I'm so, so happy…

00:21:13.647 --> 00:21:17.067
that you and Matmat
are living here with me.

00:21:18.819 --> 00:21:20.445
So happy…

00:21:22.322 --> 00:21:26.034
I'm so very, very happy.

00:21:31.915 --> 00:21:32.958
Me too.

00:21:38.672 --> 00:21:39.673
Good night.

00:22:31.141 --> 00:22:35.312
"I'LL BE BACK"

00:22:35.395 --> 00:22:36.938
She's the only
one who could've put this here.

00:22:55.665 --> 00:22:56.875
Look at this!

00:22:57.334 --> 00:22:59.169
- You did this to yourself!
- Ahh!

00:22:59.252 --> 00:23:01.213
- Hey!

00:23:01.296 --> 00:23:05.300
I've waited for this
moment for a long time.

00:23:05.801 --> 00:23:09.054
- No! I'm not Ingrid!

00:23:10.013 --> 00:23:12.099
- No!
- Shut up!

00:23:12.182 --> 00:23:15.018
Everyone thinks you're dead.

00:23:15.102 --> 00:23:17.771
I'm then only one
who saw you come out of the lake.

00:23:17.854 --> 00:23:20.315
I'm not Ingrid!

00:23:20.398 --> 00:23:22.067
I'm not Ingrid!

00:23:22.150 --> 00:23:27.197
Aah! Aah! Aah!

00:23:30.659 --> 00:23:33.078
Zelda!

00:23:34.913 --> 00:23:37.624
Nurse… Nurse… Nurse…

00:23:37.707 --> 00:23:38.917
Call my brother!

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.712
I'm leaving!
I don't want to stay here anymore!

00:23:42.796 --> 00:23:45.465
Transfer me to another hospital!

00:23:45.549 --> 00:23:49.094
"I'LL BE BACK"

00:24:15.078 --> 00:24:16.246
Miss Zelda!

00:24:17.247 --> 00:24:20.208
Miss Zelda, there's something
I need to ask you, before you leave.

00:24:21.793 --> 00:24:23.461
Patrick, I'm about to leave.

00:24:23.795 --> 00:24:25.380
You went to Mia's mansion, right?

00:24:25.463 --> 00:24:26.965
Were you the one who left the butterfly?

00:24:27.048 --> 00:24:28.425
We need to leave.

00:24:28.508 --> 00:24:31.011
The letter? Was it from you?

00:24:31.094 --> 00:24:33.013
- Yes, I put it there.
- Auntie.

00:24:33.805 --> 00:24:34.764
It's okay.

00:24:37.434 --> 00:24:38.602
You put it there.

00:24:39.644 --> 00:24:40.979
Why did you do that?

00:24:42.272 --> 00:24:43.732
I put it there

00:24:44.357 --> 00:24:46.067
because someone told me to.

00:24:46.651 --> 00:24:47.736
Who?

00:24:50.906 --> 00:24:53.074
I received some letters out of nowhere,

00:24:53.158 --> 00:24:55.160
with instructions
to give them to someone.

00:24:57.370 --> 00:25:00.207
Was it Ingrid Hernandez?

00:25:08.924 --> 00:25:11.551
I'm a fan.

00:25:13.595 --> 00:25:18.016
I'm a big, big fan of Ingrid Hernandez.

00:25:19.893 --> 00:25:21.478
I know everything about her

00:25:21.561 --> 00:25:24.189
because of the stories she wrote.

00:25:25.941 --> 00:25:26.942
So, yes.

00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:30.737
Everything was from Ingrid.

00:25:37.953 --> 00:25:39.829
And she's alive, Patrick.

00:25:41.498 --> 00:25:43.208
She's alive!

00:25:51.591 --> 00:25:54.678
And if there's one thing I know for sure,

00:25:57.472 --> 00:25:59.766
she's here, inside the hospital.

00:26:10.944 --> 00:26:12.153
I have to go.

00:26:36.511 --> 00:26:39.097
What makes a person want to run away?

00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:42.726
What if Matmat gets
chased by the butterflies?

00:26:42.809 --> 00:26:46.229
They continue to face challenges daily.

00:26:46.313 --> 00:26:47.105
Are you still afraid?

00:26:47.188 --> 00:26:48.606
I'm going to fight the butterflies.

00:26:48.690 --> 00:26:51.318
Your brother will fight too.

00:26:51.401 --> 00:26:53.611
Are you ready to tell me what you saw?

00:26:53.695 --> 00:26:54.946
I saw…

00:26:55.030 --> 00:26:58.658
What did you see
the night our mother was murdered?
