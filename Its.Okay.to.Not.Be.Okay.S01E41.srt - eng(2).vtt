00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:04.337
Matmat had a breakdown
recalling of his accident at the river.

00:00:05.255 --> 00:00:07.465
But why do I feel like it's my fault?

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:11.886
Talk to your siblings.
So they can finally come home.

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.515
Is it true his brother
wanted him dead before?

00:00:15.598 --> 00:00:18.143
- Stop gossiping!
- Stop it!

00:00:18.226 --> 00:00:19.602
You don't know him!

00:00:19.686 --> 00:00:22.313
It seems it was just
a simple fight with his brother.

00:00:22.397 --> 00:00:25.316
Don't underestimate
a simple misunderstanding.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:31.740
A simple misunderstanding
could cost someone their life.

00:00:31.823 --> 00:00:34.409
Bro, take a look at your palm.

00:00:34.492 --> 00:00:37.787
It might just remind you
why you shouldn't be with Mia.

00:00:37.871 --> 00:00:40.623
I was just a dream. But I'm awake now.

00:00:40.707 --> 00:00:42.083
I'm back to reality now.

00:01:47.732 --> 00:01:48.900
{\an8}Talk to me.

00:01:48.983 --> 00:01:51.861
{\an8}

00:01:51.945 --> 00:01:54.572
{\an8}You can't just ignore me.

00:01:54.656 --> 00:01:58.660
{\an8}

00:02:00.662 --> 00:02:01.663
{\an8}

00:02:01.746 --> 00:02:02.872
{\an8}

00:02:02.956 --> 00:02:07.794
{\an8}

00:02:14.717 --> 00:02:15.718
{\an8}

00:02:22.058 --> 00:02:24.018
{\an8}

00:02:24.102 --> 00:02:29.440
{\an8}

00:02:29.524 --> 00:02:30.525
{\an8}

00:02:32.485 --> 00:02:33.528
{\an8}-

00:02:33.611 --> 00:02:34.654
{\an8}

00:02:34.737 --> 00:02:36.114
{\an8}Matmat?

00:02:37.991 --> 00:02:40.118
{\an8}

00:02:42.704 --> 00:02:44.414
{\an8}

00:02:44.497 --> 00:02:45.832
{\an8}Oh, no.

00:02:45.915 --> 00:02:48.126
{\an8}I think Matmat is asleep.

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:51.754
{\an8}How will he eat
the chicken barbecue I brought?

00:02:51.838 --> 00:02:53.756
{\an8}-

00:02:55.884 --> 00:02:58.011
{\an8}-

00:02:58.094 --> 00:03:00.179
{\an8}What a shame!

00:03:00.263 --> 00:03:05.560
{\an8}It smells so good.
I cooked it myself at my restaurant.

00:03:05.643 --> 00:03:09.772
{\an8}I even brought hot
soup that Mama Li cooked.

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:13.109
{\an8}Oh, wow!

00:03:13.192 --> 00:03:16.779
{\an8}Well, I guess I should just go.

00:03:16.863 --> 00:03:19.324
{\an8}I need to go back to my restaurant.

00:03:19.407 --> 00:03:25.705
{\an8}What shall I do with these?
Who will eat the barbecue and

00:03:25.788 --> 00:03:27.749
Mama Li's hot soup?

00:03:27.832 --> 00:03:30.460
What do I do? Hmm…

00:03:30.877 --> 00:03:32.211
What do I do?

00:03:32.295 --> 00:03:35.465
I'll just leave
it here on the brown table.

00:03:35.548 --> 00:03:36.841
Right next to Matmat.

00:03:36.925 --> 00:03:38.176
Alright.

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:39.427
I'll be off now.

00:03:58.821 --> 00:04:02.909
Thank you, Mama Li and Jason.

00:04:09.457 --> 00:04:10.792
Hmm?

00:04:15.296 --> 00:04:17.173
Jason?

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:30.353
Jason's not here?

00:04:51.666 --> 00:04:54.335
"KILLING THE ENCHANTED WITCH"

00:05:19.277 --> 00:05:23.072
"The little brother

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.743
killed his big brother."

00:07:22.358 --> 00:07:23.359
Patrick?

00:07:28.489 --> 00:07:31.117
How were you able
to change clothes without coming home?

00:07:32.118 --> 00:07:33.744
What about your undergarments?

00:07:37.874 --> 00:07:38.875
Here.

00:07:39.375 --> 00:07:40.626
I bought it for you.

00:07:41.085 --> 00:07:42.253
It's your size.

00:07:42.628 --> 00:07:44.714
I checked your things at home to be sure.

00:07:45.506 --> 00:07:47.216
It's big…

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:48.551
Mia!

00:07:48.634 --> 00:07:50.178
The closet's big.

00:07:54.015 --> 00:07:55.600
Can we talk now?

00:07:56.392 --> 00:07:57.685
I'm still working.

00:07:57.768 --> 00:08:00.980
I didn't call you yesterday because
you said you were taking care of Matmat.

00:08:01.606 --> 00:08:05.359
Now that you're not
busy with him, can we talk?

00:08:10.573 --> 00:08:12.700
Fine. Let's talk.

00:08:18.831 --> 00:08:20.124
- Here, hold this.
- Okay.

00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:22.043
That's Patrick's.

00:08:22.502 --> 00:08:23.503
Don't touch it.

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:25.421
Okay.

00:08:26.255 --> 00:08:27.340
Okay.

00:08:28.508 --> 00:08:31.344
Hey! Didn't she just say not to touch it?

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:34.597
She knows Patrick's size?

00:08:35.556 --> 00:08:37.475
That's how close they are?

00:08:37.558 --> 00:08:38.768
I told you.

00:08:38.851 --> 00:08:40.144
I told you they're together.

00:08:40.228 --> 00:08:42.355
Tsk! Give me that!

00:08:42.438 --> 00:08:43.606
Patrick.

00:08:44.148 --> 00:08:45.733
Are you mad at me,

00:08:46.359 --> 00:08:49.487
because you didn't tell
Matmat the truth about of our trip?

00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:51.239
I'm not mad.

00:08:51.322 --> 00:08:53.157
Then why aren't you talking to me?

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:57.411
Matmat is all I have time
to worry about right now.

00:08:57.495 --> 00:08:59.080
About your past?

00:08:59.163 --> 00:09:01.958
Because he recalled
how you wanted him dead?

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:03.834
That's not your fault.

00:09:05.253 --> 00:09:07.255
- You're only saying that because--
- No.

00:09:07.922 --> 00:09:10.258
I know it's not your fault.

00:09:11.801 --> 00:09:13.594
Because I saw everything.

00:09:13.678 --> 00:09:15.888
I was there.

00:09:15.972 --> 00:09:17.682
You didn't push him.

00:09:17.765 --> 00:09:20.476
It was an accident,
him falling into the river

00:09:22.395 --> 00:09:25.398
I even wished you'd let him drown.

00:09:27.024 --> 00:09:29.485
But you were a poor little boy,

00:09:29.986 --> 00:09:31.571
who loved his brother.

00:09:32.655 --> 00:09:34.156
You saved him.

00:09:36.325 --> 00:09:37.618
I know that.

00:09:38.244 --> 00:09:40.079
But it doesn't mean
my conscience is clear

00:09:40.162 --> 00:09:41.831
about what happened.

00:09:41.914 --> 00:09:43.040
There you go again.

00:09:44.542 --> 00:09:47.753
Stop playing hostage
and victim to your family.

00:09:48.462 --> 00:09:50.172
You didn't commit a murder.

00:09:50.256 --> 00:09:53.509
It's not your fault
your brother fell into the river.

00:09:56.137 --> 00:09:57.722
See?

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:02.143
I can be the key
to break all of your chains.

00:10:03.811 --> 00:10:05.062
Come with me.

00:10:06.939 --> 00:10:08.316
Live with me.

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:13.863
I can't, Mia.

00:10:14.614 --> 00:10:15.906
Come on, Patrick.

00:10:16.866 --> 00:10:20.578
Even after Matmat admitted
he's been holding a grudge against you,

00:10:20.661 --> 00:10:22.788
do you think he still want to be with you?

00:10:24.999 --> 00:10:26.876
I can't go with you, Mia.

00:10:29.045 --> 00:10:30.379
I don't believe you.

00:10:31.797 --> 00:10:33.841
What you say is
different from what I see.

00:10:33.924 --> 00:10:36.052
Mia, don't twist my words!

00:10:36.135 --> 00:10:38.262
I'm only saying what I see!

00:10:39.347 --> 00:10:41.766
That was just a dream, okay?

00:10:41.849 --> 00:10:43.601
Us swimming in the sea,
that night we spent together,

00:10:43.684 --> 00:10:46.145
everything we shared that morning,
all of that was just a dream!

00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:49.315
Are you hallucinating?

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:52.902
We were really together in Montanesa!

00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:55.571
Yes.

00:10:55.988 --> 00:10:57.406
And now it's just a memory.

00:10:58.407 --> 00:10:59.659
That's all it'll ever be.

00:11:00.618 --> 00:11:02.411
Are you cutting me out of your life

00:11:02.495 --> 00:11:04.830
just to try to make up for
your past with your brother?!

00:11:07.333 --> 00:11:10.252
Mia, we were kids when he almost drowned.

00:11:12.254 --> 00:11:14.215
I didn't know better then.

00:11:14.965 --> 00:11:16.759
I didn't realize I was hurting Matmat.

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:24.100
Now it's my fault…

00:11:27.061 --> 00:11:29.939
because when I'm with you,
it's like he doesn't exist.

00:11:39.031 --> 00:11:41.325
It's wrong that I keep forgetting Matmat.

00:11:43.327 --> 00:11:46.956
It was a mistake that I ever entertained
having you in my life when we met again.

00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:55.714
What about when you said
you were free because of me?

00:11:57.842 --> 00:11:59.135
Was that also a mistake?

00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:07.101
My reality is clearer to me now.

00:12:09.395 --> 00:12:10.729
Stop lying.

00:12:12.064 --> 00:12:14.442
That's why Matmat calls you a liar.

00:12:14.525 --> 00:12:15.693
That's the truth.

00:12:16.819 --> 00:12:17.903
Enough.

00:12:20.072 --> 00:12:21.407
Patrick, please.

00:12:22.992 --> 00:12:24.076
Enough.

00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:26.328
Mia, let's end this.

00:12:29.707 --> 00:12:32.084
Stop holding on to what we had.

00:12:36.464 --> 00:12:37.840
This is where it ends for us.

00:12:42.344 --> 00:12:43.554
Patrick!

00:12:44.555 --> 00:12:45.931
Patrick, come back!

00:12:48.309 --> 00:12:49.351
Patrick!

00:13:53.582 --> 00:13:55.960
That was just a dream, okay?

00:13:56.043 --> 00:13:57.836
Us swimming in the sea,
that night we spent together,

00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:00.381
everything we shared that morning,
all of it was just a dream.

00:14:00.464 --> 00:14:02.716
We were really
together in Montanesa!

00:14:03.259 --> 00:14:04.385
Yes.

00:14:04.843 --> 00:14:06.512
And now it's just a memory.

00:14:07.179 --> 00:14:08.264
That's all it'll ever be.

00:14:24.238 --> 00:14:26.031
Are you cutting me out of your life

00:14:26.115 --> 00:14:28.993
just to make up for
your past with your brother?!

00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:32.746
Mia, we were kids when he almost drowned.

00:14:34.832 --> 00:14:36.417
I didn't know better then.

00:14:37.501 --> 00:14:39.420
I didn't realize I was hurting Matmat.

00:14:48.053 --> 00:14:49.972
Now it's my fault…

00:14:51.015 --> 00:14:54.184
because when I'm with you,
it's like he doesn't exist.

00:14:57.688 --> 00:14:59.607
It's wrong that I keep forgetting Matmat.

00:16:42.334 --> 00:16:43.836
Even after Matmat has admitted

00:16:43.919 --> 00:16:46.338
he's been holding a grudge against you,

00:16:46.422 --> 00:16:48.841
do you think he still
wants to be with you?

00:17:02.187 --> 00:17:03.731
Luis.

00:17:07.651 --> 00:17:09.445
I'm so tired.

00:17:15.784 --> 00:17:17.786
Why did you have to go?

00:17:22.332 --> 00:17:25.919
Why did you leave us so early?

00:17:31.425 --> 00:17:34.595
Luis, your sons need you.

00:17:34.678 --> 00:17:36.889
They really do.

00:17:52.321 --> 00:17:55.282
They're so naughty.

00:18:10.339 --> 00:18:11.465
Ma?

00:18:14.885 --> 00:18:16.512
Patrick.

00:18:16.595 --> 00:18:18.013
Patrick.

00:18:18.097 --> 00:18:19.932
Patrick, my son, come here.

00:18:20.557 --> 00:18:21.517
Come here.

00:18:22.101 --> 00:18:24.311
Aw, Patrick.

00:18:25.145 --> 00:18:27.773
My sweet son.

00:18:33.195 --> 00:18:35.531
Don't leave your brother alone, okay?

00:18:38.492 --> 00:18:40.702
Always take care of him.

00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:43.413
Always stand up for him, okay?

00:18:45.499 --> 00:18:48.127
Take care of him for life.

00:18:51.088 --> 00:18:53.507
Ow!

00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:55.968
Ow! It hurts!

00:18:56.051 --> 00:18:58.846
Patpat! It hurts, Patpat!

00:18:58.929 --> 00:19:01.140
Patpat, it hurts!

00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:05.894
Look at you. You got hurt.

00:19:05.978 --> 00:19:07.604
Yes, Patpat.

00:19:08.313 --> 00:19:12.151
Patpat, you forgot your boxing gloves.

00:19:13.193 --> 00:19:15.404
These are for Patpat.

00:19:15.487 --> 00:19:17.781
This is for Matmat.

00:19:18.323 --> 00:19:19.992
Dino Boy!

00:19:22.786 --> 00:19:25.914
This is mine, and those are yours, right?

00:19:27.124 --> 00:19:30.711
M-Miss Mia or Matmat?

00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:37.176
Of course, it's you, Matmat.

00:19:37.259 --> 00:19:38.635
Liar!

00:19:38.719 --> 00:19:40.596
You're a liar!

00:19:40.679 --> 00:19:44.725
You told Mama you wanted me gone!

00:19:44.808 --> 00:19:47.019
"I hope Matmat just dies!"

00:19:47.936 --> 00:19:52.191
You told Mama you wanted me dead!

00:19:52.941 --> 00:19:55.277
You want me dead!

00:19:55.611 --> 00:19:58.739
I hope he just dies!

00:19:58.822 --> 00:20:00.991
I hope Matmat dies!

00:20:02.784 --> 00:20:04.119
P-Patpat!

00:20:08.707 --> 00:20:11.168
Patpat!

00:20:14.588 --> 00:20:16.048
Patpat!

00:20:18.842 --> 00:20:19.968
Pat--

00:20:21.553 --> 00:20:22.721
Patpat!

00:20:28.393 --> 00:20:29.770
Patpat--

00:20:30.354 --> 00:20:31.521
Matmat!

00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:34.650
Matmat!

00:20:39.947 --> 00:20:41.949
- Matmat.
- Patpat.

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:49.414
Matmat!

00:20:51.416 --> 00:20:53.585
Mama is still alive.

00:20:56.129 --> 00:20:58.131
Mama is in heaven now.

00:20:58.799 --> 00:21:01.635
We can't be with Mama anymore.

00:21:02.594 --> 00:21:04.554
Just like Trexy…

00:21:04.638 --> 00:21:09.601
Trexy's mother left him.

00:21:10.227 --> 00:21:14.022
- But--
- Mama left Matmat.

00:21:14.106 --> 00:21:15.857
- I'm still here, Matmat.
- Mama left him.

00:21:15.941 --> 00:21:17.818
I'm still here for you.

00:21:18.402 --> 00:21:19.695
I'm not leaving you.

00:21:19.778 --> 00:21:21.989
I'll be with you everywhere you go.

00:21:23.323 --> 00:21:25.325
You and me, Patpat?

00:21:26.118 --> 00:21:28.078
Yes, Matmat.

00:21:28.161 --> 00:21:30.789
Matmat and Patpat, right?

00:21:31.748 --> 00:21:33.917
Only Matmat and Patpat?

00:21:41.049 --> 00:21:42.175
Yes.

00:21:44.094 --> 00:21:45.846
Only Matmat and Patpat.

00:21:48.890 --> 00:21:51.268
Don't leave
your brother alone, okay?

00:21:54.521 --> 00:21:56.606
Always take care of him.

00:22:00.277 --> 00:22:02.446
Always stand up for him, okay?

00:22:06.867 --> 00:22:10.120
- Take care of him for life.

00:22:19.087 --> 00:22:20.505
Happy day.

00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:23.550
Happy day.

00:23:01.713 --> 00:23:03.215
You can't resist me.

00:23:03.298 --> 00:23:05.425
We have to end up together.

00:23:07.010 --> 00:23:09.096
Mama Dinosaur is so kind.

00:23:09.179 --> 00:23:11.264
But Bunso is not.

00:23:11.348 --> 00:23:13.517
Whatever you two went through

00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:15.727
is just part of who you are today.

00:23:15.811 --> 00:23:17.896
Think about your
own happiness too.

00:23:17.979 --> 00:23:19.856
That's not being selfish.

00:23:21.316 --> 00:23:23.568
- Where's Mia?
- She's at her house.
