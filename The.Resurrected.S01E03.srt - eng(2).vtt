00:00:38.958 --> 00:00:40.208
Why did you stop?

00:00:40.291 --> 00:00:42.000
See that road back there?

00:00:42.708 --> 00:00:46.583
Head north for 30 minutes down that road
and cross the border.

00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:49.666
That's where Jin Jin
and Hsin-yi were kept.

00:00:51.041 --> 00:00:52.041
How do you know?

00:00:52.125 --> 00:00:53.500
I've been there.

00:00:53.583 --> 00:00:54.750
Five years ago.

00:00:56.875 --> 00:01:00.375
When Jin Jin and the others were rescued?

00:01:00.458 --> 00:01:01.291
Yes.

00:01:03.125 --> 00:01:04.583
What was it like inside?

00:01:05.208 --> 00:01:09.125
Looked like a resort from the outside,
but it was deserted when I got there.

00:01:09.208 --> 00:01:12.291
There were discarded phones
and computers everywhere

00:01:12.375 --> 00:01:15.416
and a stack of unlit fireworks.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:16.500
Fireworks?

00:01:17.416 --> 00:01:18.916
Why were there fireworks?

00:01:29.833 --> 00:01:31.958
All right. He'll be awake soon.

00:01:32.708 --> 00:01:33.541
Let's go.

00:02:10.458 --> 00:02:12.000
Wow, it's so beautiful.

00:02:12.875 --> 00:02:13.916
Sure is.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.750
Three, two, one…

00:02:27.208 --> 00:02:29.208
Jin Jin, look, we're almost there.

00:02:29.291 --> 00:02:32.041
"Welcome to Paradise".

00:02:32.875 --> 00:02:33.916
Nice, right?

00:02:47.583 --> 00:02:51.125
Jin Jin and An Chi are waiting.
They've been having a blast.

00:02:51.208 --> 00:02:52.625
- Really?
- 100%.

00:04:07.416 --> 00:04:08.416
How is she?

00:04:33.166 --> 00:04:34.333
You're a good girl.

00:04:35.458 --> 00:04:36.416
Don't worry.

00:04:37.333 --> 00:04:39.541
Good girls get treated well here.

00:04:46.625 --> 00:04:48.250
Help me!

00:04:48.875 --> 00:04:50.708
Help me!

00:05:29.916 --> 00:05:32.875
03 Execution Day

00:05:47.791 --> 00:05:48.791
Hello, Hui-chun?

00:05:49.416 --> 00:05:51.458
It's so cheap.

00:05:51.541 --> 00:05:54.500
Interested? Let us know in the comments!

00:05:54.583 --> 00:05:55.541
What'll you get?

00:05:55.625 --> 00:05:58.375
- This is it.
- You'll get exclusive VIP treatment

00:05:58.458 --> 00:06:01.041
- on top of golf clubs and caddies.
- Hear that?

00:06:01.125 --> 00:06:02.541
Okay, that's all for now.

00:06:02.625 --> 00:06:04.083
- No.
- Bye!

00:06:04.166 --> 00:06:05.333
Listen again.

00:06:06.541 --> 00:06:08.875
…on top of gold clubs and caddies.

00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:11.458
Okay, that's all for now. Bye!

00:06:11.541 --> 00:06:12.833
- Did you hear it?
- No.

00:06:12.916 --> 00:06:14.791
It sounded like the wind.

00:06:14.875 --> 00:06:17.500
Sounds like
someone yelling for help to me.

00:06:17.583 --> 00:06:20.291
And Jin Jin hasn't answered
my calls recently,

00:06:20.375 --> 00:06:21.541
or my messages.

00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:24.833
Do you think she's in trouble?

00:06:25.333 --> 00:06:26.916
You're overreacting.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.958
Look, she keeps uploading videos.
What trouble could she be in?

00:06:33.166 --> 00:06:34.125
All right.

00:06:34.208 --> 00:06:35.625
I'll call Hsin-yi now.

00:06:35.708 --> 00:06:37.375
She's with Jin Jin, right?

00:06:52.791 --> 00:06:53.791
No answer.

00:06:55.875 --> 00:06:56.875
I'll try again.

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:04.916
Hey, where are you?
Why didn't you pick up?

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.500
I'm at the hotel.
I didn't hear it. I was in the bathroom.

00:07:08.583 --> 00:07:09.583
Hsin-yi.

00:07:09.666 --> 00:07:11.041
Is Jin Jin there?

00:07:11.125 --> 00:07:12.500
She's right next to me.

00:07:13.041 --> 00:07:14.041
Mom, I'm here.

00:07:14.791 --> 00:07:18.041
What are you up to?
Why aren't you answering my messages?

00:07:18.125 --> 00:07:21.750
I dropped my phone in the swimming pool.
I haven't had it fixed yet.

00:07:21.833 --> 00:07:25.208
Mom, I've told you so many times
not to comment on my videos.

00:07:25.291 --> 00:07:28.125
- People will think it's weird.
- Hey, are you done?

00:07:28.208 --> 00:07:29.208
Oh, okay.

00:07:29.291 --> 00:07:31.791
Mom, we're heading out. Talk later.

00:07:31.875 --> 00:07:33.333
Hey…

00:07:36.666 --> 00:07:38.500
Look after yourself, Hsin-yi.

00:07:38.583 --> 00:07:42.000
Okay. Tell Dad not to worry.

00:07:42.083 --> 00:07:45.458
I'm almost done here. I'll see him soon.

00:07:45.541 --> 00:07:47.375
Okay, I have to go.

00:07:47.458 --> 00:07:48.500
Bye-bye!

00:07:49.583 --> 00:07:52.750
Kids these days hang up so quick.

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:03.875
Didn't Hsin-yi's dad
pass away a long time ago?

00:08:15.083 --> 00:08:16.250
Hey, you two!

00:08:16.333 --> 00:08:17.250
Take a picture.

00:08:17.916 --> 00:08:19.291
Smile, smile.

00:08:19.375 --> 00:08:22.083
- Smile, smile.
- Smile a bit, smile.

00:08:22.166 --> 00:08:23.958
- Smile, come on.
- Can you laugh?

00:08:24.041 --> 00:08:26.458
- Laugh for us.
- Alright.

00:08:26.541 --> 00:08:27.750
Good!

00:08:38.375 --> 00:08:41.541
I've asked someone
to take your luggage to the dorm.

00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:46.291
You know,
the conditions here aren't so bad.

00:08:58.291 --> 00:08:59.125
All right.

00:09:20.291 --> 00:09:22.041
- Ms. Hua.
- Yes.

00:09:23.791 --> 00:09:25.625
Come in. This is your room.

00:09:52.541 --> 00:09:53.541
Lucky, come.

00:10:40.583 --> 00:10:43.041
2. CONTACT: PHONE/ EMAIL
3. STYLE: KIND & SHORT

00:10:43.125 --> 00:10:45.833
4. PAYMENT: ATM/ ONLINE
ATTENTION TO DETAIL = BIG BUCKS

00:10:52.416 --> 00:10:54.500
This is where you’ll be working.

00:10:54.583 --> 00:10:57.666
Forget about escaping.
Everyone is armed. Understood?

00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:00.583
Here.

00:11:02.833 --> 00:11:03.666
Here.

00:11:05.375 --> 00:11:06.541
Mind the wires.

00:11:07.875 --> 00:11:10.208
Talk quietly in here. Everyone's working.

00:11:10.291 --> 00:11:11.625
Go.

00:11:11.708 --> 00:11:13.750
Right.

00:11:13.833 --> 00:11:15.208
Stop.

00:11:15.291 --> 00:11:16.500
This is your seat.

00:11:18.083 --> 00:11:19.125
This one.

00:11:21.291 --> 00:11:22.750
Come closer.

00:11:22.833 --> 00:11:25.333
The last girl left these notes.

00:11:25.416 --> 00:11:28.041
It tells you how to talk, what to say.

00:11:28.125 --> 00:11:30.958
Read it when you have time.

00:11:31.041 --> 00:11:33.708
Earn money, hit your quota,
and go home, okay?

00:11:33.791 --> 00:11:35.208
- Okay.
- Okay, sit down.

00:11:36.041 --> 00:11:38.875
Also, don't bother calling for help.

00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:41.458
Every phone is monitored, understand?

00:11:51.375 --> 00:11:52.666
Done.

00:11:54.416 --> 00:11:58.041
Enter your mobile number into that box.

00:11:58.125 --> 00:12:00.541
Yes, ma'am. Read the numbers to me.

00:12:07.541 --> 00:12:11.333
CALM, LOGICAL, PROFESSIONAL
LIE ABOUT FAMILY'S FINANCIAL SITUATION

00:12:13.208 --> 00:12:15.125
CHAPTER THREE, SPEECH TEMPLATE

00:12:19.625 --> 00:12:21.666
Yes, right.

00:12:44.333 --> 00:12:47.791
Stop looking. There are guards over there.
You can't escape.

00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:50.666
Hurry!

00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:52.125
Faster!

00:12:52.208 --> 00:12:54.333
- Good.
- Faster! Faster! Down you go.

00:12:54.416 --> 00:12:57.208
- Go down. Quickly!
- Everyone's waiting. Hurry up!

00:12:57.291 --> 00:12:59.375
After that, click on the link.

00:12:59.916 --> 00:13:01.000
Right.

00:13:01.083 --> 00:13:01.916
Yes.

00:13:29.291 --> 00:13:30.500
No one's answering.

00:13:31.291 --> 00:13:32.625
Then call the next one.

00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:37.416
Hurry up
or there won't be any food left.

00:13:52.875 --> 00:13:54.666
Have you found an ATM?

00:13:55.125 --> 00:13:57.458
Yes, I have.

00:13:57.541 --> 00:13:59.791
Please insert your ATM card.

00:13:59.875 --> 00:14:03.291
- I'll put it in then.
- Yes, put it in.

00:14:03.375 --> 00:14:05.875
You really want me to put it in?

00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:07.750
Yes, put it in.

00:14:07.833 --> 00:14:10.333
Where should I put it? In your pussy?

00:14:10.416 --> 00:14:11.875
You fucking scammer!

00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:14.250
You lowlife. Clean up your act.

00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:32.208
Hello, is there any food left?

00:14:33.875 --> 00:14:34.708
Food?

00:14:49.208 --> 00:14:50.375
What are you doing?

00:14:50.458 --> 00:14:52.583
There’s nothing to eat here. Get out.

00:14:52.666 --> 00:14:53.666
Get out!

00:14:57.958 --> 00:14:59.125
Go clean over there.

00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:27.791
Hey.

00:15:41.291 --> 00:15:42.291
Do you want this?

00:15:53.083 --> 00:15:54.083
Thank you.

00:15:58.250 --> 00:15:59.083
Lucky.

00:16:02.833 --> 00:16:03.958
Are you Hsin-yi?

00:16:04.750 --> 00:16:05.916
Yes.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.041
I'm Wu Mei-juan.

00:16:07.125 --> 00:16:08.083
That's Lucky.

00:16:10.416 --> 00:16:11.416
He's super cute.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.458
Can I stroke him?

00:16:15.708 --> 00:16:16.541
Yes.

00:16:32.833 --> 00:16:36.208
There's a refund in your account
that hasn't been processed.

00:16:36.291 --> 00:16:37.125
I need…

00:16:38.708 --> 00:16:41.375
Have you received
another text message yet?

00:16:41.458 --> 00:16:44.041
6635.

00:16:44.125 --> 00:16:46.500
Oh, we've already received it.

00:16:46.583 --> 00:16:48.083
Thank you, ma'am.

00:16:48.166 --> 00:16:49.833
Okay, bye.

00:16:59.791 --> 00:17:01.166
267 is up.

00:17:03.166 --> 00:17:04.208
Finished.

00:17:06.708 --> 00:17:07.875
Reached your quota?

00:17:09.375 --> 00:17:10.291
Done.

00:17:15.708 --> 00:17:16.750
Check, check.

00:17:26.166 --> 00:17:27.291
Go and eat.

00:17:27.375 --> 00:17:28.541
Hey, here.

00:17:30.166 --> 00:17:31.000
Come on.

00:17:49.125 --> 00:17:50.125
Mei-juan.

00:17:51.416 --> 00:17:52.541
Congratulations.

00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:56.000
Wow.

00:18:06.166 --> 00:18:07.208
Mei-juan.

00:18:08.916 --> 00:18:10.333
What are you scared of?

00:18:10.416 --> 00:18:13.458
This is your big day, you should be happy.

00:18:14.125 --> 00:18:15.125
Cheer up.

00:18:17.083 --> 00:18:19.541
Okay, you can pack up now.

00:18:53.625 --> 00:18:55.041
Good evening, everyone.

00:18:56.250 --> 00:18:57.250
Good evening.

00:18:57.333 --> 00:18:58.708
Good evening!

00:19:03.875 --> 00:19:07.083
Today, let me formally announce

00:19:07.166 --> 00:19:10.750
that one of our company's outstanding
employees, Wu Mei-juan,

00:19:10.833 --> 00:19:13.791
has officially reached her quota.

00:19:13.875 --> 00:19:15.291
A round of applause!

00:19:20.833 --> 00:19:22.208
Come on, louder!

00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:24.125
Jin Jin.

00:19:25.666 --> 00:19:28.083
Come,
Wu Mei-juan, please get up on stage.

00:19:29.583 --> 00:19:30.416
Shut up.

00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:32.958
- More applause for Mei-juan!
- Look ahead.

00:19:37.125 --> 00:19:38.166
Mei-juan.

00:19:38.916 --> 00:19:41.375
Before she leaves our big family,

00:19:41.458 --> 00:19:42.958
on behalf of the company,

00:19:43.041 --> 00:19:48.000
I'd like to thank Mei-juan
for her three years of hard work,

00:19:48.083 --> 00:19:52.166
and award Wu Mei-juan
her full sales commission.

00:19:52.250 --> 00:19:54.750
Round of applause!

00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:58.875
Mei-juan.

00:19:59.916 --> 00:20:03.833
What will you do with so much money
when you return to Taiwan?

00:20:06.458 --> 00:20:12.000
{\an8}I want to go back to my hometown
and help my grandma build a new house.

00:20:12.083 --> 00:20:14.208
You're a good example to all of us.

00:20:14.291 --> 00:20:15.708
Clap your hands!

00:20:17.708 --> 00:20:19.333
That's our boss!

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.958
It's time for our long-awaited
fireworks show!

00:21:20.625 --> 00:21:22.250
Hey, you can't take the dog.

00:21:32.875 --> 00:21:35.000
Can I say goodbye to Lucky?

00:21:37.125 --> 00:21:38.125
Wait outside.

00:21:48.375 --> 00:21:50.166
Can I speak to her in private?

00:22:05.666 --> 00:22:06.958
Lucky...

00:22:07.041 --> 00:22:09.250
Take good care of Hsin-yi.

00:22:11.375 --> 00:22:12.291
Hsin-yi.

00:22:12.958 --> 00:22:14.000
Yes?

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.375
Listen...

00:22:17.208 --> 00:22:20.791
you should call your friends
or people you know.

00:22:20.875 --> 00:22:23.208
It'll be easier to get money out of them.

00:22:23.916 --> 00:22:25.666
Don't feel bad about scamming them.

00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:28.958
What matters most
is reaching your quota and getting out.

00:22:29.833 --> 00:22:30.916
Do you understand?

00:22:48.291 --> 00:22:49.291
Don't go hungry.

00:22:55.041 --> 00:22:56.083
Thank you.

00:23:29.083 --> 00:23:33.041
LIE ABOUT FAMILY'S FINANCIAL SITUATION

00:23:56.083 --> 00:23:57.083
Hello?

00:23:58.583 --> 00:23:59.625
Ms. Chen.

00:24:00.875 --> 00:24:01.958
I'm Hsin-yi.

00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:04.166
Hsin-yi?

00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:09.083
I heard you got into a good school.
Congratulations. I'm so happy for you.

00:24:10.125 --> 00:24:11.125
Thank you.

00:24:11.208 --> 00:24:14.500
My pleasure.
Come and see me when you get the chance.

00:24:15.208 --> 00:24:16.583
Ms. Chen.

00:24:16.666 --> 00:24:19.500
Actually, I have a favor to ask.

00:24:19.583 --> 00:24:20.916
What is it? Go ahead.

00:24:23.958 --> 00:24:26.583
We've had some problems at home lately,

00:24:26.666 --> 00:24:29.458
but the school keeps asking
for my tuition fees.

00:24:30.625 --> 00:24:32.625
Can I borrow some money from you?

00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:36.958
Of course. How much do you need?

00:24:37.041 --> 00:24:40.291
Send me your account number.
I'll transfer it immediately.

00:24:40.833 --> 00:24:43.583
Thank you, I'll pay you back at once.

00:24:43.666 --> 00:24:45.166
It's okay. No rush.

00:24:45.250 --> 00:24:47.208
I know things aren't easy at home.

00:24:47.291 --> 00:24:49.916
Study hard and make your mom proud.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.916
I'll send the money straight over.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:53.541
Bye-bye.

00:24:53.625 --> 00:24:55.666
Okay, thank you.

00:25:00.791 --> 00:25:01.791
Successful?

00:25:03.125 --> 00:25:04.208
Very good.

00:25:05.666 --> 00:25:08.166
Hurry up,
there's only food for five of you.

00:25:23.583 --> 00:25:25.125
GOAL!

00:25:25.208 --> 00:25:26.166
Good job.

00:25:26.250 --> 00:25:27.416
Keep it up.

00:25:32.875 --> 00:25:33.708
Eat up.

00:25:40.333 --> 00:25:42.666
Lucky, let's eat.

00:26:08.583 --> 00:26:11.125
Hi, Mrs. Chang, it's Hsin-yi.

00:26:12.125 --> 00:26:13.666
Yes, it's been a long time.

00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:17.166
I've been helping
a stray dog organization raise funds.

00:26:17.250 --> 00:26:19.250
You've always been kind-hearted.

00:26:23.708 --> 00:26:26.125
Your payment has been confirmed.

00:26:26.208 --> 00:26:27.583
Thank you, goodbye.

00:26:30.458 --> 00:26:32.458
You've been performing well lately.

00:26:32.541 --> 00:26:33.916
Keep it up,

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.166
and I'll consider letting you go home.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.875
What the fuck are you looking at?
Go! Go!

00:26:55.708 --> 00:26:57.083
Get going!

00:26:58.125 --> 00:26:59.958
Hurry up!

00:27:02.333 --> 00:27:06.916
Did you authorize a transaction
on the credit card ending 4578?

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.791
Your payment has been confirmed.

00:27:08.875 --> 00:27:09.958
Around 50,000.

00:27:13.125 --> 00:27:14.041
Eat up.

00:27:14.125 --> 00:27:15.625
We'll handle this swiftly.

00:27:15.708 --> 00:27:17.500
Please ensure your phone is on.

00:27:17.583 --> 00:27:20.000
Okay, I won't keep you then, goodbye.

00:27:21.625 --> 00:27:22.875
Mr. Chang, it's Hsin-yi.

00:27:22.958 --> 00:27:24.041
Thanks, Mrs. Chang.

00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:31.916
I will process your refund right away.

00:27:35.333 --> 00:27:38.333
You will receive a refund
within the next 12 hours.

00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:43.333
Thank you, sir. Have a nice day.

00:27:45.125 --> 00:27:46.208
Thirty thousand here.

00:27:47.791 --> 00:27:49.125
Fifty thousand here.

00:27:49.208 --> 00:27:50.166
TO DO BACK HOME

00:28:05.416 --> 00:28:06.250
Hmm.

00:28:09.166 --> 00:28:10.333
Lucky?

00:28:18.375 --> 00:28:19.375
Lucky?

00:28:24.375 --> 00:28:25.500
Lucky?

00:29:33.041 --> 00:29:34.041
Lucky?

00:29:54.958 --> 00:29:56.041
Lucky?

00:29:56.125 --> 00:29:57.291
Come here.

00:30:09.333 --> 00:30:10.333
Lucky?

00:30:43.208 --> 00:30:44.041
Lucky.

00:31:04.958 --> 00:31:06.958
Lucky, take good care of Hsin-yi.

00:31:20.291 --> 00:31:21.583
I'm sorry.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:24.708
It won't happen again.

00:31:25.375 --> 00:31:26.708
It won't happen again.

00:32:57.083 --> 00:32:59.416
Did we give him too much sedative?

00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:57.208
Multiple stab wounds.

00:34:09.958 --> 00:34:11.083
Where am I?

00:34:11.916 --> 00:34:13.458
Hell.

00:34:40.166 --> 00:34:42.000
Two fractured ribs.

00:34:42.833 --> 00:34:44.875
Motherfuckers! Let me go!

00:34:45.708 --> 00:34:46.541
Let me go!

00:35:13.541 --> 00:35:14.625
Let me go!

00:35:15.625 --> 00:35:17.208
Hey!

00:35:17.291 --> 00:35:19.583
Did you bribe the prison guards?

00:35:21.333 --> 00:35:22.333
Hey!

00:35:39.958 --> 00:35:42.083
Severe shoulder wound.

00:35:42.166 --> 00:35:43.958
I'm not dead!

00:35:55.083 --> 00:35:56.416
Do it.

00:35:58.833 --> 00:36:00.916
Looks like Hsin-yi took after her mom.

00:36:03.083 --> 00:36:03.958
Do it!

00:36:07.125 --> 00:36:08.583
I'll fucking kill you both!

00:36:09.208 --> 00:36:10.250
I'll kill you!

00:37:09.458 --> 00:37:11.125
Don't tell me he's dead?

00:37:14.375 --> 00:37:17.166
Go and see if he's breathing.

00:37:31.458 --> 00:37:33.000
I don't think he is.

00:37:33.750 --> 00:37:36.458
What should we do?
We spent all that money.

00:37:36.541 --> 00:37:39.208
Surely we haven't killed him
on the first day?

00:37:41.583 --> 00:37:42.625
CPR.

00:38:28.625 --> 00:38:30.041
What do we do now?

00:38:33.125 --> 00:38:34.166
Call an ambulance.

00:38:43.416 --> 00:38:44.583
Clean this up.

00:38:44.666 --> 00:38:46.041
I'll call an ambulance.

00:38:49.291 --> 00:38:50.791
And wipe your face.

00:39:17.416 --> 00:39:18.416
What happened?

00:39:20.333 --> 00:39:21.333
Overdose.

00:39:23.791 --> 00:39:24.625
Yeah.

00:39:27.125 --> 00:39:29.125
Why does he have so many injuries?

00:39:31.041 --> 00:39:32.041
We don't know.

00:39:36.375 --> 00:39:37.375
Okay.

00:39:37.916 --> 00:39:40.916
We will run some tests
when we get to the hospital.

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:42.666
They'll run some tests on him.

00:39:43.250 --> 00:39:45.291
- What now?
- That's not the problem.

00:39:46.041 --> 00:39:48.916
Our biggest problem
is he doesn't have any ID.

00:39:49.708 --> 00:39:50.541
Hey.

00:39:51.208 --> 00:39:54.291
Don't you have your husband's passport?
We can use that.

00:40:04.625 --> 00:40:05.916
They look nothing alike.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:07.666
They'll never tell from the photo.

00:40:22.125 --> 00:40:23.458
Why'd the ambulance stop?

00:40:25.291 --> 00:40:27.750
The police are coming. What do we do?

00:40:27.833 --> 00:40:29.500
We'll be fine. Calm down.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.791
- Hey!
- Don't move!

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.291
I said don't move!

00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:46.583
What are you doing?

00:40:47.708 --> 00:40:48.666
Open the door!

00:40:52.083 --> 00:40:53.041
Open the door!

00:41:07.125 --> 00:41:08.541
Stop!

00:41:10.750 --> 00:41:11.750
Stop!

00:42:19.833 --> 00:42:20.708
Go.

00:43:21.500 --> 00:43:23.583
Don't get into my car!

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:25.958
Other side!

00:44:44.250 --> 00:44:45.250
Thank you.

00:46:35.333 --> 00:46:36.791
I told you to go gentler.

00:46:36.875 --> 00:46:38.291
What if you kill him again?

00:46:38.875 --> 00:46:39.875
You do it then.

00:46:48.750 --> 00:46:51.375
Where's it gonna hurt but not kill him?

00:46:53.333 --> 00:46:55.166
Here. Here.

00:46:55.250 --> 00:46:56.291
Come on.

00:46:58.750 --> 00:47:00.708
What if I break it?

00:47:00.791 --> 00:47:02.291
Good, then he can't run away.

00:47:02.375 --> 00:47:04.125
I'd have to sterilize his wounds.

00:47:04.208 --> 00:47:07.625
- It's easy. You can--
- We spent so much resurrecting him.

00:47:07.708 --> 00:47:09.791
- It's a waste killing him.
- Just hit here.

00:47:09.875 --> 00:47:11.958
- He's so heavy.
- What exactly do you want?

00:47:14.208 --> 00:47:15.375
Do you want me dead…

00:47:17.208 --> 00:47:18.791
or alive?

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:44.166
What should we do next?
There's no point just going on like this.

00:47:50.666 --> 00:47:51.666
Hello?

00:47:59.916 --> 00:48:01.541
What did the hospital say?

00:48:03.083 --> 00:48:04.083
Not much.

00:48:05.541 --> 00:48:08.750
It'll either be heart failure
or fluid in the lungs.

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:13.291
She's in a bad way.
We must get her to the ICU.

00:48:15.791 --> 00:48:17.125
- Jin Jin…
- Let us through.

00:48:17.208 --> 00:48:18.666
- Jin Jin.
- Sorry.

00:48:18.750 --> 00:48:19.958
Clear the way.

00:48:23.166 --> 00:48:24.958
Her creatinine level is very high.

00:48:25.041 --> 00:48:26.916
We need to perform CRRT immediately.

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:29.416
This procedure
has a high risk of infection.

00:48:29.500 --> 00:48:30.875
This is the consent form.

00:48:32.250 --> 00:48:34.458
She was fine yesterday.
What happened to her?

00:48:34.541 --> 00:48:38.000
Preliminary diagnosis suggests kidney
failure caused by heart failure,

00:48:38.083 --> 00:48:39.875
so she needs CRRT.

00:48:39.958 --> 00:48:41.333
Will she recover?

00:48:41.916 --> 00:48:45.083
The best outcome
is that she returns to her previous state.

00:48:45.166 --> 00:48:47.375
If you want us to proceed, sign here.

00:48:53.916 --> 00:48:55.833
This has happened before.

00:48:55.916 --> 00:48:57.625
You know the implications.

00:48:58.208 --> 00:49:00.458
Do you want to treat her or let her go?

00:49:35.333 --> 00:49:38.458
You still need to pay 25,000 more.

00:49:43.375 --> 00:49:44.708
Let me pay.

00:49:46.125 --> 00:49:47.875
No, thanks. I've got it.

00:49:49.291 --> 00:49:50.708
I just paid.

00:49:50.791 --> 00:49:52.000
Okay, thank you.

00:49:53.125 --> 00:49:54.125
Go.

00:49:55.500 --> 00:49:56.791
I still owe you 6,500 NTD.

00:50:17.791 --> 00:50:18.791
How is she?

00:50:21.041 --> 00:50:22.166
She's out of danger.

00:50:24.250 --> 00:50:25.250
Thank you.

00:50:42.791 --> 00:50:44.166
I really don't know

00:50:44.791 --> 00:50:48.166
why I keep going on like this.

00:50:49.750 --> 00:50:51.291
Sometimes I think…

00:50:53.125 --> 00:50:54.791
if I lost Jin Jin…

00:50:56.875 --> 00:50:58.833
I could also resurrect her.

00:51:00.666 --> 00:51:03.000
At least I could say a proper farewell.

00:51:07.416 --> 00:51:08.625
Don't think like that.

00:51:09.625 --> 00:51:11.666
But having her just lie there…

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:15.791
What kind of life is that?

00:51:21.166 --> 00:51:23.958
It just makes me look
like a good, devoted mother.

00:51:27.375 --> 00:51:29.083
You've always been a good mother.

00:51:39.375 --> 00:51:41.041
I thought to let her go at first.

00:51:48.875 --> 00:51:49.875
But one day,

00:51:50.416 --> 00:51:51.708
I don't know why,

00:51:51.791 --> 00:51:54.250
she suddenly held my hand.

00:51:55.833 --> 00:51:57.708
I called out to her and she reacted.

00:51:59.375 --> 00:52:00.708
It made me so happy.

00:52:04.125 --> 00:52:05.916
I thought she was going to wake up.

00:52:10.666 --> 00:52:12.583
But then the doctor said…

00:52:14.083 --> 00:52:16.375
it was just
a normal neurological reflex.

00:52:18.625 --> 00:52:20.208
But I believe

00:52:20.291 --> 00:52:22.208
it could be a sign from heaven…

00:52:24.208 --> 00:52:26.208
to give Jin Jin another chance.

00:52:28.750 --> 00:52:31.000
That one day she will wake up.

00:52:36.041 --> 00:52:37.041
You know,

00:52:37.750 --> 00:52:39.166
I envy you.

00:52:45.541 --> 00:52:46.833
These past five years,

00:52:48.083 --> 00:52:51.000
it hasn't been the despair
that hurts the most…

00:52:52.833 --> 00:52:54.958
it's the endless hope.

00:53:06.291 --> 00:53:07.291
You know,

00:53:08.583 --> 00:53:10.458
however we punish Chang Shih-kai,

00:53:11.750 --> 00:53:13.000
in seven days,

00:53:13.833 --> 00:53:15.958
we'll be right back at square one.

00:53:16.041 --> 00:53:17.000
Right.

00:53:18.166 --> 00:53:20.041
And have endless bills to pay.

00:53:22.125 --> 00:53:24.083
Jin Jin might never wake up.

00:53:27.833 --> 00:53:29.833
We all lost a family member…

00:53:32.875 --> 00:53:34.666
so how come Chang Shih-kai's mom

00:53:36.125 --> 00:53:37.958
gets to go on living so carefree?

00:53:40.833 --> 00:53:42.583
It's so fucking unfair.

00:53:55.583 --> 00:53:59.916
AN EYE FOR AN EYE, A TOOTH FOR A TOOTH

00:54:06.333 --> 00:54:07.666
Didn't you say...

00:54:09.125 --> 00:54:10.750
that what hurts the most...

00:54:12.458 --> 00:54:13.583
isn't the despair...

00:54:15.750 --> 00:54:17.750
it's the endless hope?

00:55:37.208 --> 00:55:38.208
Jin Jin?

00:55:41.416 --> 00:55:42.416
Jin Jin?

00:55:43.375 --> 00:55:44.291
Doctor!

00:56:10.333 --> 00:56:11.458
TO DO BACK HOME

00:56:11.541 --> 00:56:13.625
1. APOLOGIZE TO MY VICTIMS
2. EAT LOADS!

00:56:13.708 --> 00:56:16.791
3. FINISH COLLEGE
& GET A FULL SCHOLARSHIP

00:56:16.875 --> 00:56:18.250
4. BRING LUCKY HOME

00:57:38.875 --> 00:57:39.875
So...

00:57:41.208 --> 00:57:42.916
have you decided what you want?

00:57:44.958 --> 00:57:46.291
We want money.

00:57:47.291 --> 00:57:49.458
Otherwise, what's the point

00:57:49.541 --> 00:57:51.083
of keeping you here all day?

00:57:52.458 --> 00:57:53.416
Money?

00:57:53.500 --> 00:57:55.916
We should save the money for the living.

00:57:56.916 --> 00:57:58.625
You told us that.

00:58:00.291 --> 00:58:01.500
We've thought about it.

00:58:01.583 --> 00:58:04.041
People shouldn't live in the past.

00:58:04.125 --> 00:58:05.958
They should look forward.

00:58:08.083 --> 00:58:11.333
So she's going to return
to Kuala Lumpur and open a store.

00:58:11.416 --> 00:58:14.500
And I'm going back to Taipei
to take care of my daughter.

00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:18.291
But we both need money to start over.

00:58:19.625 --> 00:58:20.666
You could, too.

00:58:21.875 --> 00:58:22.875
Me?

00:58:23.666 --> 00:58:24.750
What do you mean?

00:58:24.833 --> 00:58:28.125
Legally speaking,
Chang Shih-kai's been executed.

00:58:28.208 --> 00:58:29.416
He's dead.

00:58:30.125 --> 00:58:34.666
You could live a new life
with a new identity.

00:58:34.750 --> 00:58:36.791
No one would know who you were.

00:58:36.875 --> 00:58:39.791
And no one would care what you've done.

00:58:45.041 --> 00:58:46.083
Okay.

00:58:46.166 --> 00:58:47.583
Sure.

00:58:47.666 --> 00:58:50.125
Let me go. I'll get you your money.

00:58:50.208 --> 00:58:52.083
You didn't let Hsin-yi go.

00:58:52.666 --> 00:58:54.666
How did you use her to make money?

00:58:55.958 --> 00:58:57.208
I'll give you a clue.

00:58:58.500 --> 00:59:00.583
Let's start with those closest to you.

00:59:00.666 --> 00:59:03.083
WE'VE HAD
SOME PROBLEMS AT HOME LATELY

00:59:03.666 --> 00:59:05.416
I'm guessing you're a good son.

00:59:05.541 --> 00:59:07.791
Or you wouldn't have
transferred your assets

00:59:07.875 --> 00:59:09.541
to your family before you died.

00:59:10.208 --> 00:59:14.583
We just want you to leave
a portion of that to us.

00:59:14.666 --> 00:59:16.833
That's not asking too much, is it?

00:59:17.666 --> 00:59:18.500
Of course not.

00:59:18.583 --> 00:59:19.416
That's fine.

00:59:20.750 --> 00:59:22.750
Now you've agreed to help us,

00:59:22.833 --> 00:59:25.333
we'll give you a new life.

00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:30.375
A life full of hope and freedom.

00:59:31.166 --> 00:59:33.708
Get us our money within seven days...

00:59:34.541 --> 00:59:35.583
and we'll let you go.

00:59:35.666 --> 00:59:37.375
No need. Three days.

00:59:39.458 --> 00:59:41.000
Two days.

00:59:41.083 --> 00:59:42.791
I'll get it for you in two days.

00:59:43.541 --> 00:59:45.291
Okay? How much do you want?

00:59:50.291 --> 00:59:51.750
How much do you think...

00:59:52.333 --> 00:59:54.000
our daughters' lives are worth?

00:59:55.125 --> 00:59:56.458
How much do you think

00:59:56.541 --> 00:59:59.291
our suffering all these years is worth?

00:59:59.375 --> 01:00:01.666
How much would your mom
pay to save you?

01:00:02.541 --> 01:00:05.166
How much is your life worth?

01:00:09.708 --> 01:00:10.875
Write it down.

01:00:14.375 --> 01:00:17.000
Hurry, or you won't have anything to eat.

01:00:43.625 --> 01:00:45.708
One hundred thousand? Are you kidding me?

01:00:47.041 --> 01:00:48.500
{\an8}KNOW YOUR PLACE

01:01:03.708 --> 01:01:04.875
Ten million.

01:01:29.125 --> 01:01:31.333
Before you leave our big family,

01:01:31.416 --> 01:01:33.125
on behalf of the company,

01:01:33.666 --> 01:01:35.166
I will award Wu Mei-juan

01:01:35.958 --> 01:01:38.166
her full sales commission.

01:01:39.625 --> 01:01:41.708
Time for our long-awaited fireworks show!

01:01:43.875 --> 01:01:44.916
Deal.

01:01:52.250 --> 01:01:53.125
Fuck.

01:01:54.250 --> 01:01:56.833
Forty million, you can do it.

01:02:50.166 --> 01:02:53.125
Chang Shih-kai's resurrection
is meaningless to us...

01:02:54.750 --> 01:02:57.750
but that might not necessarily
be the case for others.

01:03:06.125 --> 01:03:08.125
The next few days should be exciting.
