WEBVTT

00:00:41.041 --> 00:00:42.917
ALL NAMES, CHARACTERS,
AND EVENTS ARE FICTIONAL

00:00:43.001 --> 00:00:44.961
CHILD AND ANIMAL WELFARE
REGULATIONS WERE OBSERVED

00:00:57.182 --> 00:00:59.059
Seon-ho, let's get going.

00:00:59.142 --> 00:01:00.518
Okay. Coming.

00:01:05.982 --> 00:01:06.983
I'm leaving now.

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:08.735
I'll see you later.

00:01:09.903 --> 00:01:13.073
Please don't argue

00:01:14.074 --> 00:01:15.617
and try to get along.

00:01:19.996 --> 00:01:23.625
Geez, I wonder why my knees were aching.

00:01:23.708 --> 00:01:25.627
It looks like it will rain.

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:26.544
What?

00:01:27.462 --> 00:01:29.798
Rain? But it's so sunny.

00:01:31.382 --> 00:01:33.760
It will rain. You'll see.

00:01:41.226 --> 00:01:45.730
Chairman of H Group, Yang Hoon, who is
facing charges of illegal succession,

00:01:45.814 --> 00:01:48.691
appeared in court today
for a pre-trial detention hearing.

00:01:48.775 --> 00:01:51.319
A decision on Chairman Yang's custody
is expected

00:01:51.402 --> 00:01:53.404
between midnight and early morning.

00:01:53.488 --> 00:01:54.989
What we need is evidence.

00:01:55.073 --> 00:01:56.866
Proving the defendant's wrong

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.661
and providing physical evidence
will be the key.

00:01:59.744 --> 00:02:03.623
I went to Chairman Yang's vacation home
to see his special guest today.

00:02:03.706 --> 00:02:05.458
And guess who I met there.

00:02:06.042 --> 00:02:08.002
Hwa-jin. Lee Hwa-jin!

00:02:08.086 --> 00:02:11.589
So Chairman Yang is using
Lee Hwa-jin as a free pass.

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.384
That's why she called Choi Myeong-ju in.

00:02:14.926 --> 00:02:17.971
He's offering Lee Hwa-jin
in exchange for his release.

00:02:25.687 --> 00:02:27.730
FIRST LADY'S SECRETARY PARK SANG-HUI

00:02:32.443 --> 00:02:34.571
Hello, Secretary Park.
This is Cha Su-yeon.

00:02:35.196 --> 00:02:37.115
I'd like to meet the First Lady.

00:02:37.991 --> 00:02:40.785
SUNSHINE GROUP'S SOUP KITCHEN DAY

00:02:41.995 --> 00:02:43.121
Welcome.

00:02:45.123 --> 00:02:46.291
Enjoy.

00:02:46.374 --> 00:02:48.167
-Thanks for the food.
-Sure.

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:50.962
Thanks for the food.

00:02:51.045 --> 00:02:52.005
-Ma'am.
-Yes.

00:02:52.088 --> 00:02:53.715
Try to look more natural.

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:58.094
How can I look natural
with the cameras moving around?

00:02:58.177 --> 00:02:59.888
Come on. You're doing a great job.

00:02:59.971 --> 00:03:01.306
-Geez.
-Secretary Park.

00:03:02.056 --> 00:03:04.309
Let's take a quick touch-up break.

00:03:04.392 --> 00:03:05.518
Shall we?

00:03:06.436 --> 00:03:08.187
All right. Go for it.

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.322
This is looking good.

00:03:18.197 --> 00:03:19.908
Oh, no. It wasn't enough food.

00:03:20.825 --> 00:03:22.076
Here.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.370
Come back for more if you need it.

00:03:24.454 --> 00:03:25.955
It's looking great.

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:28.041
Here you go.

00:03:28.124 --> 00:03:31.210
There. Enjoy.

00:03:32.128 --> 00:03:33.546
-Ma'am.
-Yes?

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.092
Good. Shall we wrap up here, then?

00:03:39.135 --> 00:03:41.721
-Good work.
-Good work.

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.726
Good work, everyone.

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:47.977
Geez, my back hurts.

00:03:48.061 --> 00:03:49.312
Good job.

00:03:49.395 --> 00:03:51.314
-Good job.
-Thanks.

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:54.817
-What?
-Could you check the photos?

00:03:54.901 --> 00:03:55.902
Sure.

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:58.154
I like this one

00:03:59.614 --> 00:04:01.574
and this one.

00:04:02.075 --> 00:04:04.494
You and Secretary Park pick the B-cuts.

00:04:04.577 --> 00:04:05.453
Yes, ma'am.

00:04:05.536 --> 00:04:06.704
Thank you.

00:04:07.288 --> 00:04:10.458
-Thank you.
-Good work.

00:04:10.541 --> 00:04:11.960
Thanks for your help, ma'am.

00:04:12.043 --> 00:04:14.337
-Thanks for your help.
-Good job.

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:16.839
-You're amazing.
-Oh, please.

00:04:16.923 --> 00:04:18.591
You did a wonderful job.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:24.681
Unbelievable.

00:04:24.764 --> 00:04:26.891
How dare you show your face here?

00:04:26.975 --> 00:04:29.852
Are you getting a handover
from the First Lady or what?

00:04:29.936 --> 00:04:31.521
She hasn't divorced yet.

00:04:31.604 --> 00:04:34.482
This is her last gasp,
saying "It's not over for me yet."

00:04:34.565 --> 00:04:36.234
Right. It's her last gasp.

00:04:36.317 --> 00:04:38.194
Let's just leave her be.

00:04:38.278 --> 00:04:41.614
Let her do whatever she wants
before her downfall.

00:04:42.156 --> 00:04:44.075
It's not just her last gasp.

00:04:44.158 --> 00:04:47.787
The whole world knows that
she and Chairman Yang are in it together.

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:52.583
And Chairman Yang is now
about to land behind bars.

00:04:53.084 --> 00:04:54.544
Isn't it obvious why she's here?

00:04:54.627 --> 00:04:58.631
Are you saying she's here
to beg the First Lady for help?

00:04:58.715 --> 00:05:03.261
No wonder she's been doing the dishes
with her mouth shut.

00:05:03.344 --> 00:05:06.889
No. She's always been
good at doing the dishes.

00:05:06.973 --> 00:05:09.017
She's like a human dishwasher.

00:05:09.517 --> 00:05:12.437
-"A human dishwasher."
-Right.

00:05:13.521 --> 00:05:15.898
-"A human dishwasher."
-What are you so happy about?

00:05:15.982 --> 00:05:17.150
Ma'am.

00:05:19.277 --> 00:05:21.529
I'm so happy because you're here with us.

00:05:21.612 --> 00:05:23.614
-Oh, come on.
-She's right.

00:05:23.698 --> 00:05:26.743
We're doing good deeds
while hearing your encouragement.

00:05:27.327 --> 00:05:29.537
-We can't be happier.
-Right.

00:05:30.413 --> 00:05:32.957
You're just flattering me.

00:05:33.041 --> 00:05:35.460
All right. Let's clean up and go.

00:05:35.543 --> 00:05:37.003
We should have some food too.

00:05:37.086 --> 00:05:38.796
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

00:05:48.056 --> 00:05:49.098
Can we

00:05:49.807 --> 00:05:50.808
talk?

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:58.816
FIRST LADY BRINGS WARMTH
TO SOUP KITCHEN

00:05:59.776 --> 00:06:03.738
I look so puffy.

00:06:05.156 --> 00:06:06.282
Don't you agree?

00:06:07.241 --> 00:06:09.619
No way. You look gorgeous.

00:06:10.453 --> 00:06:12.997
I feel embarrassed, hearing that from you.

00:06:14.373 --> 00:06:16.209
You look worn out.

00:06:17.585 --> 00:06:20.671
No wonder though. It must be tough.

00:06:21.964 --> 00:06:23.132
It's okay.

00:06:24.258 --> 00:06:25.384
I'm doing fine.

00:06:26.552 --> 00:06:29.555
Being tough is good,
but don't pretend to be tough.

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:33.810
I mean, we're supposed
to be honest with each other.

00:06:34.519 --> 00:06:36.062
I'm kind of hurt.

00:06:36.145 --> 00:06:38.189
I appreciate your concern.

00:06:39.649 --> 00:06:41.359
But I'm really fine.

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:45.029
I heard you're taking it to court.

00:06:46.906 --> 00:06:48.074
It looks like it.

00:06:48.157 --> 00:06:49.408
I see.

00:06:49.492 --> 00:06:51.536
I told them not to publish your photo.

00:06:51.619 --> 00:06:54.413
This isn't a good time to be talked about.

00:06:55.039 --> 00:06:56.165
I appreciate it.

00:06:56.999 --> 00:07:00.962
And thanks for mentioning me
to the President as well.

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:03.756
I did my best,

00:07:04.549 --> 00:07:06.551
but this is all he can do.

00:07:07.176 --> 00:07:09.178
Sure, the ruling party has been switched.

00:07:09.262 --> 00:07:11.973
But the party's complaining
about delaying the meeting

00:07:12.056 --> 00:07:13.266
with the President-elect.

00:07:14.934 --> 00:07:16.102
I apologize.

00:07:17.103 --> 00:07:18.354
I should've been

00:07:19.105 --> 00:07:20.606
more considerate.

00:07:24.444 --> 00:07:26.988
I'm keeping them waiting.

00:07:28.656 --> 00:07:31.200
I suppose you don't want to join.

00:07:40.585 --> 00:07:42.295
I borrowed these from you.

00:07:42.378 --> 00:07:44.464
I forgot to give them back.

00:07:44.547 --> 00:07:45.631
What?

00:07:45.715 --> 00:07:47.216
The earrings.

00:07:52.388 --> 00:07:54.599
YU JIN-MYEONG
APRIL 4, 2012

00:08:17.371 --> 00:08:18.289
Right.

00:08:20.458 --> 00:08:23.169
You could've sent it through someone.

00:08:23.252 --> 00:08:25.755
There was no need to bring it yourself.

00:08:29.967 --> 00:08:31.260
Well.

00:08:31.344 --> 00:08:34.889
No matter how busy you are,
you must not skip meals.

00:08:36.516 --> 00:08:39.560
People say that for a reason.

00:08:39.644 --> 00:08:42.188
You need to eat even better

00:08:42.271 --> 00:08:44.357
at times like this.

00:08:50.279 --> 00:08:51.989
-There she goes.
-Oh, my.

00:08:52.073 --> 00:08:54.033
Should we follow her car?

00:08:54.116 --> 00:08:55.243
-Yes.
-Good.

00:09:03.292 --> 00:09:04.210
-What?
-What?

00:09:04.293 --> 00:09:06.003
Looks like they're going to eat together.

00:09:06.087 --> 00:09:07.755
-Unbelievable.
-That's insane.

00:09:07.838 --> 00:09:08.881
This is annoying.

00:09:20.059 --> 00:09:23.521
Cha Su-yeon, the President-elect's wife
who is at the center of attention,

00:09:23.604 --> 00:09:25.398
delivered a personal apology

00:09:25.481 --> 00:09:28.067
to her supporters
in front of her residence today.

00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:29.819
Following her sincere apology,

00:09:29.902 --> 00:09:33.447
fan clubs that had been staging protests
dispersed from the scene.

00:09:33.531 --> 00:09:37.118
Yet the scandal caused a major setback
to President-elect Hyun Min-cheol,

00:09:37.201 --> 00:09:39.370
even before his inauguration.

00:09:39.453 --> 00:09:41.956
The results of today's research show--

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:47.336
The President plans
to visit the flood site.

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:48.588
Why don't you join him?

00:09:49.505 --> 00:09:52.008
It'll be a good chance
to turn public opinion around.

00:09:54.552 --> 00:09:56.596
A good chance?
When people died and got hurt?

00:09:57.638 --> 00:09:58.681
I'm sorry.

00:09:59.348 --> 00:10:02.727
But right now, we need people
to see you with the President.

00:10:03.769 --> 00:10:06.689
There's been no official meeting
with him since the election,

00:10:06.772 --> 00:10:08.316
and people are worried.

00:10:09.025 --> 00:10:11.068
If the President cares
about what people think,

00:10:11.152 --> 00:10:13.446
they have no good reason
to turn down our offer.

00:10:14.864 --> 00:10:15.865
Was it Secretary Shin?

00:10:16.574 --> 00:10:17.491
Pardon?

00:10:17.575 --> 00:10:18.868
Isn't it her plan?

00:10:21.162 --> 00:10:22.204
I apologize.

00:10:23.748 --> 00:10:25.666
She's becoming more and more like her.

00:10:26.459 --> 00:10:27.585
Pardon?

00:10:27.668 --> 00:10:28.711
Nothing.

00:10:29.545 --> 00:10:31.339
It is definitely time for a confrontation.

00:10:31.422 --> 00:10:34.175
Whether it's about Chairman Yang
or the special act,

00:10:34.258 --> 00:10:38.012
at the end of the day,
I'll have to deal with the President.

00:10:39.221 --> 00:10:40.389
Call the Blue House.

00:10:41.599 --> 00:10:43.934
The Chief Secretary
has already been notified

00:10:44.685 --> 00:10:45.811
by Secretary Shin.

00:10:49.982 --> 00:10:51.400
You can head off right now.

00:10:52.068 --> 00:10:53.903
Stop being Secretary Shin's puppet

00:10:54.695 --> 00:10:56.572
unless you want to lose your job too.

00:10:58.949 --> 00:10:59.950
I apologize.

00:11:01.911 --> 00:11:04.538
I told her to look
into a hit-and-run death case.

00:11:04.622 --> 00:11:06.082
I want you to take over.

00:11:06.582 --> 00:11:10.127
It took place on February 26
at 27 Haean-ro, Haseong.

00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:12.880
The victim was Eom Sun-jeong.

00:11:13.589 --> 00:11:14.673
Born in 1982.

00:11:16.967 --> 00:11:18.552
Eom Sun-jeong?

00:11:18.636 --> 00:11:22.556
Isn't that the H Chemical employee
you wanted the contact info for?

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:25.184
How--

00:11:25.267 --> 00:11:26.769
That's what I'm trying to figure out.

00:11:28.354 --> 00:11:31.399
I gave you her contact info.
Have you met her?

00:11:31.482 --> 00:11:33.317
I'm not sure if I can say I met her,

00:11:34.568 --> 00:11:36.112
but I did see her after she passed.

00:11:37.738 --> 00:11:40.032
Right. I'm sorry.

00:11:40.116 --> 00:11:41.784
I shouldn't have asked.

00:11:42.868 --> 00:11:46.122
Check with the police too
and let me know if you find anything.

00:11:46.205 --> 00:11:47.164
Yes, sir.

00:11:54.422 --> 00:11:58.509
Baengnyeong Island, where five people
were killed and eleven remain missing,

00:11:58.592 --> 00:12:00.344
has been declared

00:12:00.428 --> 00:12:04.390
a special disaster zone
as the damage continues to grow.

00:12:04.473 --> 00:12:07.226
A helicopter has been
on standby since five minutes ago.

00:12:08.477 --> 00:12:11.480
The travel route is clear,
and the rain has stopped.

00:12:11.564 --> 00:12:12.648
However,

00:12:13.774 --> 00:12:16.569
President-elect Hyun
has been waiting for an hour.

00:12:16.652 --> 00:12:19.029
He'd like to join you to the flood site.

00:12:19.113 --> 00:12:21.991
Well planned, right?

00:12:22.074 --> 00:12:25.327
President and president-elect
visiting a flood site together.

00:12:25.411 --> 00:12:26.328
Right?

00:12:29.457 --> 00:12:30.416
How shall we proceed?

00:12:30.499 --> 00:12:32.084
Tell him today will be difficult.

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:44.054
Yes, say that to him.

00:12:44.805 --> 00:12:45.681
Yes, sir.

00:12:55.649 --> 00:12:57.985
You didn't need to be so blunt.

00:13:00.779 --> 00:13:02.198
You said you had something to say.

00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:10.080
The Chairman Yang investigation

00:13:10.581 --> 00:13:11.749
should be stopped.

00:13:12.541 --> 00:13:13.667
What are you saying?

00:13:15.419 --> 00:13:18.672
I need something to keep me
from prison when I step down.

00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:22.510
In this country,
former presidents usually end up in jail.

00:13:22.593 --> 00:13:26.263
It wasn't the president-elect who
brought the recorded tape to negotiate,

00:13:26.347 --> 00:13:27.848
saying it was from his late father.

00:13:28.516 --> 00:13:29.934
It was Su-yeon.

00:13:32.186 --> 00:13:34.605
So I postponed the meeting for them.

00:13:34.688 --> 00:13:36.815
I can't be pushed around
like this forever.

00:14:00.214 --> 00:14:01.882
YU JIN-MYEONG
APRIL 4, 2012

00:14:01.966 --> 00:14:05.719
People aren't taking
the H Chemical fire lightly.

00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:10.349
If we leave it like this,
no one can say where the sparks will fly.

00:14:11.016 --> 00:14:13.686
I will handle the police investigation.

00:14:13.769 --> 00:14:15.229
And you--

00:14:28.826 --> 00:14:31.704
You said it'd be a casual tea time,
but the tea looks special.

00:14:34.498 --> 00:14:39.253
Longjing tea is at its best
in taste and color on the third brew.

00:14:39.336 --> 00:14:41.213
On the first and second brew,

00:14:41.297 --> 00:14:44.592
some people find the scent too strong.

00:14:53.309 --> 00:14:55.394
What's wrong? Do you not like it?

00:14:57.521 --> 00:14:59.565
I don't know much about tea.

00:15:05.821 --> 00:15:07.489
I see what you mean.

00:15:07.573 --> 00:15:10.492
The scent is still too strong,
even on the third brew.

00:15:15.122 --> 00:15:17.750
Enough with the tea talk.
Let's get to the point.

00:15:19.376 --> 00:15:22.922
You even brought something from
your late father. It must be important.

00:15:26.926 --> 00:15:28.677
What would happen

00:15:28.761 --> 00:15:32.681
if these words got out to the world?

00:15:32.765 --> 00:15:34.808
Are you threatening me right now?

00:15:34.892 --> 00:15:36.435
I'm giving you a chance

00:15:37.186 --> 00:15:38.395
to protect yourself.

00:15:40.272 --> 00:15:43.859
I won't be the only one going down
if this gets out.

00:15:43.943 --> 00:15:48.614
This will also affect you,
as the direct heiress of Chairman Cha,

00:15:48.697 --> 00:15:51.033
which will affect your husband as well.

00:15:52.242 --> 00:15:54.244
If it's a debt I'll have to pay anyway,

00:15:54.745 --> 00:15:56.205
I might as well pay it now.

00:15:56.288 --> 00:15:58.624
Your political career will be over

00:16:00.292 --> 00:16:02.086
if you reveal this.

00:16:02.586 --> 00:16:04.338
Why die together

00:16:05.798 --> 00:16:07.383
when you can live together?

00:16:07.466 --> 00:16:08.467
This is

00:16:09.134 --> 00:16:10.886
your third presidential run, right?

00:16:12.763 --> 00:16:14.473
If you don't win this one,

00:16:15.766 --> 00:16:17.017
do you think you'll get…

00:16:18.727 --> 00:16:20.104
another chance in five years?

00:16:23.691 --> 00:16:25.943
My husband is young.

00:16:26.026 --> 00:16:29.530
If he falls, he'll get back on his feet,
like he always has.

00:16:30.364 --> 00:16:34.410
Even after five, ten, and 15 years.

00:16:34.493 --> 00:16:39.289
But do you think
it's the same for you, Assemblyman Yu?

00:16:43.711 --> 00:16:46.130
Time is on our side.

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:56.015
This tea.

00:16:57.224 --> 00:16:59.226
I thought its scent was too strong,

00:17:00.436 --> 00:17:03.355
but somehow I'm drawn to the strong scent.

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:09.653
You said you were giving us a chance
to protect ourselves.

00:17:11.196 --> 00:17:14.825
Now, tell us what you want in return.

00:17:25.753 --> 00:17:27.296
There can't be a copy, right?

00:17:27.379 --> 00:17:29.590
She said
if we have the investigation stopped,

00:17:30.591 --> 00:17:33.260
it won't be brought up again.

00:17:36.138 --> 00:17:37.431
Finally, it's over.

00:17:38.515 --> 00:17:42.311
The fishbone that's been stuck
in my throat for all five years of my term

00:17:42.895 --> 00:17:44.104
is finally out.

00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:48.525
I feel so bad for Su-yeon.

00:17:50.402 --> 00:17:51.904
Her mother took her own life

00:17:51.987 --> 00:17:54.364
over a scandal
involving her illegitimate child.

00:17:54.448 --> 00:17:58.494
Her father became her political enemy
and then suddenly died,

00:17:58.577 --> 00:17:59.703
as if

00:18:00.329 --> 00:18:03.290
he was urgently paying off the old debt.

00:18:05.292 --> 00:18:07.211
She's a hurt kid.

00:18:08.253 --> 00:18:11.673
And someone like that
doesn't hesitate to hurt others.

00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:15.677
Do you think
this is really the original copy?

00:18:16.178 --> 00:18:17.137
Is this really it?

00:18:22.434 --> 00:18:23.936
She's a dangerous person.

00:18:24.019 --> 00:18:26.647
She can be neither a friend
nor an enemy to us.

00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:29.149
That's why we started
investigating Chairman Yang.

00:18:29.858 --> 00:18:32.444
We must have something on her too
to protect ourselves.

00:18:32.528 --> 00:18:35.447
As long as we're carrying a sword,
we'll be her enemy.

00:18:35.531 --> 00:18:37.282
It's not a sword. It's a shield.

00:18:37.366 --> 00:18:39.618
It's a sword if it's a sword to her.

00:18:39.701 --> 00:18:41.245
What do you want me to do?

00:18:41.328 --> 00:18:43.455
A sword or a shield, it's been drawn.

00:18:44.373 --> 00:18:45.457
A sword

00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:49.586
is more threatening
when it's in its sheath.

00:18:55.592 --> 00:18:57.678
Put that sword back in

00:18:58.595 --> 00:19:00.180
and give Su-yeon a chance.

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:04.852
The president-elect isn't the one
who'll guarantee our safety.

00:19:05.686 --> 00:19:06.728
It's her.

00:19:27.374 --> 00:19:29.084
The investigation into Chairman Yang

00:19:30.752 --> 00:19:32.880
wasn't due to the special act?

00:19:36.133 --> 00:19:39.219
The investigation is
indeed a sort of bill,

00:19:40.554 --> 00:19:42.890
but we've already been paid

00:19:42.973 --> 00:19:44.141
for that bill.

00:19:44.808 --> 00:19:46.727
It has nothing to do with the special act.

00:19:47.686 --> 00:19:49.688
An investigation can make
anyone look guilty.

00:19:50.939 --> 00:19:52.399
President Yu wouldn't do that.

00:19:52.482 --> 00:19:53.567
How do you know?

00:19:54.902 --> 00:19:56.236
Trust me.

00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:58.280
He would never do that.

00:19:58.363 --> 00:20:00.240
That's why my wife was so sure

00:20:00.324 --> 00:20:02.701
that the President wouldn't do that.

00:20:05.829 --> 00:20:08.207
Who do you think

00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:11.251
shattered the party's unified position
in an instant?

00:20:11.335 --> 00:20:12.711
It was

00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:15.005
your wife.

00:20:16.715 --> 00:20:19.009
The first thing you did as a president

00:20:19.092 --> 00:20:20.636
was the Do Tae-hun Special Act.

00:20:20.719 --> 00:20:22.387
Was that the first thing you had to do?

00:20:22.471 --> 00:20:24.556
You can give up on the special act.

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:26.391
As if it never happened.

00:20:26.475 --> 00:20:28.268
Is that so important?

00:20:28.352 --> 00:20:29.436
More important than me?

00:20:29.519 --> 00:20:31.772
Is it more important than our marriage?

00:20:31.855 --> 00:20:33.190
This time,

00:20:33.273 --> 00:20:34.650
it will be you.

00:20:38.278 --> 00:20:40.906
Is the person
who has been blocking the special act…

00:20:44.701 --> 00:20:45.911
my wife?

00:20:53.377 --> 00:20:54.628
Didn't you know?

00:20:57.839 --> 00:21:00.634
Then why were you trying to divorce her?

00:21:00.717 --> 00:21:03.887
Wasn't it to pass the special act?

00:21:06.556 --> 00:21:09.935
Was it to protect Su-yeon?

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:15.482
Because you thought we were investigating
Chairman Yang to stop the special act?

00:21:19.403 --> 00:21:21.363
What deal did you make with my wife?

00:21:24.241 --> 00:21:26.743
I'm sorry, but I can't be of help.

00:21:29.538 --> 00:21:33.333
It's still not too late to drop the suit.

00:21:34.209 --> 00:21:35.836
You can't protect

00:21:36.878 --> 00:21:38.880
both Su-yeon and the special act.

00:21:40.090 --> 00:21:42.426
You should let go of one of them.

00:22:15.876 --> 00:22:18.754
THE 23RD PRESIDENT HYUN MIN-CHEOL

00:22:25.927 --> 00:22:26.970
Su-yeon.

00:22:27.054 --> 00:22:30.015
What deal did you make
with President Yu five years ago?

00:22:31.892 --> 00:22:33.560
Is that why you called?

00:22:34.061 --> 00:22:36.438
I heard you're the one
blocking the special act.

00:22:37.105 --> 00:22:38.690
You, not the President.

00:22:40.275 --> 00:22:41.359
Is that true?

00:22:43.153 --> 00:22:45.322
This isn't something
to be talked about over the phone.

00:22:45.405 --> 00:22:47.574
We're supposed to be fighting in court.

00:22:47.657 --> 00:22:49.034
The First Lady says

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:51.620
that I can't protect

00:22:52.871 --> 00:22:54.456
both you and the special act.

00:22:54.539 --> 00:22:55.832
So?

00:22:55.916 --> 00:22:57.209
Did you make a choice?

00:22:58.335 --> 00:22:59.628
What are you protecting?

00:23:01.254 --> 00:23:03.340
Me or Do Tae-hun?

00:23:03.423 --> 00:23:05.258
What would you do if you were me?

00:23:07.594 --> 00:23:09.012
Who would you choose?

00:23:09.679 --> 00:23:11.515
I already made my choice.

00:23:14.017 --> 00:23:15.268
I've got to go.

00:23:48.135 --> 00:23:49.136
Sir?

00:23:57.769 --> 00:23:58.603
Sir!

00:24:01.189 --> 00:24:03.275
Where are you going?

00:24:03.358 --> 00:24:04.401
I just…

00:24:06.611 --> 00:24:08.113
want to walk for a bit.

00:24:08.196 --> 00:24:10.073
It's too dangerous like this.

00:24:10.157 --> 00:24:11.491
Our security regulations--

00:24:11.575 --> 00:24:13.910
Hold on. If I shouldn't walk around,

00:24:15.537 --> 00:24:16.705
let me just…

00:24:18.456 --> 00:24:19.749
stay here like this.

00:24:22.252 --> 00:24:24.337
Please, do that, sir.

00:24:25.881 --> 00:24:27.132
Can I

00:24:27.215 --> 00:24:29.009
hold this for a moment?

00:24:29.509 --> 00:24:31.344
-But--
-I just realized that

00:24:32.637 --> 00:24:35.473
it's been a while
since I held an umbrella in the rain.

00:24:38.018 --> 00:24:39.102
Yes, sir.

00:25:16.264 --> 00:25:19.184
Hello. Please vote for
candidate number three, Hyun Min-cheol.

00:25:19.267 --> 00:25:21.144
Hi, I'm Candidate Hyun Min-cheol.

00:25:59.683 --> 00:26:01.268
WE PROMISE SINCERITY!

00:26:01.351 --> 00:26:03.561
Kang Seon-ho is family of the victim?

00:26:03.645 --> 00:26:04.896
Yes.

00:26:05.939 --> 00:26:07.983
I even double-checked.

00:26:16.283 --> 00:26:19.244
Both of Kang's parents
were working for H Chemical.

00:26:19.744 --> 00:26:21.955
After they died in the plant fire,

00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:24.457
he was raised in an orphanage.

00:26:26.418 --> 00:26:29.170
I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE
WHAT HAPPENED THAT DAY…

00:26:29.754 --> 00:26:32.132
"Punishment is not what we want."

00:26:32.215 --> 00:26:34.676
"We want our family back."

00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:37.679
"Revenge is not what I want."

00:26:38.388 --> 00:26:42.600
"I want my mom and dad, who left
saying, 'I'll see you later,' that day

00:26:42.684 --> 00:26:45.020
to come back home."

00:26:46.229 --> 00:26:49.065
It's Kang's eulogy
from the memorial service in 2012.

00:26:49.149 --> 00:26:50.650
He was in middle school then.

00:26:52.986 --> 00:26:54.779
And Ms. Cha missed this?

00:26:55.405 --> 00:26:56.614
That's very unlikely.

00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:01.119
When Kang met Ms. Cha for the first time,

00:27:01.202 --> 00:27:03.079
he was Yoon Ki-ju's attorney.

00:27:04.581 --> 00:27:06.958
He lost his parents in the fire,

00:27:07.959 --> 00:27:09.919
and he defended Yoon Ki-ju,

00:27:10.003 --> 00:27:12.839
who was supporting
the suspected arsonist Do Tae-hun?

00:27:13.423 --> 00:27:15.091
And that Kang Seon-ho is

00:27:15.717 --> 00:27:17.886
defending Ms. Cha now?

00:27:17.969 --> 00:27:21.389
What we know for sure is
that he's the only person who submitted

00:27:21.890 --> 00:27:22.932
the power of attorney.

00:27:23.933 --> 00:27:26.770
He's not just a lawyer.
He's a divorce lawyer who will

00:27:27.437 --> 00:27:29.898
have access
to all kinds of personal information.

00:27:30.482 --> 00:27:31.858
So why…

00:27:31.941 --> 00:27:34.778
It needs to be framed
as an accident, not a disaster.

00:27:35.445 --> 00:27:38.865
If the responsibility falls on him too,
it'll be hard to handle.

00:27:43.203 --> 00:27:44.621
Actually, no.

00:27:44.704 --> 00:27:46.247
Let's not make it an accident.

00:27:46.831 --> 00:27:50.585
Let's make it look like
the protesters started the blaze.

00:27:50.668 --> 00:27:52.921
So the contract worker issue
gets sidetracked.

00:27:53.004 --> 00:27:56.341
We need a specific target,
not just a group of laborers.

00:28:00.762 --> 00:28:01.930
Do Tae-hun…

00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:03.890
Has he been found yet?

00:28:03.973 --> 00:28:05.975
It's been two days already.

00:28:06.851 --> 00:28:09.229
They're still searching,

00:28:09.854 --> 00:28:11.606
but the chance that he's alive is…

00:28:13.316 --> 00:28:17.946
Plant a story in the press that
Do Tae-hun instructed to block the police.

00:28:20.448 --> 00:28:22.659
Is that really necessary?

00:28:22.742 --> 00:28:26.162
It's a fact that he occupied
the plant with the union members.

00:28:27.622 --> 00:28:29.874
But the fire wasn't his doing.

00:28:29.958 --> 00:28:32.710
We need to know the cause of fire
to know the truth.

00:28:32.794 --> 00:28:35.755
It'll take at least a few months
to get the results.

00:28:36.256 --> 00:28:40.093
We need a target for people to focus on
to distract public attention.

00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:43.096
If we don't do anything…

00:28:50.812 --> 00:28:52.480
he will be framed for everything.

00:28:54.190 --> 00:28:55.775
-But still--
-A man has died.

00:28:56.818 --> 00:28:58.445
Someone should take the fall.

00:28:58.528 --> 00:29:02.282
But Mr. Hyun saved people from the fire.

00:29:02.365 --> 00:29:05.368
People see him as a hero,
and public sentiment is on his side.

00:29:05.452 --> 00:29:07.162
Public sentiment is like the wind.

00:29:08.163 --> 00:29:10.957
You never know where it will blow next.

00:29:13.084 --> 00:29:14.919
The election is in one week.

00:29:15.003 --> 00:29:17.213
Cha Jeong-yeon won't
just sit back and watch.

00:29:17.297 --> 00:29:20.300
He'll try everything
to turn public opinion around.

00:29:21.718 --> 00:29:24.220
If he starts to be blamed
for someone's death,

00:29:24.804 --> 00:29:26.347
he'll be done in politics,

00:29:26.431 --> 00:29:28.349
let alone win the election.

00:29:30.226 --> 00:29:32.771
Haseong isn't just an electoral district.

00:29:33.354 --> 00:29:36.691
It's the base of Cha Jin-taek,
the Election Committee Chief.

00:29:36.775 --> 00:29:39.819
Losing Haseong means
losing the rest of the districts.

00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:44.032
There was already controversy
about the hereditary nomination,

00:29:44.115 --> 00:29:45.992
but Father pushed through it anyway.

00:29:46.659 --> 00:29:50.246
He bet his shot at the presidency
on Haseong.

00:29:50.330 --> 00:29:54.918
But nobody knows
what the fire incident will lead to yet.

00:29:55.001 --> 00:29:56.461
That's exactly the problem.

00:29:57.879 --> 00:30:01.549
The entire Party for Peace and Freedom,
not just Cha Jeong-yeon,

00:30:01.633 --> 00:30:04.552
will do everything they can to blame him

00:30:04.636 --> 00:30:06.429
for the fire.

00:30:07.514 --> 00:30:08.556
Even so…

00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:09.808
For now,

00:30:09.891 --> 00:30:12.393
he must become the one who's been wronged.

00:30:12.477 --> 00:30:15.480
Do everything you can,
including pretending to be a victim.

00:30:17.398 --> 00:30:18.650
If the public

00:30:19.359 --> 00:30:21.486
views him as the perpetrator,

00:30:23.571 --> 00:30:25.073
we can't turn that around.

00:30:29.494 --> 00:30:31.454
Tae-hun is what?

00:30:31.538 --> 00:30:32.622
An arsonist?

00:30:32.705 --> 00:30:34.165
A murderer?

00:30:34.249 --> 00:30:35.708
We're in a hospital.

00:30:35.792 --> 00:30:37.502
Candidate Hyun is a patient.

00:30:38.127 --> 00:30:39.254
He needs rest.

00:30:39.337 --> 00:30:41.172
You frame Tae-hun as an arsonist

00:30:41.798 --> 00:30:43.508
when we don't know if he's alive.

00:30:44.425 --> 00:30:46.427
Patient? Rest?

00:30:46.511 --> 00:30:49.389
-Move.
-Ki-ju, hold yourself back.

00:30:49.472 --> 00:30:50.765
Don't act like this here.

00:30:50.849 --> 00:30:51.891
Mom.

00:30:52.475 --> 00:30:55.353
They do this because we always hold back.

00:30:55.937 --> 00:30:57.939
This is why we always get played!

00:30:58.022 --> 00:31:00.233
They don't deserve your time.

00:31:00.316 --> 00:31:01.776
Find someone better to deal with.

00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:05.280
What if you jinx Tae-hun by doing this?

00:31:05.363 --> 00:31:08.408
What if something bad happens to him
because of that?

00:31:08.491 --> 00:31:10.702
Something bad has already happened!

00:31:10.785 --> 00:31:13.413
Can't you tell
from all the stuff they're doing?

00:31:14.956 --> 00:31:15.957
Min-cheol that scum

00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:18.459
wants to become the hero
to win the election.

00:31:18.543 --> 00:31:21.212
It's bad enough that Tae-hun died,

00:31:21.713 --> 00:31:23.756
and now they're making him a murderer!

00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:25.675
Who's dead?

00:31:25.758 --> 00:31:27.010
Tae-hun is alive.

00:31:27.093 --> 00:31:30.013
He's very much alive.
Why would you say he's dead?

00:31:30.763 --> 00:31:32.515
Mom, I'm sorry.

00:31:33.057 --> 00:31:34.350
I'm sorry,

00:31:35.602 --> 00:31:36.895
but if nothing changes,

00:31:38.104 --> 00:31:39.689
even if he comes back alive,

00:31:40.398 --> 00:31:41.858
he won't be living.

00:31:41.941 --> 00:31:46.070
He'll be branded a murderer who killed
his coworkers. He won't be living.

00:31:46.154 --> 00:31:48.656
He's alive.

00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:50.867
My Tae-hun is alive.

00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:52.702
Can't you hear his voice?

00:31:52.785 --> 00:31:54.203
"Mom, save me."

00:31:54.287 --> 00:31:56.205
Can't you hear that?

00:31:56.289 --> 00:31:57.874
What are you doing here?

00:31:57.957 --> 00:31:59.292
You can't be here.

00:31:59.375 --> 00:32:00.919
What wrong did Tae-hun do?

00:32:01.461 --> 00:32:03.421
Why must he be called a murderer
in his death?

00:32:04.297 --> 00:32:06.174
Do you think I don't know

00:32:06.257 --> 00:32:07.967
that it was you guys' doing?

00:32:08.051 --> 00:32:09.177
Let me go.

00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:12.096
Hey, Min-cheol,
did Tae-hun start the fire?

00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:13.723
Is he a murderer?

00:32:13.806 --> 00:32:15.975
Come out and speak for yourself.

00:32:16.059 --> 00:32:17.477
I know you can hear me!

00:32:18.269 --> 00:32:21.397
Hyun Min-cheol!
You come out and explain yourself!

00:32:21.481 --> 00:32:22.357
Let me go!

00:32:24.943 --> 00:32:27.946
You're saying Ms. Cha manipulated
public opinion on the fire?

00:32:28.029 --> 00:32:29.322
There's no proof.

00:32:30.114 --> 00:32:32.367
It is just Yoon Ki-ju's one-sided claim.

00:32:32.951 --> 00:32:36.829
But it's more than possible
that Kang Seon-ho believes him.

00:32:36.913 --> 00:32:40.208
The press reports
and the investigation reports matched.

00:32:40.291 --> 00:32:41.960
The court also decided that

00:32:42.043 --> 00:32:44.504
Do Tae-hun's paint thinner
caused the fire.

00:32:44.587 --> 00:32:47.006
Back then, it brought upon public outrage

00:32:47.090 --> 00:32:51.344
that Do Tae-hun started the fire
and drove his coworkers to an early grave.

00:32:51.427 --> 00:32:53.388
It couldn't have been a lie.

00:32:53.471 --> 00:32:55.223
Forget it. What's important now is

00:32:56.099 --> 00:32:58.601
why Kang Seon-ho decided
to take on the divorce case.

00:33:02.981 --> 00:33:04.649
Are there more secrets I don't know?

00:33:06.985 --> 00:33:10.238
Is Ms. Cha involved
in Chairman Yang's illegal succession too?

00:33:12.657 --> 00:33:13.950
Who knows?

00:33:14.701 --> 00:33:16.327
One thing I'm sure of is,

00:33:16.411 --> 00:33:20.707
those secrets piled up one after another
and made President-elect who he is today.

00:33:21.416 --> 00:33:24.877
And those secrets are
threatening him right now.

00:33:24.961 --> 00:33:26.004
Just like the affair.

00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:31.968
Is the affair

00:33:32.802 --> 00:33:33.886
true?

00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:39.559
If Ms. Cha misunderstood,

00:33:39.642 --> 00:33:41.144
others would too.

00:33:41.227 --> 00:33:42.520
Misunderstanding or not,

00:33:42.603 --> 00:33:45.481
I can't possibly know
what happened before I joined.

00:33:46.858 --> 00:33:49.068
Honestly, I don't want to know.

00:33:50.361 --> 00:33:52.321
But the affair is a different matter.

00:33:52.405 --> 00:33:54.782
President-elect is
involved in a lawsuit over it.

00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:57.285
Others don't have to know,

00:33:57.785 --> 00:33:59.620
but I must in order to deal with it.

00:34:01.956 --> 00:34:02.957
Secretary Shin.

00:34:03.541 --> 00:34:05.585
She declared a countersuit.

00:34:06.794 --> 00:34:10.131
She said she'd demonstrate
the proof of his affair in court.

00:34:11.507 --> 00:34:13.217
What proof could that be?

00:34:14.427 --> 00:34:15.428
I can easily guess.

00:34:15.511 --> 00:34:18.890
The messages they exchanged
or the call logs.

00:34:18.973 --> 00:34:20.099
Something like that.

00:34:20.850 --> 00:34:23.978
If not, photos or videos.

00:34:26.773 --> 00:34:28.357
Both Ms. Cha and Ji-yu

00:34:28.858 --> 00:34:30.526
seemed to suspect Lee Hwa-jin.

00:34:31.402 --> 00:34:32.487
Who?

00:34:33.071 --> 00:34:34.363
The stylist?

00:34:34.989 --> 00:34:35.990
No way.

00:34:39.368 --> 00:34:40.369
Seriously?

00:34:40.953 --> 00:34:42.789
She'll think people will suspect her

00:34:42.872 --> 00:34:45.583
just like how she suspected her.

00:34:45.666 --> 00:34:47.710
If so, she'll point fingers
at Lee Hwa-jin.

00:34:48.294 --> 00:34:52.507
We can claim that messages and videos
were fabricated,

00:34:52.590 --> 00:34:54.759
but you can't fake a person.

00:34:56.344 --> 00:34:58.262
So it's all up to what Hwa-jin says.

00:34:59.722 --> 00:35:00.640
What do we do then?

00:35:00.723 --> 00:35:02.558
I'll deal with Lee Hwa-jin.

00:35:03.142 --> 00:35:04.936
Find out more about Kang Seon-ho.

00:35:11.109 --> 00:35:13.152
Where there's smoke, there's fire.

00:35:13.236 --> 00:35:16.197
If she claims he's had an affair,
he really must've.

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:18.991
When President-elect first said
that he'd divorce her,

00:35:19.075 --> 00:35:20.368
people called it a purge.

00:35:20.952 --> 00:35:23.287
That he was getting rid
of a major contributor.

00:35:23.371 --> 00:35:24.705
Everyone said

00:35:24.789 --> 00:35:27.416
the president-elect and his wife
were fighting

00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:29.961
over power which cannot be shared.

00:35:30.044 --> 00:35:32.130
People said even worse things.

00:35:32.213 --> 00:35:35.007
She was both a major contributor
and a faithful wife.

00:35:35.091 --> 00:35:37.635
But now I can see that's not the problem.

00:35:37.718 --> 00:35:40.847
Seeing how wiretapping, affair,
and countersuit are involved,

00:35:40.930 --> 00:35:43.307
this is a war of love.

00:35:44.684 --> 00:35:47.145
The special act and grand coalition
are buried,

00:35:47.770 --> 00:35:49.856
and everyone's attention
is on the divorce.

00:35:51.774 --> 00:35:53.442
What will happen to us now?

00:35:54.110 --> 00:35:55.236
Gosh, Secretary Lee.

00:35:56.195 --> 00:35:58.948
-Well, we'll get back to work now.
-Sir.

00:35:59.031 --> 00:36:00.199
Join me and smoke.

00:36:05.913 --> 00:36:08.291
Where there's smoke, there's fire.

00:36:08.374 --> 00:36:11.252
If she claims he's had an affair,
he really must've.

00:36:11.335 --> 00:36:12.461
It can't be, right?

00:36:13.671 --> 00:36:14.839
It can't be.

00:36:20.428 --> 00:36:21.554
Lee Hwa-jin.

00:36:23.681 --> 00:36:24.891
Lee Hwa-jin.

00:36:26.517 --> 00:36:27.727
Lee Hwa-jin.

00:36:28.311 --> 00:36:29.520
Who is it?

00:36:33.983 --> 00:36:36.110
Secretary Shin, what brings you here?

00:36:42.950 --> 00:36:45.453
Where's Hwa-jin? She won't pick up.

00:36:46.621 --> 00:36:47.705
Well…

00:37:09.435 --> 00:37:10.770
Why're you looking for her?

00:37:12.271 --> 00:37:14.690
It's urgent. Where is she?

00:37:15.233 --> 00:37:17.193
I wouldn't know. She's not a child.

00:37:19.362 --> 00:37:22.114
After what happened to Ms. Cha,
I lost my subscribers.

00:37:22.198 --> 00:37:23.991
I couldn't livestream anything.

00:37:24.075 --> 00:37:26.369
They demanded that I return the donations.

00:37:26.911 --> 00:37:29.080
But they didn't really give me much.

00:37:31.123 --> 00:37:32.124
After the funeral,

00:37:32.208 --> 00:37:35.419
we packed our stuff,
thinking we should just go on a trip,

00:37:35.503 --> 00:37:37.797
but she suddenly left for a part-time job.

00:37:38.631 --> 00:37:39.548
A part-time job?

00:37:40.341 --> 00:37:43.177
She said accommodation would be provided.

00:37:49.725 --> 00:37:51.686
DANGER
FOG AREA

00:38:19.422 --> 00:38:21.424
LOOKING FOR A WITNESS
TO A HIT-AND-RUN CRASH

00:38:32.893 --> 00:38:34.562
Mom.

00:38:37.606 --> 00:38:39.400
Dad.

00:38:42.570 --> 00:38:44.238
Mom.

00:39:47.593 --> 00:39:54.183
OCCURRED ON 27 HAEAN-RO
AT AROUND 5 P.M. ON FEBRUARY, 2027

00:40:05.986 --> 00:40:07.530
Just a second.

00:40:12.410 --> 00:40:15.663
Yes, I was waiting for your call.

00:40:15.746 --> 00:40:17.039
So,

00:40:17.123 --> 00:40:19.375
did you think about my offer?

00:40:20.418 --> 00:40:21.669
I'm still considering.

00:40:21.752 --> 00:40:25.131
What? But we don't have much time left.

00:40:25.214 --> 00:40:26.590
I know, I get it.

00:40:26.674 --> 00:40:28.843
But I called to ask something else.

00:40:28.926 --> 00:40:32.096
I heard my wife hired someone to bug me.

00:40:32.179 --> 00:40:33.639
And it was you

00:40:34.348 --> 00:40:35.891
who provided that information.

00:40:35.975 --> 00:40:37.601
Oh, that…

00:40:38.310 --> 00:40:40.771
Can we talk about it
through Secretary Shin?

00:40:40.855 --> 00:40:42.565
I feel very uncomfortable

00:40:43.441 --> 00:40:45.109
talking about it directly.

00:40:45.192 --> 00:40:46.360
Secretary Shin quit.

00:40:49.655 --> 00:40:50.781
I see.

00:40:50.865 --> 00:40:52.575
I wish to meet that person.

00:40:57.913 --> 00:40:59.290
Ms. Cha, I'm back.

00:40:59.373 --> 00:41:00.416
Have a look.

00:41:02.001 --> 00:41:03.836
-Ms. Cha.
-Ms. Cha.

00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:05.463
How is this car?

00:41:05.546 --> 00:41:07.047
She looks so beautiful today.

00:41:07.131 --> 00:41:09.216
I prefer the previous car.

00:41:10.384 --> 00:41:12.845
I scrapped that car.

00:41:13.846 --> 00:41:16.265
It would've cost more to repair it.

00:41:16.348 --> 00:41:17.850
Might as well get a new car.

00:41:17.933 --> 00:41:20.561
You've driven that car
for almost 20 years.

00:41:21.770 --> 00:41:25.024
I felt so bad
that I'd been so inattentive to you.

00:41:31.572 --> 00:41:33.741
Then I will…

00:41:34.825 --> 00:41:36.619
take the smaller one.

00:41:37.620 --> 00:41:40.372
But I want to buy you the bigger car.

00:41:40.456 --> 00:41:42.917
So I can borrow it from time to time.

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:44.668
And when Ji-yu gets her license,

00:41:44.752 --> 00:41:46.879
you can help her with driving practice.

00:41:47.963 --> 00:41:49.965
I learned how to drive from you too.

00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:52.510
Speaking of which,

00:41:53.761 --> 00:41:56.096
I learned everything from you.

00:41:59.934 --> 00:42:03.020
This small car is perfect
for teaching Ji-yu.

00:42:03.103 --> 00:42:05.481
I'll feel more at ease when I teach her.

00:42:07.024 --> 00:42:08.943
Then shall we get this?

00:42:09.652 --> 00:42:10.903
I'll choose the color.

00:42:12.154 --> 00:42:14.740
Would yellow be nice like before?

00:42:14.823 --> 00:42:17.701
Red looks nice too. It stands out.

00:42:17.785 --> 00:42:19.036
Ms. Cha.

00:42:19.119 --> 00:42:21.121
-You've gotten prettier.
-So pretty.

00:42:21.205 --> 00:42:22.623
-Ms. Cha.
-Yes?

00:42:24.708 --> 00:42:25.876
Are you all right?

00:42:26.418 --> 00:42:27.294
What do you mean?

00:42:27.378 --> 00:42:30.339
I'm wondering if you're really okay now.

00:42:32.258 --> 00:42:34.843
Are you okay with showing up
in front of the others?

00:42:37.388 --> 00:42:38.597
I'm fine.

00:42:39.890 --> 00:42:43.602
I have to tell myself that
to actually feel all right.

00:42:47.565 --> 00:42:50.401
Don't worry. I'm really fine.

00:42:54.738 --> 00:42:56.949
LIM HYUN-GYO, PARTY FOR PEACE AND FREEDOM

00:42:57.032 --> 00:43:00.369
Oh. Excuse me. I need to take this call.

00:43:01.078 --> 00:43:04.540
Mr. Kim, discuss with her
and decide on the car options.

00:43:04.623 --> 00:43:06.875
You know best about cars.

00:43:06.959 --> 00:43:08.043
Yes, ma'am.

00:43:10.963 --> 00:43:13.173
Check out the car brochure.

00:43:20.806 --> 00:43:22.391
You called right on time.

00:43:23.142 --> 00:43:24.602
Has everyone gathered?

00:43:24.685 --> 00:43:25.603
Yes.

00:43:25.686 --> 00:43:28.814
All the assemblymen you've mentioned
are waiting.

00:43:30.107 --> 00:43:33.193
If everyone is present,
put me on speakerphone.

00:43:33.277 --> 00:43:34.194
Okay.

00:43:35.529 --> 00:43:37.114
You're on. Please speak.

00:43:37.197 --> 00:43:38.407
CHA SU-YEON

00:43:38.490 --> 00:43:39.992
Mr. Noh Cheol-jae.

00:43:40.075 --> 00:43:42.536
Mr. Jo Hyun-seok. Ms. Han Kyung-ae.

00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:46.415
I should visit you three in person,

00:43:46.498 --> 00:43:50.002
but I'm quite busy
preparing for the trial nowadays.

00:43:50.085 --> 00:43:52.212
Even if you're busy,

00:43:52.796 --> 00:43:55.424
why did you gather us here?

00:43:55.507 --> 00:43:57.760
Over a phone, at that.

00:43:57.843 --> 00:43:59.720
You three seemed to spend

00:43:59.803 --> 00:44:02.556
a lot of time with Mr. Lim recently,

00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:05.142
so I thought I should inform you
via a phone call

00:44:05.225 --> 00:44:06.935
to clear up any misunderstanding.

00:44:09.688 --> 00:44:11.398
Let's hear you out.

00:44:11.482 --> 00:44:13.484
What do you want?

00:44:13.567 --> 00:44:16.862
As the key assemblymen of your party,

00:44:16.945 --> 00:44:19.823
you three got the party together
to stop the special act.

00:44:19.907 --> 00:44:20.991
Thank you.

00:44:23.243 --> 00:44:26.455
But this will be the last time
I communicate with you

00:44:26.538 --> 00:44:27.873
through Mr. Lim.

00:44:31.293 --> 00:44:34.171
What… Hold on a second, Ms. Cha.

00:44:34.755 --> 00:44:36.799
What are you saying?

00:44:36.882 --> 00:44:38.008
You don't get it?

00:44:38.634 --> 00:44:40.386
Lim Hyun-gyo,

00:44:40.469 --> 00:44:41.679
you're out.

00:44:45.974 --> 00:44:47.851
I asked you to unite the party.

00:44:47.935 --> 00:44:50.187
I didn't ask you to do your own politics,

00:44:50.270 --> 00:44:52.231
nominations and elections and whatnot.

00:44:53.065 --> 00:44:54.108
Ms. Cha.

00:44:55.526 --> 00:44:57.486
You're going too far.

00:44:58.028 --> 00:45:00.197
I didn't do that.
On what grounds are you--

00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:04.159
Assemblyman Jo and Assemblywoman Han
were very concerned.

00:45:04.243 --> 00:45:06.161
They weren't sure if you had

00:45:06.245 --> 00:45:08.622
Party for Peace and Freedom's interest
as your priority.

00:45:12.584 --> 00:45:14.294
I know it'll be a hassle,

00:45:14.378 --> 00:45:17.005
but I want Party Leader Noh
to represent me from now on.

00:45:17.089 --> 00:45:18.966
Keep in touch with me directly.

00:45:22.970 --> 00:45:24.054
I am

00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:26.140
the leader of the opposition party.

00:45:26.807 --> 00:45:29.560
It could become problematic
if we communicated directly.

00:45:31.353 --> 00:45:33.063
All three of you

00:45:33.647 --> 00:45:36.859
were handpicked by my late father.

00:45:36.942 --> 00:45:40.112
You've worked with me
for a very long time.

00:45:40.737 --> 00:45:44.241
We may be in different parties now,

00:45:44.324 --> 00:45:46.994
but all of you are like family to me.

00:45:47.077 --> 00:45:50.789
In particular, Mr. Noh.
Even when we were up against each other

00:45:50.873 --> 00:45:52.458
for the Presidential election,

00:45:52.541 --> 00:45:54.960
you gave me good advice as my mentor.

00:45:55.544 --> 00:45:58.547
Even when you were
the leader of your party.

00:46:00.632 --> 00:46:02.050
That's because

00:46:02.634 --> 00:46:05.721
before we're political enemies,

00:46:05.804 --> 00:46:08.891
we're like family, as you said.

00:46:10.184 --> 00:46:11.560
Exactly.

00:46:11.643 --> 00:46:14.271
So it won't be an issue at all.

00:46:15.189 --> 00:46:16.148
Well…

00:46:17.024 --> 00:46:18.525
If you say so,

00:46:19.359 --> 00:46:20.486
I have no choice.

00:46:20.569 --> 00:46:23.071
Then I'll entrust it to you.

00:46:23.155 --> 00:46:26.408
Wait, Ms. Cha. Ms. Cha, hello? Ms…

00:46:26.492 --> 00:46:27.826
Damn it.

00:46:27.910 --> 00:46:30.329
Wait, Mr. Jo.

00:46:30.412 --> 00:46:31.413
Mr. Noh.

00:46:32.539 --> 00:46:33.582
Mr. Noh!

00:46:45.802 --> 00:46:46.678
Ms. Cha!

00:46:46.762 --> 00:46:49.640
Over here.

00:46:49.723 --> 00:46:51.475
Why isn't she looking at us?

00:46:51.558 --> 00:46:52.976
You haven't decided yet?

00:46:54.144 --> 00:46:56.813
There are so many options
that it's confusing.

00:46:56.897 --> 00:46:59.775
Technology has improved,
but it's become more complex.

00:46:59.858 --> 00:47:01.652
Then just choose all.

00:47:02.778 --> 00:47:04.780
Pardon? You should remove what you can.

00:47:04.863 --> 00:47:07.449
When it's complicated,
make a simple choice.

00:47:07.533 --> 00:47:08.534
I've decided.

00:47:08.617 --> 00:47:10.285
Then I'll help you with the contract.

00:47:10.369 --> 00:47:12.037
-Let's do it inside.
-Okay.

00:47:14.873 --> 00:47:16.583
-She's going in now.
-Oh, no.

00:47:17.668 --> 00:47:20.254
-Already?
-She's going in.

00:47:32.891 --> 00:47:33.767
Shall we leave too?

00:47:34.810 --> 00:47:37.312
-Yes. Goodness.
-Let's go.

00:47:56.331 --> 00:47:57.374
What is it?

00:47:58.041 --> 00:47:59.126
I just need a moment.

00:47:59.209 --> 00:48:01.336
Our security regulation says--

00:48:01.420 --> 00:48:04.506
I asked you to overlook
those regulations for a while.

00:48:04.590 --> 00:48:07.759
But you'll be too noticeable this way.
It's dangerous.

00:48:09.970 --> 00:48:11.054
If you must go out,

00:48:13.974 --> 00:48:15.309
wear this at least.

00:48:19.062 --> 00:48:20.063
Hold on.

00:48:20.147 --> 00:48:22.357
Just a cap might make you stand out more.

00:48:36.121 --> 00:48:37.539
STORE UP FOR SALE

00:48:37.623 --> 00:48:39.416
Why? Is the business doing poorly?

00:48:40.542 --> 00:48:42.711
Don't even get me started.

00:48:42.794 --> 00:48:44.588
It's absolutely terrible.

00:48:45.339 --> 00:48:48.675
So what if we have the new president?

00:48:48.759 --> 00:48:51.261
The economy is dried up and dying.

00:48:51.845 --> 00:48:54.473
Gosh, I'm dying too.

00:48:54.556 --> 00:48:55.849
What do you need?

00:48:58.226 --> 00:48:59.061
Goodness.

00:48:59.895 --> 00:49:01.063
Mr. President?

00:49:02.397 --> 00:49:03.899
You didn't pick up my calls.

00:49:03.982 --> 00:49:06.860
Yes, well…

00:49:06.943 --> 00:49:09.863
Right, I don't pick up calls
from unknown numbers.

00:49:12.491 --> 00:49:15.077
Are you here to take him away in secret?

00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:16.787
That's not it.

00:49:16.870 --> 00:49:18.997
He did nothing wrong.

00:49:19.081 --> 00:49:20.832
He just did as he was told.

00:49:20.916 --> 00:49:22.751
I said that wasn't the case.

00:49:24.211 --> 00:49:26.213
I'm not here to do that. Let's talk.

00:49:26.296 --> 00:49:28.382
What? Sure, come in.

00:49:28.465 --> 00:49:30.092
Honey, stand back.

00:49:30.175 --> 00:49:31.551
This way, please.

00:49:32.344 --> 00:49:34.096
Go in.

00:49:45.774 --> 00:49:48.985
This… You're not
going to have it, are you?

00:49:50.654 --> 00:49:52.614
Okay, then I'll take it.

00:49:55.283 --> 00:49:56.910
I'll gain weight if I eat this.

00:49:56.993 --> 00:49:58.954
But it's buy one get one free.

00:49:59.037 --> 00:50:03.375
I'd rather put on weight
than let it melt and throw it away.

00:50:04.042 --> 00:50:07.087
Oh, what was I talking about?

00:50:07.170 --> 00:50:09.005
My mind is all over the place.

00:50:09.798 --> 00:50:12.092
That my wife hired you to bug me.

00:50:12.175 --> 00:50:14.177
Yes, that's right.

00:50:14.261 --> 00:50:16.555
But I have nothing else to say about that.

00:50:16.638 --> 00:50:17.597
That was it.

00:50:17.681 --> 00:50:22.102
The device was the type which you had to
collect back to check the recording.

00:50:22.185 --> 00:50:25.689
So I taught Ms. Cha
how to use it once, and that was it.

00:50:26.773 --> 00:50:28.900
So you've never listened to the recording?

00:50:28.984 --> 00:50:30.610
When I first taught her,

00:50:30.694 --> 00:50:33.947
I checked the recording with her.
Just that one time.

00:50:34.030 --> 00:50:35.782
But not after that.

00:50:35.866 --> 00:50:36.992
When was that?

00:50:37.492 --> 00:50:39.703
Exactly when did she start bugging me?

00:50:41.955 --> 00:50:43.623
It was five years ago.

00:50:44.207 --> 00:50:46.543
Five years ago?
Not right after we got married?

00:50:46.626 --> 00:50:50.005
Yes. It was when the news was all about

00:50:50.088 --> 00:50:52.424
whether you'd run for president or not,

00:50:52.507 --> 00:50:53.967
so I remember it clearly.

00:50:54.760 --> 00:50:57.679
But I did find it a bit strange.

00:50:57.763 --> 00:50:58.805
Five years ago,

00:50:58.889 --> 00:51:02.642
people used the devices that allowed you
to wiretap real-time using Wi-Fi.

00:51:02.726 --> 00:51:06.146
But she specifically asked
for an older model

00:51:06.229 --> 00:51:09.983
which she had to retrieve
to check the recording.

00:51:10.066 --> 00:51:15.071
I had a very hard time
getting my hands on one back then.

00:51:15.155 --> 00:51:17.073
Was that the only job you did for her?

00:51:17.157 --> 00:51:18.158
Yes, that was it.

00:51:18.241 --> 00:51:20.952
Nothing else, I swear.

00:51:21.036 --> 00:51:22.287
One more thing.

00:51:22.871 --> 00:51:25.874
Why did you sell this information
about my wife to Candidate Bae?

00:51:28.877 --> 00:51:30.128
I'm very sorry.

00:51:31.087 --> 00:51:34.591
I needed more money to open this store.

00:51:34.674 --> 00:51:36.760
My question is, why Candidate Bae?

00:51:37.677 --> 00:51:41.556
There's the media, and you could
strike a deal directly with my wife.

00:51:42.140 --> 00:51:45.977
Well, the media make all the noises,
but nothing actually gets done.

00:51:46.061 --> 00:51:49.064
And Ms. Cha doesn't strike any deals
to begin with.

00:51:49.815 --> 00:51:50.941
That's right.

00:51:51.024 --> 00:51:52.984
You seem to know her better than I.

00:51:54.152 --> 00:51:55.070
Pardon?

00:51:55.153 --> 00:51:56.822
That's not the case.

00:51:57.572 --> 00:51:58.990
I heard you were a cop.

00:52:00.116 --> 00:52:03.245
You wrongfully lost your job
for investigating Cha Jeong-yeon.

00:52:04.955 --> 00:52:06.039
Yes.

00:52:06.122 --> 00:52:08.959
When he was a high schooler,
a freshman at that,

00:52:09.042 --> 00:52:11.253
he drove unlicensed
and under the influence

00:52:11.336 --> 00:52:14.130
and assaulted the policeman
who pulled him over.

00:52:14.798 --> 00:52:18.176
It was a simple investigation,
and I forgot about it after some time.

00:52:18.260 --> 00:52:21.721
But Assemblyman Cha held a grudge
against me and framed me.

00:52:21.805 --> 00:52:25.475
He bribed a suspect and framed me
for an assault by an official.

00:52:25.559 --> 00:52:26.685
Goodness.

00:52:26.768 --> 00:52:29.062
After that, Assemblyman Cha visited me

00:52:29.145 --> 00:52:32.482
to ask me to monitor his daughter
so she wouldn't end up like Jeong-yeon.

00:52:34.192 --> 00:52:35.527
That was

00:52:35.610 --> 00:52:39.197
when Ms. Cha had just enrolled
in middle school.

00:52:39.281 --> 00:52:40.782
Yes, it was since then.

00:52:42.284 --> 00:52:44.327
Since then, you've kept an eye on her.

00:52:46.496 --> 00:52:48.164
Since then, for a long time.

00:52:48.248 --> 00:52:49.583
Yes. I apologize.

00:52:50.292 --> 00:52:51.459
No, you're a perfect fit.

00:52:52.043 --> 00:52:53.044
Sorry.

00:52:54.045 --> 00:52:54.880
Sorry?

00:52:54.963 --> 00:52:58.049
We've lived together for 20 years,
but I don't know her.

00:52:58.133 --> 00:53:01.678
It's late,
but I want to know more about her.

00:53:01.761 --> 00:53:03.513
Because I realized

00:53:04.431 --> 00:53:07.434
that time and chances
aren't always available for you.

00:53:09.561 --> 00:53:10.937
I need to know the truth.

00:53:11.021 --> 00:53:12.397
The truth?

00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:13.523
What kind of--

00:53:13.607 --> 00:53:15.150
I want you to find out

00:53:15.901 --> 00:53:18.486
what deal she made with President Yu
five years ago.

00:53:18.570 --> 00:53:19.821
What?

00:53:19.905 --> 00:53:23.283
I'll pay you handsomely.
But you must investigate in secret.

00:53:23.366 --> 00:53:24.868
If you find any information,

00:53:24.951 --> 00:53:26.411
pass it to me, and only me.

00:53:26.494 --> 00:53:28.997
Okay, I understand.

00:53:29.080 --> 00:53:30.081
By the way,

00:53:30.790 --> 00:53:35.337
I prefer to get the payment in advance
for such investigations.

00:53:35.420 --> 00:53:39.132
And I only accept cash.

00:53:41.384 --> 00:53:42.802
I'll send the payment soon.

00:53:42.886 --> 00:53:43.970
I'll leave it to you.

00:53:48.308 --> 00:53:50.727
There's one more thing
I want you to look into.

00:53:50.810 --> 00:53:52.103
Pardon?

00:53:55.941 --> 00:53:57.233
As a buy one get one free.

00:53:58.234 --> 00:53:59.736
Sure, just let me know.

00:54:05.367 --> 00:54:09.579
Chairman Yang of Group H who was under
investigation for illegal succession was

00:54:09.663 --> 00:54:11.206
denied of an arrest warrant.

00:54:11.289 --> 00:54:14.292
Chairman Yang, who was detained
in Haseong Detention Center,

00:54:14.376 --> 00:54:16.044
was released.

00:54:25.053 --> 00:54:26.054
There he is.

00:54:31.685 --> 00:54:32.978
How do you feel?

00:54:33.061 --> 00:54:34.771
Any comments on the succession?

00:54:34.854 --> 00:54:37.482
-A word for the public?
-What about the investigation?

00:54:37.565 --> 00:54:39.109
-Just a word.
-Say something.

00:54:39.192 --> 00:54:40.610
How do you feel?

00:54:40.694 --> 00:54:41.695
Say something.

00:54:41.778 --> 00:54:43.655
Chairman Yang, say something.

00:54:43.738 --> 00:54:45.407
Thanks for your hard work.

00:54:45.490 --> 00:54:46.616
Anything else?

00:54:46.700 --> 00:54:48.326
-Stand back.
-Share your thought.

00:54:48.410 --> 00:54:50.370
-What do you have to say?
-Tell us.

00:54:50.453 --> 00:54:51.955
Chairman Yang, just a word.

00:54:52.038 --> 00:54:52.998
Anything else?

00:54:53.081 --> 00:54:54.207
Share your opinions.

00:54:54.290 --> 00:54:56.459
CLOSED TODAY

00:55:21.359 --> 00:55:22.736
I'll escort her.

00:55:26.740 --> 00:55:27.782
This way, please.

00:56:12.327 --> 00:56:13.161
Sis.

00:56:16.539 --> 00:56:18.333
You came to see the paintings.

00:56:18.416 --> 00:56:20.251
You're doing just fine.

00:56:20.335 --> 00:56:23.088
People would talk if they saw us together.

00:56:23.630 --> 00:56:25.381
It's quiet here at least.

00:56:25.465 --> 00:56:26.800
And…

00:56:28.051 --> 00:56:30.887
we aren't related by blood,
so don't call me sister.

00:56:30.970 --> 00:56:32.180
Come on.

00:56:32.263 --> 00:56:33.598
I'm just grateful.

00:56:34.140 --> 00:56:36.226
It's thanks to you that I was released.

00:56:43.858 --> 00:56:46.861
Then we should settle the bill.

00:56:48.321 --> 00:56:50.490
I heard Hwa-jin was here.

00:56:52.909 --> 00:56:53.910
I'm not sure.

00:56:55.620 --> 00:56:57.539
Why did you call Choi Myeong-ju then?

00:56:58.123 --> 00:57:01.960
"Lee Hwa-jin is here."
Didn't you need someone to tattle to me?

00:57:05.755 --> 00:57:06.881
I knew it.

00:57:07.423 --> 00:57:10.218
You and I think alike.

00:57:10.760 --> 00:57:12.512
Why are you keeping her?

00:57:13.263 --> 00:57:15.890
Because I heard you were
desperately looking for her.

00:57:17.183 --> 00:57:18.017
From whom?

00:57:19.644 --> 00:57:22.313
My brother-in-law
got Lee Hwa-jin discharged,

00:57:22.939 --> 00:57:25.191
and my sister was looking for her?

00:57:26.276 --> 00:57:27.527
Why?

00:57:27.610 --> 00:57:29.070
There must be a reason.

00:57:29.737 --> 00:57:31.448
Where did the patient in Room 501 go?

00:57:32.740 --> 00:57:35.368
I found that odd,

00:57:36.244 --> 00:57:39.456
and the doctor who saw
her blood test result reacted strangely.

00:57:41.499 --> 00:57:42.876
Is this accurate?

00:57:42.959 --> 00:57:45.503
So I checked the blood test result again.

00:57:46.212 --> 00:57:47.213
I found it strange too.

00:57:49.048 --> 00:57:50.925
Why? What was strange?

00:57:51.009 --> 00:57:52.677
Check the blood test result.

00:57:55.638 --> 00:57:56.848
Here.

00:57:59.184 --> 00:58:00.310
Lee Hwa-jin

00:58:00.393 --> 00:58:02.896
is likely pregnant.

00:58:09.861 --> 00:58:10.862
Pregnant?

00:58:10.945 --> 00:58:12.238
About Hwa-jin.

00:58:13.114 --> 00:58:15.533
At first glance, I thought,
"What the heck?"

00:58:16.326 --> 00:58:19.412
But after getting her cleaned
and dolled up,

00:58:20.955 --> 00:58:23.666
she was a sight to behold.

00:58:26.252 --> 00:58:27.795
My brother-in-law

00:58:28.379 --> 00:58:29.797
has an eye for women.

00:58:33.343 --> 00:58:34.385
Is the baby

00:58:35.011 --> 00:58:36.054
really his?

00:58:36.638 --> 00:58:38.515
You know I hate spoilers.

00:58:38.598 --> 00:58:40.016
Answer me.

00:58:42.185 --> 00:58:43.478
Well…

00:58:45.230 --> 00:58:46.773
Go and ask her yourself.

00:58:47.440 --> 00:58:48.816
She's waiting for you.

00:59:45.957 --> 00:59:47.041
Let go!

00:59:47.125 --> 00:59:49.210
I just grabbed her
to stop her from leaving,

00:59:49.294 --> 00:59:51.004
and she suddenly passed out.

00:59:51.087 --> 00:59:54.382
Cha Su-yeon stabbed me in the back.

00:59:54.465 --> 00:59:56.217
I'll handle it myself.

00:59:56.301 --> 00:59:58.720
I'll keep the party members' votes
under control

00:59:58.803 --> 00:59:59.971
and get the ledger.

01:00:00.054 --> 01:00:01.431
I'll do as you say.

01:00:02.140 --> 01:00:04.601
I'll do everything you say.

01:00:04.684 --> 01:00:05.893
Who is the father

01:00:05.977 --> 01:00:07.186
of the baby?

01:00:07.270 --> 01:00:09.480
Lee Hwa-jin will come forward herself.

01:00:09.564 --> 01:00:12.692
And say the baby is yours.
