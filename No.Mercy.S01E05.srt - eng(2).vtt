00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.144
(Lee Joo Young)

00:00:17.718 --> 00:00:21.855
(Ji Seung Hyun)

00:00:27.728 --> 00:00:31.932
(Koo Jun Hoe)

00:00:41.542 --> 00:00:43.810
(Mom)

00:00:45.779 --> 00:00:50.050
(No Mercy)

00:00:52.052 --> 00:00:53.053
(All characters, organizations, groups,)

00:00:53.053 --> 00:00:54.054
(and events in this drama are fictitious.)

00:00:54.054 --> 00:00:55.389
When are you coming?

00:00:59.593 --> 00:01:01.195
So Min, I'm sorry.

00:01:01.195 --> 00:01:03.730
Based on your dad's phone records,

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.032
we've confirmed that your mom's missing...

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:07.167
is linked with the Ilseong clan.

00:01:07.768 --> 00:01:09.703
I don't believe in
the law's idea of justice.

00:01:13.073 --> 00:01:14.041
The only way to the boss is...

00:01:14.041 --> 00:01:17.778
through Mr. Kim.

00:01:17.778 --> 00:01:19.880
You're saying we pretend to be her
to infiltrate the Ilseong clan?

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.048
Can that even work?

00:01:21.048 --> 00:01:23.350
They played us,

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.752
so we play them back,

00:01:26.286 --> 00:01:27.554
since we're already set on
getting revenge.

00:01:27.554 --> 00:01:28.755
Wei Chang Yu?

00:01:29.156 --> 00:01:30.424
You were under Park Gye Soon?

00:01:31.925 --> 00:01:34.261
What do you want from me?

00:01:34.428 --> 00:01:36.063
Get me in with your guys...

00:01:36.363 --> 00:01:37.731
and send me to China.

00:01:37.731 --> 00:01:38.799
Newbies.

00:01:39.066 --> 00:01:40.367
This is professional work.

00:01:40.367 --> 00:01:42.836
Each of you uses your expertise...

00:01:42.836 --> 00:01:44.905
to win clients' trust.

00:01:44.905 --> 00:01:46.807
She's already earned $36,000.

00:01:48.942 --> 00:01:50.010
He's calling for you.

00:01:50.244 --> 00:01:52.513
That's not how you treat a VIP.

00:01:52.513 --> 00:01:54.214
Nice to meet you, I'm Ma Seok Gu.

00:01:54.581 --> 00:01:55.749
What's your game?

00:01:56.016 --> 00:01:58.051
Tell me what you want from me.

00:01:58.051 --> 00:02:00.354
I want to hold a position here.

00:02:00.354 --> 00:02:02.089
Prove yourself with performance.

00:02:02.089 --> 00:02:04.391
So Min made it to China after all.

00:02:04.391 --> 00:02:06.293
Let's see what we can do.

00:02:09.763 --> 00:02:10.831
I'll pay the debt.

00:02:10.831 --> 00:02:12.366
I'll give you the money.

00:02:12.366 --> 00:02:13.567
Try it if you can.

00:02:14.368 --> 00:02:15.435
It's $500,000.

00:02:15.435 --> 00:02:16.770
This is the price of my mom's life.

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.906
Wei Chang Yu just made...

00:02:18.906 --> 00:02:20.774
a whopping $500,000 from just one client.

00:02:20.774 --> 00:02:22.776
To celebrate our new leader Wei Chang Yu,

00:02:22.776 --> 00:02:24.645
let's party hard today!

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.614
Here, drink up.

00:02:29.316 --> 00:02:30.584
Hello,

00:02:30.984 --> 00:02:32.619
I'm Manager Kim Mi Yang.

00:02:33.187 --> 00:02:35.556
Who is that?

00:02:35.556 --> 00:02:36.857
You know,

00:02:37.724 --> 00:02:39.259
some horribly unlucky lady.

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:41.461
I'll kill you.

00:02:43.063 --> 00:02:44.932
The day she joined the call center,

00:02:45.265 --> 00:02:47.401
the Korean handler was caught,

00:02:47.401 --> 00:02:49.770
and Mr. Kim disappeared too.

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.038
Dig deeper on Wei Chang Yu.

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:53.874
Use solid sources.

00:02:56.176 --> 00:02:59.112
(No Mercy)

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:22.402
I just learned
something really interesting.

00:03:23.604 --> 00:03:24.638
Guess what?

00:03:36.216 --> 00:03:37.451
This Wei Chang Yu,

00:03:38.018 --> 00:03:39.920
is this the same person as
this Wei Chang Yu here?

00:03:42.823 --> 00:03:44.925
This came out of our mascot's wallet.

00:03:45.526 --> 00:03:46.460
Do you two know each other?

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:50.697
(Kim Mi Yang)

00:03:54.034 --> 00:03:54.968
No, I don't.

00:03:55.602 --> 00:03:56.637
You don't know each other?

00:03:59.406 --> 00:04:00.374
Is an actor...

00:04:01.975 --> 00:04:04.111
supposed to know every random person...

00:04:04.711 --> 00:04:06.046
who comes to see a show?

00:04:15.022 --> 00:04:18.192
Out of everything I do,
gardening is the most tedious.

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:19.927
Why?

00:04:19.927 --> 00:04:21.828
Because once I trim these things back,

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:25.899
they just keep growing out of control.

00:04:28.769 --> 00:04:31.872
Trimming them down one by one
is a pain in the neck.

00:04:34.608 --> 00:04:35.676
But at the same time,

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:37.878
there's also a thrill to it,
so I can't stop.

00:04:46.053 --> 00:04:47.254
Hey, you idiot!

00:04:47.254 --> 00:04:49.256
I told you to think before you speak.

00:04:49.423 --> 00:04:50.324
Yes, sir.

00:04:50.324 --> 00:04:51.925
If you've got doubts, get proof first,
not later,

00:04:51.925 --> 00:04:53.894
Make that a habit, you idiot.

00:04:54.328 --> 00:04:56.730
Don't waste my time with ticket stubs...

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:59.800
during important conversations, you idiot!

00:05:02.035 --> 00:05:03.136
My apologies, sir.

00:05:04.004 --> 00:05:05.105
It was my mistake.

00:05:12.312 --> 00:05:13.780
Now, where were we?

00:05:18.318 --> 00:05:20.120
Do you know Mason Dedrick?

00:05:20.554 --> 00:05:21.655
(Episode 5)

00:05:21.655 --> 00:05:23.223
Mason is the guy...

00:05:23.223 --> 00:05:26.426
who made a name for himself
as a pit boss in Macau.

00:05:26.793 --> 00:05:28.662
- Now...
- He's with Black Kara.

00:05:30.831 --> 00:05:31.832
Not L.TM?

00:05:32.165 --> 00:05:34.201
I'll tell you straight.

00:05:35.002 --> 00:05:38.272
L.TM's already finished.

00:05:38.272 --> 00:05:40.541
What the hell are you talking about?
How is it finished?

00:05:40.541 --> 00:05:41.575
You didn't know?

00:05:41.975 --> 00:05:44.778
Everybody's heard that secret
that's been floating around.

00:05:46.213 --> 00:05:48.515
Black Kara snatched Mason up
for a huge sum...

00:05:48.515 --> 00:05:49.950
months ago now.

00:05:52.653 --> 00:05:55.989
There's no way I'd miss something
like that if there were signs.

00:05:58.392 --> 00:05:59.493
Of course.

00:06:00.294 --> 00:06:02.529
The Yankees stole the guy...

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:04.298
who was running the place,

00:06:05.098 --> 00:06:08.168
no one's stupid enough to show it.

00:06:09.036 --> 00:06:11.538
The way I see it,

00:06:13.207 --> 00:06:16.076
this could actually be a good opportunity.

00:06:18.145 --> 00:06:18.846
An opportunity?

00:06:19.646 --> 00:06:21.348
As you know well,

00:06:22.182 --> 00:06:23.884
the next big junket market is...

00:06:31.758 --> 00:06:33.060
going to be Singapore.

00:06:35.863 --> 00:06:37.831
How could you do that?

00:06:38.365 --> 00:06:41.368
I invested in Singapore
because of this one business.

00:06:41.668 --> 00:06:43.637
I knew the Macau market would go south,

00:06:43.637 --> 00:06:45.772
so I'd already been building a base
in Singapore.

00:06:47.574 --> 00:06:50.277
Do you know which Korean company
actually owns...

00:06:51.445 --> 00:06:52.412
a casino in Singapore?

00:06:53.413 --> 00:06:55.516
Genie Tourism Development.

00:06:55.516 --> 00:06:56.817
They operate Genie the Star Resort.

00:06:58.051 --> 00:07:01.889
They've been desperate to recruit Mason.

00:07:01.889 --> 00:07:02.789
So...

00:07:02.789 --> 00:07:06.059
You're saying we should recruit Mason
for Genie, right?

00:07:06.727 --> 00:07:08.762
Don't be ridiculous.

00:07:10.197 --> 00:07:12.900
How could we possibly reel in
a giant like him?

00:07:13.467 --> 00:07:15.068
I may not know Mason personally,

00:07:15.936 --> 00:07:18.739
but I know his right-hand man well.

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:22.142
That guy is the one...

00:07:24.111 --> 00:07:26.580
who's got Mason wrapped around
his little finger.

00:07:41.261 --> 00:07:42.462
His name is Eric Choi.

00:07:44.631 --> 00:07:45.699
Eric Choi.

00:07:57.544 --> 00:07:58.779
(CIISC1225)

00:08:00.214 --> 00:08:01.448
Hey, Wei Chang Yu.

00:08:02.916 --> 00:08:03.984
How's it going?

00:08:03.984 --> 00:08:06.486
I almost didn't recognize you.

00:08:06.486 --> 00:08:08.689
I thought you'd dropped off the map.

00:08:08.689 --> 00:08:10.023
How've you been?

00:08:10.023 --> 00:08:11.258
Your boss treating you well?

00:08:11.258 --> 00:08:12.392
Of course.

00:08:12.392 --> 00:08:15.162
Thanks to me, he's been in
back-to-back meetings.

00:08:15.529 --> 00:08:16.396
Is that right?

00:08:17.064 --> 00:08:18.432
I heard you've been busy...

00:08:18.432 --> 00:08:20.534
managing restaurants for Black Kara.

00:08:21.635 --> 00:08:25.105
Yeah, I'm busting my ass
trying to raise his value.

00:08:25.105 --> 00:08:27.841
Black Kara doesn't measure up,
not even close.

00:08:27.841 --> 00:08:30.244
Some places are offering extra money
just to get him on board.

00:08:30.444 --> 00:08:32.579
Sounds like big money.
Who's making the offer?

00:08:32.579 --> 00:08:35.616
Chang Yu, I can't tell you that.

00:08:35.616 --> 00:08:36.717
It's business.

00:08:37.618 --> 00:08:40.220
Anyway, what are you up to?

00:08:40.687 --> 00:08:41.989
I'm in China right now.

00:08:42.422 --> 00:08:44.992
Have you ever heard of
the Yanbian businessman, Mr. Ma?

00:08:45.359 --> 00:08:46.660
Wait.

00:08:47.027 --> 00:08:48.662
Isn't that the guy
who got kicked out of L.TM?

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:52.366
I heard he's just sucking up to
Chairman Kim...

00:08:52.366 --> 00:08:54.835
and making a living
with his fucking voice phishing schemes.

00:08:54.835 --> 00:08:57.337
And people call him a businessman?

00:09:00.107 --> 00:09:01.475
I'm Mr. MA.

00:09:02.609 --> 00:09:03.944
Please, go on.

00:09:05.112 --> 00:09:06.079
My goodness.

00:09:06.413 --> 00:09:08.148
Please forgive me...

00:09:08.148 --> 00:09:10.617
for saying something offensive.
I ask for your understanding.

00:09:11.018 --> 00:09:14.288
Honestly, you work for Chairman Kim,

00:09:14.288 --> 00:09:17.624
and I work for Mason. We're both
just employees doing what we're told.

00:09:17.624 --> 00:09:19.860
We're in this together.

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:23.764
Your apology sounds insincere.

00:09:23.764 --> 00:09:25.032
Of course not.

00:09:25.199 --> 00:09:27.968
I'm about to get thrown out myself,
just like you.

00:09:29.403 --> 00:09:30.838
About Mason,

00:09:31.138 --> 00:09:34.408
you know Marine Bay Casino in Singapore?

00:09:34.408 --> 00:09:37.711
They're replacing the entire management.

00:09:37.711 --> 00:09:42.282
Wait, they're replacing
Marine Bay's entire management team?

00:09:43.684 --> 00:09:46.053
That son of a bitch Mason...

00:09:46.053 --> 00:09:48.755
wants to kick me out
and put his wife in my director position.

00:09:49.323 --> 00:09:51.458
This is why you can't trust anyone
in this business.

00:09:51.458 --> 00:09:52.359
Damn it.

00:09:52.359 --> 00:09:54.828
I can see why you'd be upset.

00:09:55.062 --> 00:09:57.130
Think about it, Mr. Ma.

00:09:57.431 --> 00:09:59.600
After all those years of loyalty,

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:02.002
we're always the first ones...

00:10:02.002 --> 00:10:03.103
thrown away.

00:10:03.337 --> 00:10:05.839
If we're disposable tails to be cut off,
we might as well bite back.

00:10:05.839 --> 00:10:06.974
Don't you agree?

00:10:06.974 --> 00:10:09.343
You'd betray your boss?

00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:11.645
No, I wouldn't call it betrayal.

00:10:11.645 --> 00:10:14.114
It's more like a business transaction.

00:10:16.216 --> 00:10:17.918
So if someone wants Mason,

00:10:18.652 --> 00:10:20.053
you'd hand him over?

00:10:21.355 --> 00:10:23.123
A deal isn't complicated.

00:10:23.357 --> 00:10:25.325
It's just give-and-take.

00:10:25.325 --> 00:10:27.995
If both sides' needs match,
that's all it takes.

00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:32.332
I feel like we'll get along pretty well.

00:10:33.333 --> 00:10:35.969
I'd like to meet and talk in person.

00:10:38.372 --> 00:10:39.239
As for me,

00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:42.876
I really like people I vibe with.

00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:44.912
There's no reason to say no.

00:10:45.345 --> 00:10:46.847
All right.

00:10:46.847 --> 00:10:49.082
I'll share the location in Korea...

00:10:49.082 --> 00:10:51.218
Since I'm doing business in China,

00:10:51.552 --> 00:10:53.153
it's tough for me to leave.

00:10:54.087 --> 00:10:55.255
As you know,

00:10:55.556 --> 00:10:58.625
I make a living
with my fucking voice phishing schemes.

00:10:59.226 --> 00:11:01.228
I'll give you a proper welcome
if you come.

00:11:11.638 --> 00:11:14.341
You'll need to cover the ticket.

00:11:16.743 --> 00:11:19.446
That's just the basic manners as a host.

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:23.584
We'll set up the time and date for you.

00:11:32.226 --> 00:11:35.028
I knew he wouldn't fall for it easily.

00:11:35.996 --> 00:11:38.899
We need to lure Ma Seok Gu
to Korea quickly...

00:11:38.899 --> 00:11:40.667
so we can do anything.

00:11:42.202 --> 00:11:43.837
Do you have to go?

00:11:45.272 --> 00:11:46.139
I have to.

00:11:48.308 --> 00:11:50.811
Yes, Chairman, I took the call for Mr. Ma.

00:11:50.811 --> 00:11:52.980
What took you so long to answer the phone?
Where's Seok Gu?

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:53.881
Get him on the phone now.

00:11:54.515 --> 00:11:55.449
I'm sorry, sir.

00:11:55.749 --> 00:11:57.484
Mr. Ma's in a meeting now.

00:11:57.718 --> 00:12:00.387
Why haven't I heard anything
about the business ledger?

00:12:00.587 --> 00:12:02.523
I'm sure he's still reviewing it.

00:12:02.789 --> 00:12:04.291
I'm scheduled to sign the contract...

00:12:04.291 --> 00:12:07.060
with L.TM Agency tomorrow at 3 p.m.

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:09.363
How come it hasn't been sent yet?

00:12:09.363 --> 00:12:10.464
I'm sorry.

00:12:10.831 --> 00:12:12.132
We'll send it right away, sir.

00:12:13.166 --> 00:12:14.134
What meeting...

00:12:15.502 --> 00:12:17.004
is he in right now?

00:12:19.673 --> 00:12:21.308
He's in a script development meeting.

00:12:25.379 --> 00:12:27.314
A script development meeting...

00:12:28.115 --> 00:12:30.984
You really expect me to believe that?

00:12:31.485 --> 00:12:34.721
I'm losing my mind over here,
and he's just chilling in a meeting?

00:12:34.721 --> 00:12:35.923
That is bullshit.

00:12:39.126 --> 00:12:40.727
Well...

00:12:41.662 --> 00:12:42.629
Is Seok Gu...

00:12:44.164 --> 00:12:45.933
going behind my back...

00:12:46.567 --> 00:12:47.334
because of this incident?

00:12:47.768 --> 00:12:49.036
Absolutely not, sir.

00:12:49.736 --> 00:12:51.905
It's just for a new business venture.

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:53.674
Is that so?

00:12:55.576 --> 00:12:56.944
He's starting a new project...

00:12:56.944 --> 00:12:59.580
without my approval, huh?

00:13:00.347 --> 00:13:01.582
That's not it.

00:13:01.582 --> 00:13:02.916
Tell him...

00:13:02.916 --> 00:13:05.219
to also hand over
the slush fund account too.

00:13:06.486 --> 00:13:09.389
I can't trust my money with someone
who's got other plans.

00:13:09.756 --> 00:13:11.725
That's all I have to say.

00:13:11.725 --> 00:13:13.727
Make sure he gets the message
loud and clear.

00:13:15.529 --> 00:13:17.097
Chairman!

00:13:23.837 --> 00:13:26.073
Looks like your staff is giving you
a headache.

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:30.544
This is why people need power.

00:13:30.544 --> 00:13:31.578
Take me, for example.

00:13:31.578 --> 00:13:33.780
I'm just a businessman,

00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:36.049
so my people keep causing me problems.

00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:40.187
My son is nothing but trouble,

00:13:40.187 --> 00:13:41.955
so who am I to judge?

00:13:43.624 --> 00:13:45.993
One day, he'll come around.

00:13:46.426 --> 00:13:47.427
Do you think so?

00:13:49.963 --> 00:13:50.898
In any case,

00:13:51.298 --> 00:13:54.168
my son won't give you any more trouble...

00:13:54.668 --> 00:13:56.103
over this matter.

00:14:08.749 --> 00:14:11.051
Chang Yu, you still look stunning.

00:14:12.653 --> 00:14:14.021
You haven't aged a day.

00:14:14.922 --> 00:14:16.356
Seems like I'm the only one aging.

00:14:17.724 --> 00:14:20.460
How should I address you?

00:14:21.361 --> 00:14:22.996
Where are my manners?

00:14:24.831 --> 00:14:27.501
Just call me Eric.

00:14:27.935 --> 00:14:29.269
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

00:14:29.703 --> 00:14:30.604
All right.

00:14:31.405 --> 00:14:33.640
Wow, a surveillance manager.

00:14:33.841 --> 00:14:36.543
I didn't realize you were running
the whole operation.

00:14:37.144 --> 00:14:39.012
You're quite mysterious.

00:14:40.447 --> 00:14:42.015
Why would I show myself?

00:14:42.015 --> 00:14:44.484
That would just draw unwanted attention.

00:14:46.753 --> 00:14:47.721
I see.

00:14:49.189 --> 00:14:52.492
I've crossed paths with Mason at L.TM.

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:55.762
I've met most of his people.

00:14:56.697 --> 00:14:59.633
But since we've never met,
I wanted to learn more about you.

00:15:02.236 --> 00:15:04.671
I thought we'd be discussing business,

00:15:04.671 --> 00:15:06.173
so I rushed over,

00:15:06.173 --> 00:15:08.675
but it seems you just wanted to
check me out.

00:15:10.344 --> 00:15:11.845
As potential partners,

00:15:11.845 --> 00:15:14.147
we need to get to know each other.

00:15:15.349 --> 00:15:17.217
Mason's not your average guy.

00:15:17.484 --> 00:15:19.920
He's a major player
in the casino business.

00:15:20.087 --> 00:15:22.890
And an Asian pulling the strings
on a guy like that,

00:15:23.423 --> 00:15:25.959
that's pretty impressive.

00:15:25.959 --> 00:15:28.061
I'm more than just a pretty face.

00:15:28.729 --> 00:15:30.397
I'm full of surprises.

00:15:33.734 --> 00:15:35.602
And you showed up like this,

00:15:36.403 --> 00:15:37.604
like you'd been waiting for this.

00:15:39.139 --> 00:15:41.241
This is quite a start.

00:15:42.309 --> 00:15:45.412
It's great to see you two...

00:15:45.412 --> 00:15:46.580
hitting it off already.

00:15:46.813 --> 00:15:47.648
You think so?

00:15:50.117 --> 00:15:53.587
To make good partners, we need chemistry.

00:15:54.254 --> 00:15:55.589
Let's make it work then.

00:15:55.789 --> 00:15:56.690
Shall we?

00:15:56.690 --> 00:15:59.626
If not, we'll figure it out.

00:16:02.095 --> 00:16:02.930
Fair enough.

00:16:25.686 --> 00:16:28.088
It's not much, but this is my business.

00:16:29.690 --> 00:16:31.859
It actually looks pretty impressive to me.

00:16:33.493 --> 00:16:34.328
Let's go inside.

00:16:44.304 --> 00:16:45.138
(Chairman)

00:16:45.138 --> 00:16:46.139
What the hell?

00:16:46.139 --> 00:16:48.442
Is he some kind of loan shark or what?

00:16:48.442 --> 00:16:50.511
He's causing a scene in broad daylight.

00:16:50.811 --> 00:16:51.845
Here, you hold onto this.

00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:54.781
Any update on what I asked?

00:16:54.781 --> 00:16:56.416
Word from Samhaphoe is that...

00:16:56.416 --> 00:16:58.585
Eric Choi's pulling Mason's strings.

00:16:59.553 --> 00:17:02.523
pparently he was in a Filipino gang in LA.

00:17:02.756 --> 00:17:04.424
Are we sure he's the same guy?

00:17:04.791 --> 00:17:08.095
They weren't completely sure
from the screenshots,

00:17:08.095 --> 00:17:10.030
but they think it's him.

00:17:16.136 --> 00:17:17.304
Hey, stop.

00:17:19.039 --> 00:17:21.008
My apologies for that.

00:17:21.909 --> 00:17:23.977
My guys tend to be cautious.

00:17:24.845 --> 00:17:26.046
It's fine.

00:17:26.046 --> 00:17:27.514
It's like at airports,

00:17:27.514 --> 00:17:29.449
you have to go through security.

00:17:30.751 --> 00:17:31.451
Let's head in.

00:17:40.894 --> 00:17:41.762
Have a seat.

00:17:52.739 --> 00:17:54.708
I was planning to ask you
for a tour later,

00:17:54.708 --> 00:17:55.676
but with these monitors,

00:17:55.676 --> 00:17:59.246
you can see everything from here,
so we can skip the tour.

00:18:00.681 --> 00:18:03.617
I like to have everything
under control...

00:18:03.617 --> 00:18:04.818
for peace of mind.

00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:09.790
I'll go get us some drinks.

00:18:10.724 --> 00:18:11.892
I'll give you two some privacy.

00:18:12.226 --> 00:18:13.093
Okay.

00:18:20.601 --> 00:18:21.568
Where are you going?

00:18:24.805 --> 00:18:27.441
When you have a guest, you should...

00:18:27.441 --> 00:18:28.509
get drinks for them, right?

00:18:28.876 --> 00:18:29.710
Well then.

00:18:30.511 --> 00:18:32.379
I'll have my guys bring them.

00:18:33.146 --> 00:18:34.114
You can stay inside.

00:18:34.381 --> 00:18:35.349
No worries.

00:18:35.983 --> 00:18:37.384
I need to use the restroom anyway.

00:18:44.057 --> 00:18:45.726
(CCTV CONTROL BOX)

00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:51.198
What's going on?

00:18:52.666 --> 00:18:54.635
Yoo Seung, the cameras are out.

00:18:55.169 --> 00:18:56.737
Tell the guys to fix them now.

00:19:02.042 --> 00:19:04.378
How do you know Mason?

00:19:04.778 --> 00:19:05.946
Actually,

00:19:05.946 --> 00:19:09.416
I had some Filipino friends in LA.

00:19:09.416 --> 00:19:12.152
To be honest, my life was
a complete mess back then.

00:19:12.152 --> 00:19:15.455
Then one day, this guy approached me...

00:19:15.455 --> 00:19:18.225
and asked me if I wanted to work together.

00:19:19.393 --> 00:19:20.727
That guy was Mason.

00:19:23.463 --> 00:19:27.267
Sounds like Mason knows
how to pick his people.

00:19:29.603 --> 00:19:31.905
I'm more of a thinker,

00:19:31.905 --> 00:19:33.807
so I'm not much of a sports guy.

00:19:33.807 --> 00:19:35.175
I can't throw a curveball.

00:19:36.009 --> 00:19:37.811
Let me ask you something directly.

00:19:38.045 --> 00:19:39.112
Sure.

00:19:39.112 --> 00:19:41.949
Can you put me in touch with Mason?

00:19:43.684 --> 00:19:45.986
You haven't heard my answer yet.

00:19:45.986 --> 00:19:47.321
Aren't you getting ahead of yourself?

00:19:53.694 --> 00:19:56.296
You really blindsided me there.

00:19:57.297 --> 00:19:59.600
Okay, let me put it differently.

00:20:00.734 --> 00:20:02.269
You've heard of
Genie Tourism Development, right?

00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:06.573
They just built the largest resort
in Singapore.

00:20:07.374 --> 00:20:10.277
They want to scout Mason.

00:20:12.446 --> 00:20:13.447
Are you saying...

00:20:14.915 --> 00:20:17.184
you want to hand Mason over to Genie?

00:20:19.186 --> 00:20:21.855
All the money from that deal is yours.

00:20:22.422 --> 00:20:25.192
I only want the business contract.

00:20:25.859 --> 00:20:28.462
What do you say we partner up?

00:20:29.863 --> 00:20:32.566
That's not difficult to arrange.

00:20:32.566 --> 00:20:34.868
If we're going to be in the same boat,

00:20:36.136 --> 00:20:38.205
investing in my venture...

00:20:38.205 --> 00:20:40.641
might be a better option.

00:20:42.209 --> 00:20:42.976
An investment?

00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:54.821
(DEB GAME investment)

00:21:01.228 --> 00:21:02.963
(Profit comparison shows
over 200% difference)

00:21:02.963 --> 00:21:03.764
Hold on.

00:21:04.898 --> 00:21:06.533
This is an online casino game, isn't it?

00:21:07.701 --> 00:21:09.536
You want me to invest in this?

00:21:12.139 --> 00:21:15.042
I guarantee you'll make money.

00:21:15.275 --> 00:21:17.678
Unfortunately, it seems we want
different things, so let's end this here,

00:21:17.678 --> 00:21:18.712
while I'm still being polite.

00:21:31.225 --> 00:21:33.227
Take a look and think it over.

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:35.128
You won't regret it.

00:21:42.769 --> 00:21:45.305
Do you recognize this person?

00:21:47.407 --> 00:21:50.377
(Congressman Seo Jung Geun proposes
a self-regulation bill for P2E games)

00:21:50.377 --> 00:21:52.713
Can't you speed it up?

00:22:33.387 --> 00:22:34.321
You wanted to see me?

00:22:34.821 --> 00:22:37.824
They're fixing the security cameras.

00:22:37.824 --> 00:22:40.227
Make sure everyone stays
extra alert in the meantime.

00:22:40.227 --> 00:22:41.195
Yes, sir.

00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:21.635
Congressman Seo Jung Geun?

00:23:21.635 --> 00:23:23.203
He's the one who signed off on...

00:23:23.203 --> 00:23:25.873
Genie Tourism Development's
resort project.

00:23:27.241 --> 00:23:29.243
He's also helped my business.

00:23:29.776 --> 00:23:31.578
So what you're saying is...

00:23:31.578 --> 00:23:32.980
Like you said,

00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:35.983
if you can't throw a curveball,
throw it straight.

00:23:35.983 --> 00:23:36.850
Think about it.

00:23:37.317 --> 00:23:38.852
Even if we deliver Mason to Genie,

00:23:38.852 --> 00:23:41.722
there's no guarantee
we'll get the contract.

00:23:41.722 --> 00:23:42.623
But,

00:23:42.623 --> 00:23:44.858
what if we go straight to the person
who controls it?

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:50.464
Are you saying you'll introduce me
to Seo Jung Geun?

00:23:50.464 --> 00:23:53.767
As long as you agree to my proposal,

00:23:54.801 --> 00:23:55.836
I can make that happen.

00:23:57.704 --> 00:23:59.373
(DEB GAME Investment)

00:24:00.073 --> 00:24:03.277
Documents like this are easy to fake.

00:24:05.078 --> 00:24:07.714
How can you prove you really know...

00:24:07.714 --> 00:24:09.082
Seo Jung Geun?

00:24:09.082 --> 00:24:10.050
You want proof?

00:24:11.485 --> 00:24:14.254
That's easy to prove.

00:24:14.788 --> 00:24:16.957
The truth speaks for itself.

00:24:18.992 --> 00:24:20.227
Give me a second.

00:24:25.399 --> 00:24:27.367
Yes, sir. It's Eric.

00:24:27.901 --> 00:24:29.937
Eric, where are you?

00:24:29.937 --> 00:24:31.939
I see you're calling internationally.

00:24:32.239 --> 00:24:36.210
I'm in China meeting a potential partner.

00:24:37.244 --> 00:24:38.345
I see.

00:24:38.345 --> 00:24:40.080
Anyway, about the public hearing.

00:24:40.747 --> 00:24:41.882
The schedule's set.

00:24:42.583 --> 00:24:43.951
It worked out the way you wanted.

00:24:44.184 --> 00:24:45.219
Is that true?

00:24:46.286 --> 00:24:48.522
People in this country are naive.

00:24:49.189 --> 00:24:52.759
They don't care
about complex issues like P2E.

00:24:56.930 --> 00:24:58.866
When you throw around fancy words...

00:24:58.866 --> 00:25:00.634
like freedom,

00:25:00.634 --> 00:25:02.603
they think that's democracy.

00:25:03.704 --> 00:25:05.739
- Those kinds of abstract ideas...
- Whoa, they fixed it really fast.

00:25:05.739 --> 00:25:08.775
can mean whatever you want them to mean.

00:25:09.610 --> 00:25:12.012
They don't realize
they're being manipulated by politicians.

00:25:12.012 --> 00:25:14.147
They're too busy fighting with each other.

00:25:20.854 --> 00:25:21.788
Oh my gosh.

00:25:25.492 --> 00:25:26.593
It's done.

00:25:26.593 --> 00:25:28.562
You, watch things here.

00:25:29.263 --> 00:25:31.865
You, go through the cameras in each room.

00:25:31.865 --> 00:25:32.766
Yes, sir.

00:25:35.068 --> 00:25:36.170
Anyway,

00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:39.540
you won't make it to the meeting
with Chairman Ahn then.

00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:40.507
Chairman Ahn?

00:25:41.141 --> 00:25:43.510
Enjoy it for me.

00:25:43.510 --> 00:25:46.346
Genie went global thanks to you.

00:25:46.346 --> 00:25:49.383
You deserve all the credit.

00:25:51.451 --> 00:25:54.388
Don't flatter me like that,
you're embarrassing me.

00:25:54.388 --> 00:25:56.356
We've been talking too long.

00:25:56.356 --> 00:25:59.459
I'm afraid I've kept you too long.

00:25:59.459 --> 00:26:01.828
I'll visit when I get back to Korea.

00:26:01.828 --> 00:26:04.798
The chairman is demanding
the secret account.

00:26:05.699 --> 00:26:08.001
Damn, he's serious?

00:26:09.837 --> 00:26:10.771
Hold on.

00:26:12.139 --> 00:26:13.473
Hello, Congressman.

00:26:13.941 --> 00:26:16.543
I'm Ma Seok Gu,
I'm setting up a business in Singapore.

00:26:19.479 --> 00:26:20.480
Hi.

00:26:22.182 --> 00:26:23.217
Pleased to meet you.

00:26:23.951 --> 00:26:25.986
Is this really Congressman Seo Jung Geun?

00:26:27.454 --> 00:26:28.322
Well...

00:26:29.890 --> 00:26:31.091
I'm not sure what you mean.

00:26:32.326 --> 00:26:33.393
My apologies.

00:26:33.694 --> 00:26:34.761
It's just...

00:26:35.429 --> 00:26:38.498
I'm thinking about investing
in Eric's business,

00:26:38.498 --> 00:26:39.633
based on your connection.

00:26:40.534 --> 00:26:42.870
You're investing in someone
you've never met just because of me?

00:26:44.338 --> 00:26:46.139
Isn't that rather hasty?

00:26:59.486 --> 00:27:01.421
I'll trust you,

00:27:01.955 --> 00:27:04.291
I'll invest $5 million.

00:27:04.625 --> 00:27:06.493
But I need a favor.

00:27:06.493 --> 00:27:08.428
I need the junket operating license.

00:27:08.428 --> 00:27:11.298
Could you put me in touch with
Genie Tourism?

00:27:12.599 --> 00:27:13.700
For now,

00:27:13.967 --> 00:27:15.035
sure.

00:27:15.602 --> 00:27:19.039
I'm having lunch with Chairman Ahn
tomorrow, I'll update you later.

00:27:19.473 --> 00:27:22.109
He'll be very interested.

00:27:23.410 --> 00:27:26.413
He's been looking to expand
his casino operations.

00:27:27.381 --> 00:27:28.482
Is that so?

00:27:29.183 --> 00:27:31.919
Thank you, Congressman.
I won't forget this.

00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:36.023
If money's coming in, why would he refuse?

00:27:39.927 --> 00:27:42.095
Looking forward to working together.

00:27:55.676 --> 00:27:57.244
I need to send...

00:27:57.244 --> 00:27:59.413
your email address to him.

00:27:59.413 --> 00:28:01.548
Can I use the email
from your business card?

00:28:02.082 --> 00:28:03.016
Of course.

00:28:03.016 --> 00:28:04.084
Great.

00:28:04.084 --> 00:28:06.987
Can you transfer the funds?

00:28:06.987 --> 00:28:08.255
What form of payment?

00:28:08.655 --> 00:28:11.925
It's in cryptocurrency.

00:28:11.925 --> 00:28:13.260
That works, right?

00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:14.828
Absolutely.

00:28:14.828 --> 00:28:16.096
That's even better.

00:28:19.299 --> 00:28:21.869
What are you doing here?

00:28:22.903 --> 00:28:24.605
Well...

00:28:24.605 --> 00:28:26.006
I asked what you're doing.

00:28:27.307 --> 00:28:28.876
I need to check something.

00:28:28.876 --> 00:28:30.043
Let me see it.

00:28:30.210 --> 00:28:31.044
Hand it over.

00:28:32.613 --> 00:28:33.447
Give it to me.

00:28:34.982 --> 00:28:38.886
I didn't think we'd get along at first.

00:28:38.886 --> 00:28:42.189
But now I think we're perfect partners.

00:28:42.556 --> 00:28:43.690
I guess so.

00:28:44.491 --> 00:28:47.194
Maybe we knew each other in a past life.

00:28:49.663 --> 00:28:50.664
By the way,

00:28:51.031 --> 00:28:55.035
where do Chairman Ahn and Congressman Seo
usually meet for lunch?

00:28:55.802 --> 00:28:56.970
Usually...

00:28:56.970 --> 00:28:58.972
Sir!

00:29:00.107 --> 00:29:02.843
Let go, I said let go.

00:29:02.843 --> 00:29:04.011
Seriously.

00:29:04.011 --> 00:29:06.180
Sir!

00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:08.015
Sorry about the disturbance.

00:29:08.015 --> 00:29:09.349
Seems like something urgent came up.

00:29:10.951 --> 00:29:12.486
What's his problem?

00:29:13.954 --> 00:29:14.855
Let go.

00:29:17.491 --> 00:29:18.392
What's this about?

00:29:18.825 --> 00:29:20.894
She's acting suspicious.

00:29:21.495 --> 00:29:23.197
I caught her doing something.

00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:26.233
I told her to give it to me,
but she won't.

00:29:31.538 --> 00:29:32.673
Let go!

00:29:46.353 --> 00:29:47.387
Let go already!

00:29:50.424 --> 00:29:53.260
I didn't do anything wrong!

00:29:53.894 --> 00:29:54.761
What is it?

00:30:12.913 --> 00:30:13.747
Wait, first...

00:30:14.982 --> 00:30:16.550
let's check it first.

00:30:17.718 --> 00:30:18.919
Check what?

00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:21.121
Where's the congressman?

00:30:23.056 --> 00:30:26.093
He's probably busy
with the election campaign.

00:30:27.561 --> 00:30:31.365
Then he'll definitely make lunch tomorrow.

00:30:32.299 --> 00:30:36.069
He'll review my contract too.

00:30:36.403 --> 00:30:37.437
Sure.

00:30:37.437 --> 00:30:39.640
That's what he said on the phone.

00:30:41.875 --> 00:30:44.311
But why would such a busy man...

00:30:44.311 --> 00:30:46.079
at the prosecutor's office?

00:30:49.116 --> 00:30:51.585
What do you mean?

00:30:57.958 --> 00:31:01.428
Apparently, this was big news today.

00:31:03.697 --> 00:31:05.566
How could someone caught up in this...

00:31:05.566 --> 00:31:07.634
had the time to chat with me?

00:31:08.602 --> 00:31:11.104
Are you accusing me of faking it?

00:31:11.104 --> 00:31:12.806
With someone that important?

00:31:12.973 --> 00:31:13.841
Well...

00:31:14.508 --> 00:31:16.476
Technology's advanced enough these days,

00:31:17.077 --> 00:31:19.179
anything's possible.

00:31:26.787 --> 00:31:28.322
You knew all about it, didn't you?

00:31:28.989 --> 00:31:32.426
This is Kim Doo Sik's doing, isn't it?

00:31:32.426 --> 00:31:34.995
He's trying to take my stuff again!

00:31:35.195 --> 00:31:36.096
No.

00:31:36.096 --> 00:31:37.030
Damn it.

00:31:38.899 --> 00:31:40.000
That's enough.

00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:41.201
That's enough?

00:31:41.201 --> 00:31:42.369
That's enough?

00:31:42.970 --> 00:31:44.805
Then prove it.

00:31:45.506 --> 00:31:47.875
Bring Congressman Seo here.

00:31:47.875 --> 00:31:49.409
Then I'll believe it.

00:31:54.815 --> 00:31:56.149
What? You can't?

00:32:02.022 --> 00:32:03.690
The person you are calling is unavailable.

00:32:03.690 --> 00:32:06.393
Your call has been forwarded to voicemail.

00:32:07.494 --> 00:32:08.862
Get him here. Now.

00:32:09.429 --> 00:32:12.666
When you hear the beep,
press the star or pound key.

00:32:12.666 --> 00:32:13.934
You have five hours.

00:32:15.035 --> 00:32:18.705
Congressman Seo, we have a situation.
I need you here.

00:32:19.673 --> 00:32:21.475
I'll explain everything when we meet.

00:32:22.109 --> 00:32:24.511
You can spare some time.

00:32:25.279 --> 00:32:26.313
It's urgent.

00:32:26.313 --> 00:32:28.949
Meet me at Seungam-sa Temple
at 8 p.m. today.

00:32:34.354 --> 00:32:35.722
You have five hours, Eric.

00:32:36.957 --> 00:32:38.959
That's your window
to get home in one piece.

00:32:44.198 --> 00:32:45.933
- Hey, get in here.
- Yes, sir.

00:32:45.933 --> 00:32:47.234
Get them on the boat.

00:32:47.234 --> 00:32:49.102
- We're heading to Korea.
- Yes, sir.

00:33:06.887 --> 00:33:08.155
Damn it!

00:33:35.916 --> 00:33:37.618
You're running out of time.

00:33:38.519 --> 00:33:40.888
I gave you an extra hour and five minutes.

00:33:41.121 --> 00:33:43.090
Why are you testing my patience?

00:33:43.690 --> 00:33:44.525
Huh?

00:33:49.296 --> 00:33:51.198
Eric!

00:33:52.799 --> 00:33:54.268
What's all this about?

00:33:56.637 --> 00:33:57.538
Hello, sir.

00:33:58.839 --> 00:34:01.441
Eric, what in the world is this?

00:34:02.276 --> 00:34:03.210
Well...

00:34:10.884 --> 00:34:13.487
We need to get Ma Seok Gu to Korea
at all costs.

00:34:13.854 --> 00:34:17.124
If it were that easy,
he'd be in jail already.

00:34:19.159 --> 00:34:20.394
You didn't know that, did you?

00:34:22.796 --> 00:34:24.131
Back when I was at the police academy,

00:34:25.032 --> 00:34:26.300
I was a reporter.

00:34:28.235 --> 00:34:29.636
That's my ace in the hole.

00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:35.642
You want me to play a corrupt politician?

00:34:35.642 --> 00:34:36.944
That day,

00:34:36.944 --> 00:34:40.080
I'll make you look like
a corrupt investor.

00:34:40.347 --> 00:34:41.582
You mean...

00:34:41.949 --> 00:34:44.551
the tax office will actually
raid my house?

00:34:45.986 --> 00:34:47.855
My wife will have a heart attack.

00:34:47.855 --> 00:34:50.557
Have I ever let you down, sir?

00:34:51.191 --> 00:34:52.826
Not once.

00:34:53.393 --> 00:34:56.263
You've only ever helped me.

00:35:00.634 --> 00:35:02.970
Every time I remember losing $1 million...

00:35:02.970 --> 00:35:06.073
to those bastards,

00:35:06.073 --> 00:35:08.108
it makes my blood boil.

00:35:08.809 --> 00:35:12.045
I'll take those bastards down for good.

00:35:13.947 --> 00:35:14.848
You're with me, right?

00:35:17.551 --> 00:35:20.254
I'll do whatever you need.

00:35:20.954 --> 00:35:22.122
Don't screw this up.

00:35:22.422 --> 00:35:23.257
Yes, sir.

00:35:23.991 --> 00:35:27.394
This stays between us.

00:35:27.394 --> 00:35:28.328
As you know,

00:35:30.264 --> 00:35:34.001
to pull off something big,
what you have to guard most is your mouth.

00:35:42.676 --> 00:35:43.710
Are you Mr. Ma?

00:35:44.611 --> 00:35:45.546
Yes, sir.

00:35:45.546 --> 00:35:49.116
Tell me what's going on, Mr. Ma.

00:35:49.383 --> 00:35:50.450
Well...

00:35:51.485 --> 00:35:53.520
Sir, actually...

00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:54.321
Excuse me.

00:35:56.790 --> 00:35:58.559
There's been a misunderstanding.

00:35:58.959 --> 00:35:59.860
A misunderstanding?

00:36:00.694 --> 00:36:01.461
What do you mean?

00:36:05.265 --> 00:36:06.133
Well...

00:36:07.835 --> 00:36:08.969
I'm really sorry.

00:36:09.903 --> 00:36:12.339
Greed got the better of me.
Eric and I plotted...

00:36:12.339 --> 00:36:14.408
to steal your investment returns,

00:36:15.642 --> 00:36:17.411
and send them to Mr. Ma instead.

00:36:19.413 --> 00:36:20.314
And then?

00:36:20.514 --> 00:36:21.782
And then Mr. Ma...

00:36:22.449 --> 00:36:24.718
refused to betray you.

00:36:25.252 --> 00:36:28.422
He was furious and made us
come apologize in person.

00:36:41.835 --> 00:36:44.338
Gosh, you fool.

00:36:44.605 --> 00:36:47.774
You'd throw away our trust
for pocket change?

00:36:48.509 --> 00:36:49.543
I'm really sorry.

00:36:50.577 --> 00:36:51.979
Also, sir,

00:36:52.312 --> 00:36:55.549
Mr. Ma has people inside
the prosecutor's office.

00:36:56.950 --> 00:36:58.952
I've got a man in the prosecution.

00:36:59.453 --> 00:37:02.022
I'll make sure today's case...

00:37:02.022 --> 00:37:03.123
gets dismissed.

00:37:05.993 --> 00:37:09.029
We've only talked on the phone,
but you're already proving reliable.

00:37:09.630 --> 00:37:10.464
Thank you, sir.

00:37:10.964 --> 00:37:12.299
Thanks.

00:37:12.866 --> 00:37:13.867
I appreciate it.

00:37:15.402 --> 00:37:17.571
I suppose I should return the favor.

00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:20.574
Does that mean...

00:37:21.008 --> 00:37:22.242
I'll reach out to Chairman Ahn...

00:37:23.110 --> 00:37:25.913
and put in a good word for you.

00:37:35.889 --> 00:37:36.757
Thank you, sir.

00:37:47.768 --> 00:37:51.405
Genie Tourism Development probably emailed
you the contract details.

00:37:51.939 --> 00:37:54.408
You can take a look.

00:37:54.775 --> 00:37:57.411
When the deal closes,

00:37:57.411 --> 00:38:00.280
don't forget our investment agreement.

00:38:07.888 --> 00:38:10.023
(Request: cooperation on resort
development investment and bonus payouts)

00:38:11.625 --> 00:38:12.659
(Meeting venue)

00:38:12.659 --> 00:38:15.062
(Rococo Hall, second floor,
Genie Sky Hotel, Tiong Bahru, Singapore)

00:38:18.265 --> 00:38:19.533
(Connection failed)

00:38:20.934 --> 00:38:21.768
What the hell?

00:38:26.607 --> 00:38:27.474
Damn it.

00:38:44.625 --> 00:38:45.826
(Ma Seok Gu)

00:38:46.527 --> 00:38:47.327
Yes, boss.

00:38:47.928 --> 00:38:49.997
Hey, take them back to Seungam-sa Temple.

00:38:50.931 --> 00:38:52.633
What? You just said...

00:38:53.133 --> 00:38:55.235
to take them to Wari Port.

00:38:55.235 --> 00:38:58.205
You little shit, talk back again
and you'll be the one getting dumped.

00:38:58.672 --> 00:39:00.140
Do it now!

00:39:00.507 --> 00:39:01.842
Yes, sir.

00:39:12.052 --> 00:39:15.622
Congressman Seo, I received your email.

00:39:16.223 --> 00:39:20.093
Mr. Ma, are you on your way?
Where are you?

00:39:20.093 --> 00:39:21.361
Yes, I'm on my way.

00:39:21.895 --> 00:39:23.830
I just passed Seongan Bridge.

00:39:25.332 --> 00:39:26.300
I see.

00:39:26.900 --> 00:39:28.168
Everything’s okay, right?

00:39:29.369 --> 00:39:30.938
Sorry? What do you mean?

00:39:32.539 --> 00:39:35.309
Everything's still fine?

00:39:36.009 --> 00:39:37.110
I don't know what you mean.

00:39:56.263 --> 00:39:58.065
Thank you, Do Jin.

00:39:58.332 --> 00:40:01.168
I was terrified cursing him out like that.

00:40:01.168 --> 00:40:03.303
But I did okay, right? Not bad acting.

00:40:03.303 --> 00:40:05.072
I don't look too bad.

00:40:05.072 --> 00:40:06.573
Maybe I should be an actor.

00:41:13.207 --> 00:41:16.743
You're awake, Mr. Ma.

00:41:16.743 --> 00:41:17.711
Mr. Ma?

00:41:17.711 --> 00:41:19.513
Are you badly hurt?

00:41:21.582 --> 00:41:24.685
Fuck, Wei Chang Yu, you fucking bitch!

00:41:25.752 --> 00:41:27.955
I'll call the police and an ambulance.

00:41:30.090 --> 00:41:30.991
No.

00:41:31.658 --> 00:41:32.626
Don't.

00:41:33.293 --> 00:41:34.728
Don't you dare, you psycho!

00:41:34.962 --> 00:41:36.797
Right.

00:41:37.564 --> 00:41:40.133
Word is you're on the wanted list.

00:41:40.133 --> 00:41:41.235
- Is that right?
- Damn it.

00:41:41.235 --> 00:41:43.036
If I report you, you're screwed.

00:41:43.403 --> 00:41:45.138
Maybe I should call the chairman instead?

00:41:46.306 --> 00:41:47.307
Fuck!

00:41:48.041 --> 00:41:49.877
Will you shut the fuck up?

00:41:50.444 --> 00:41:51.712
Just joking.

00:41:52.513 --> 00:41:53.747
By the way,

00:41:53.747 --> 00:41:56.984
I wonder if Chairman Kim knows
he's down $5 million.

00:41:56.984 --> 00:41:58.619
- Shit.
- Relax.

00:41:59.052 --> 00:42:02.189
We've got that $5 million safe and sound.

00:42:05.092 --> 00:42:05.993
(Meeting venue)

00:42:05.993 --> 00:42:06.760
(Connection failed)

00:42:06.994 --> 00:42:08.662
(Seongan Bridge)

00:42:12.499 --> 00:42:14.268
(Cryzeon coin transaction)
(Withdrawal - maximum)

00:42:14.268 --> 00:42:16.103
(Withdrawal completed
- five million dollars)

00:42:16.870 --> 00:42:18.238
Got it.

00:42:19.139 --> 00:42:20.440
Sorry about that.

00:42:21.008 --> 00:42:23.410
This is all I know from being a thug.

00:42:24.244 --> 00:42:25.412
You little shit.

00:42:26.413 --> 00:42:29.483
You and that son of a bitch,

00:42:29.483 --> 00:42:31.919
you're both dead.

00:42:31.919 --> 00:42:35.489
You're still worrying about others
when you're half-dead?

00:42:36.023 --> 00:42:36.890
Don't worry.

00:42:37.491 --> 00:42:40.093
See you in hell, you son of a bitch.

00:42:40.093 --> 00:42:40.928
Hey.

00:42:41.795 --> 00:42:42.696
Hey!

00:42:44.131 --> 00:42:45.832
You bastard!

00:42:46.266 --> 00:42:48.936
Fuck!

00:43:27.241 --> 00:43:29.576
(No Mercy)

00:43:30.043 --> 00:43:31.712
Watch your back from here on out.

00:43:31.712 --> 00:43:33.714
hey'll come after you.

00:43:33.714 --> 00:43:35.883
You know that guy from earlier, right?

00:43:36.316 --> 00:43:38.218
So I couldn't really see his face.

00:43:38.218 --> 00:43:40.053
But he had this weird tattoo on his neck.

00:43:40.053 --> 00:43:41.889
A man went missing...

00:43:41.889 --> 00:43:43.423
near Seongan Bridge last night.

00:43:43.423 --> 00:43:44.258
Missing?

00:43:44.258 --> 00:43:46.693
I think it's Ma Seok Gu.

00:43:46.693 --> 00:43:50.063
By the time you find him,
my money will already be gone.

00:43:50.063 --> 00:43:52.933
Bring me the real thief.

00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:55.302
Are you sure it's Ma Seok Gu?

00:43:55.302 --> 00:43:57.237
Your life could be in danger.

00:43:57.237 --> 00:43:58.405
Then why?

00:43:59.173 --> 00:44:00.741
He's been lurking around.

00:44:01.708 --> 00:44:02.609
Jeong Hun.

00:44:03.377 --> 00:44:04.978
Where in Korea...

00:44:05.479 --> 00:44:06.446
could Ma Seok Gu be hiding?

00:44:07.749 --> 00:44:09.749
