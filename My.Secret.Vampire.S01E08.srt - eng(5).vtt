So you're not a cultist?

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:43.590
You're not planning to
become a saint, right?

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:44.370
Do you like garlic?

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.640
Do you have good eyesight?

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.250

Is this what you wanted to do?

I guess you really
didn't want to take the photo.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.570
There are lasers coming out of your eyes.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.680
That camera is weird.

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:22.520
I've got to keep it.

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.200
I think you need to be honest.

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.480
Because I'm bad at hiding my emotions.

You're not afraid of me finding out

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:41.790
but of getting hurt.

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:42.380
But...

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.430

What were you thinking
on your way back here?

When was this?

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:28.090
My birthday party.

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:41.280
Why do you look like
you were going to cry?

00:07:42.159 --> 00:07:45.020
There weren't kids around my age

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:48.670
and those who attended
were old people.

00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:50.520
I see.

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:55.590
I cried a lot when I was that young too.

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:58.780
Why?

00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:01.390
Because I didn't want to drink blood.

00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:07.100
I didn't know I was a vampire.

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:10.790
Is that... possible?

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:15.720
When Godfather found me,

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:19.270
I was very sick.

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:26.180
To save me, he turned me into a vampire.

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:28.120

That day,

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:36.280
I was afraid your wound might be poisoned,

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:37.110
so I wanted to remove the poison—

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:43.490
Hyung. Are you tired now?

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:47.640
No. Why?

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:56.630
When I was a kid,

00:08:56.630 --> 00:09:00.290
I loved lying down here
to look at the sky.

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:08.930
What is that star?

00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:14.610
It's not like living in the countryside
makes me a professor of constellations.

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:18.330
I don't even know if it's a star
or space trash.

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:20.180
But, so what?

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:24.780
It's pretty. That's all that matters.

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:27.180
Pretty.

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:40.580
Oh. How did you find that...

00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:43.460
It found its owner.

00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:54.520

00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:03.770
Why would you keep wearing it?

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:04.770
I said I'm fine.

00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:06.750
No, give it to me.

00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:35.530
To be honest,

00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:40.920

I wanted to be honest with you
as you said.

00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:06.930
That's why I came to look for you
after plucking up my courage.

Of course. That's our home.
