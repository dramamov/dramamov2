00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:33.700
So you've decided to stand by her?

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:35.820
Princess Tianji.

00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:38.460
What lies between us is only a fair deal,

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:39.770
nothing more.

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:41.940
I've already made that clear.

00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:44.010
But if my father insists

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:46.850
on granting you and me in marriage,

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:49.340
will you defy the decree?

00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:56.250
His Majesty's been in a deep sleep for years.

00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:58.420
Lord Hanfeng's influence is at its peak.

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:01.100
These days, the entire Jixing Palace

00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:03.250
likely regards him as their true ruler.

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:05.220
I may be no more

00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:06.820
than a newcomer, but I've risen fast.

00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:10.700
A fallen princess and a rising power.

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:11.890
Do you think

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:13.650
Lord Hanfeng will let you

00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:15.220
get your hands on that decree?

00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:16.530
Ji Bozai,

00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:18.100
don't forget it was me

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:20.300
who freed you from the prisoner's brand.

00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:27.530
Yes,

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:29.650
you did me a great kindness.

00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:32.700
But I won't repay it with marriage.

00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:35.010
For you,

00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:37.650
a warrior who can win the Qingyun Tournament

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:40.460
means far more than any consort,

00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:41.340
doesn't it?

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:52.370
Of course.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.890
I ask that you lend me your strength.

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:06.100
I'll be taking her with me.

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:11.460
And remember this, Your Highness.

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:16.890
If anyone dares to harm my Ming Yi again,

00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:18.890
even if it's the Emperor himself,

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:21.300
I'll kill whoever does.

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:28.250
Your Highness!

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:29.770
How could he speak to you like that!

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:34.180
It doesn't matter how he treats me

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:35.220
or what he feels.

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:37.250
What matters is that for now,

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:39.100
he hasn't joined my uncle's faction.

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:40.370
That's enough for me.

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:44.730
Immortal.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.010
All the ladies on duty today are here.

00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:49.130
Who would you like to perform for you?

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:06.420
Which of you

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:09.300
is Ji Bozai's favored?

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:11.130
Immortal Ji's favored lady?

00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:14.180
- That's me. - It's me.

00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:15.850
No, it's me!

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:17.530
You're wrong. It's me.

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:36.580
They say once,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:37.890
two immortals

00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:39.940
chased a fairy through Moonlit Blossoms.

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:43.180
Ji Bozai stepped in

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:44.300
and claimed she was his.

00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:46.770
- Who? - I don't know who that is.

00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:47.530
If any of you

00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:49.370
can identify that fairy,

00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:50.700
these treasures

00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:52.460
are yours.

00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:00.060
I really can't be sure.

00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:02.180
Every fairy here

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:03.770
admires Immortal Ji.

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:06.940
He has made far too many companions.

00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:08.460
You must have already asked

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:10.610
the owner of Moonlit Blossoms when you arrived.

00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:12.300
If she doesn't know,

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.610
how could we?

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:17.420
That's right.

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:18.700
How would we know?

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:20.130
We don't know.

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:21.940
- I have no idea. - Me too.

00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:23.730
Sir?

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:30.700
When did he leave?

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:31.250
Where did he go?

00:15:31.270 --> 00:15:32.130
He's gone.

00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:38.550
[Dual Cultivation Manual]

00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:39.370
Seriously?

00:15:39.390 --> 00:15:40.820
Is this the sort of stuff you read?

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:45.130
Well, if I want to deal with that philanderer,

00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:46.340
I need the right medicine.

00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:48.610
Then, why don't you just slip him a drug?

00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:51.300
I'd love to,

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:52.890
but he's too cautious.

00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:53.940
He never eats food from others.

00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:56.650
All right. Enough teasing.

00:15:56.670 --> 00:15:57.700
How have you been?

00:15:58.080 --> 00:15:59.460
How's that waist injury of yours?

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:00.650
How's the medicine I gave you?

00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:11.940
What do you think?

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:12.980
Impressive, right?

00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:17.130
As expected of you, Zhang Tai.

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:21.770
What's wrong?

00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:23.370
Why aren't you getting back up?

00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:25.890
Help...

00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:28.370
I'm stuck...

00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:29.940
Are you serious?

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:33.820
Ow...

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:35.100
Bear with it.

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:36.300
You've only yourself to blame for showing off.

00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:38.370
Well, I thought I was all better...

00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:43.100
There's something you should know.

00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:45.890
Yesterday, a guest came by.

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:48.850
He wasn't there for entertainment or pleasure.

00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:50.850
Rather, he inquired about the incident

00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:52.700
when you were pursued by those two immortals.

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:54.420
What did he look like?

00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:58.850
Tall,

00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:00.650
handsome,

00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:01.940
thin.

00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:03.700
That isn't helpful.

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:05.330
I didn't even see him, all right?

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.570
He hid behind a screen.

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:10.220
He obviously had ill intentions,

00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:12.860
so I covered for you.

00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:14.860
Thanks.

00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:18.180
He was so secretive.

00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:22.050
You don't think he's a warrior, do you?

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:25.530
He must be.

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:27.530
A warrior who trespasses into another realm

00:17:27.550 --> 00:17:28.570
and gets caught

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:30.220
is as good as dead.

Rub here for me again.

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:38.380
What's wrong?

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:39.180
Nothing.

00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:41.380
He didn't touch a drop of wine that day,

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:42.570
but he did

00:17:42.790 --> 00:17:44.050
take a bite of a chestnut cake.

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:49.700
Chestnut cake...

00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:52.420
It's that idiot.

00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:54.900
I'm heading back!

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:00.980
They make a fine pair.

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:11.250
You didn't have to send her off with me.

00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:13.460
Well, she's a friend of the mistress of Wugui Sea.

00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:14.570
It was her first visit.

00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:16.860
I can at least observe that courtesy.

00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:19.570
As expected of the man of the household.

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:31.380
Today has been good.

The weather.

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:48.420
The weather's good.

00:18:50.790 --> 00:18:51.570
Good?

00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:53.290
It looks like it's about to pour.

I'd say thunder's on the way too.

he was in close contact with the warden of the Sunken Abyss.

Perhaps

00:20:58.270 --> 00:20:59.940
his disappearance's linked to the Sunken Abyss.

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:57.570
getting him to hand over the Golden Millet Dream of his own accord.

00:21:58.590 --> 00:21:59.460
I forgot

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:01.250
that if he holds the Golden Millet Dream,

00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:04.570
his ties to Bo Yulan must run deep.

00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:05.840
With Situ Ling's arrival

00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:07.250
and Your Lordship's impending retirement,

00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:09.010
a banquet is in order.

00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:10.770
Why not invite

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.180
Ji Bozai tomorrow

00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:13.460
and test him?

00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:16.980
If Ji Bozai is involved

00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:19.660
with Bo Yulan,

00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:23.700
then he mustn't be kept alive.

00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:44.810
You didn't have to come tonight.

00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:49.140
How could I skip

00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:50.330
Lord Hanfeng's banquet?

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:51.380
My point is,

00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:53.010
since the former chief went missing,

00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:55.090
Mu Qibai's been managing the Judgment Hall.

00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:56.050
Today's only

00:22:56.350 --> 00:22:57.940
a farewell banquet.

00:22:58.790 --> 00:23:00.420
You only share this with me

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:02.010
after I'm already on board.

00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:03.380
I'd have thought

00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:05.090
you were warning me

00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:06.420
in case something happened.

00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:11.940
Who's the new Chief

00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:12.730
of the Judgment Hall?

00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:14.220
They say his name's Situ Ling.

00:23:15.550 --> 00:23:16.570
What's he like?

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:18.050
I haven't seen him either.

00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:20.460
Heard he's just a sly fox.

00:23:21.070 --> 00:23:22.140
He was expected

00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:23.770
at tonight's farewell,

00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:25.570
but suddenly declined,

00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:26.730
claiming he was too tired from work

00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:28.980
to drink or indulge in pleasure,

00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:29.940
so he excused himself.

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:34.730
You should've used that excuse too.

00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:36.460
I'm not going to miss it.

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:38.250
Things that must be faced

00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:39.660
should be faced.

00:23:42.690 --> 00:23:43.440
I get it.

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:47.090
You're worried Lord Hanfeng will foist someone on you.

00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:48.460
That's why you brought me along.

00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:49.250
Yes.

00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:52.300
I prefer not to have others push people onto me.

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:54.060
I like to make my own choices.

00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:11.300
Lord Ji,

00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:13.930
the night Lord Hanfeng came to Wugui Sea,

00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:15.730
I accidentally knocked over a box

00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:17.490
in your room.

00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:20.010
A broken iron fan fell out.

00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:21.450
I wondered

00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:22.780
why you'd keep

00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:23.860
such a thing.

00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:25.730
Could it be

00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:27.930
some fairy left it with you?

00:24:30.030 --> 00:24:31.380
That was Ming Xian's weapon.

00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:35.690
Then, why'd you keep it?

00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:37.970
Ming Xian was defeated,

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:39.340
and you wanted to keep it as a prize?

00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:46.970
He really is,

00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:50.650
as the rumors claim,

00:24:51.230 --> 00:24:52.860
an incredibly gifted warrior.

00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:56.170
At one point,

00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:58.100
I thought he might even defeat me.

00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:00.250
But for some reason,

00:25:01.030 --> 00:25:03.170
his spiritual power seemed to fail all at once.

00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:06.010
I could hardly draw back my own power then

00:25:06.430 --> 00:25:07.650
and almost killed him.

00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:17.690
Luckily, his weapon saved him.

00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:19.540
I kept it.

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:23.250
I thought I'd return it if we met

00:25:25.750 --> 00:25:26.620
on the battlefield again.

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:33.620
What brought this up?

00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:35.450
Pretend you didn't hear what I said.

00:25:38.030 --> 00:25:40.380
He didn't sound like he was lying.

00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:43.140
Could he not be the one who poisoned me

00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:44.580
with Heavenly Grief?

00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:12.540
If it wasn't him,

00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:14.690
then...

00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:16.930
who would've done it?

00:26:23.190 --> 00:26:23.930
We've arrived.

00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:57.380
- Here. - This is

00:26:58.920 --> 00:26:59.860
for you, Ji.

00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:11.540
See?

00:27:11.670 --> 00:27:13.170
Someone's watching over me now.

00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:14.730
Ming Yi won't let me drink.

00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:15.900
Ming Yi,

00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:18.100
how about you drink this cup for me?

00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:25.300
I can't possibly let Immortal Yan toast me.

00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:27.250
I should be the one to toast Immortal Yan.

00:27:36.270 --> 00:27:38.820
I've never seen you consume anything while you're outside, Ji.

00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:40.210
Why's that?

00:27:44.470 --> 00:27:45.540
Nonsense.

00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:47.100
He eats like a pig

00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:48.340
at Moonlit Blossoms every time.

00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:49.100
Look at him...

00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:00.450
Work with me here.

00:28:04.190 --> 00:28:05.690
Lord Hanfeng has arrived.

00:28:11.510 --> 00:28:13.450
Greetings, Lord Hanfeng.

00:28:14.230 --> 00:28:15.780
Spare me the formality.

00:28:16.270 --> 00:28:17.540
Haven't I said before?

00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:18.620
From now on,

00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:20.210
you should all follow Bozai's example.

00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:22.010
Well?

00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:22.970
Put those arms down.

00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:24.250
Put them down.

00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:31.100
Today, I had a room cleared for our new chief.

00:28:31.470 --> 00:28:32.620
Guess what we found.

00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:53.450
In Hou Zhao's old quarters,

00:28:53.710 --> 00:28:56.060
we found a portrait of a beauty.

00:28:57.320 --> 00:28:58.900
What an exquisitely painted beauty.

00:28:59.510 --> 00:29:01.380
Might she be Hou Zhao's lover?

00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:05.620
Hou Zhao's gone missing.

00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:09.250
Could he have eloped with this fairy?

00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:11.100
Everyone,

00:29:11.270 --> 00:29:12.250
take a good look.

00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:15.010
Does anyone recognize the fairy in the painting?

00:29:15.270 --> 00:29:16.580
What magic was used to paint this portrait?

00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:18.340
She even moves.

00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:21.490
To be captured by such a rare technique,

00:29:22.270 --> 00:29:23.580
she must be special.

00:29:24.510 --> 00:29:26.300
Ji, you're acquainted with fairies from every realm.

00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:27.340
Take a good look.

00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:29.060
Do you know her?

00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:34.450
Even if I used to be close to many fairies,

00:29:34.470 --> 00:29:35.820
that's all in the past.

00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:42.300
Now, my heart holds only Ming Yi.

00:29:46.670 --> 00:29:47.970
Now that Ji's settled down,

00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:49.690
even he's afraid of his beloved.

00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:51.930
The fairy in the portrait

00:29:52.270 --> 00:29:55.010
looks like someone you would favor.

00:29:56.190 --> 00:29:58.380
Ji, are you sure you don't recognize her?

00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:06.650
Maybe you should take a closer look.

00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:21.100
Immortal Ji claims he doesn't know her.

00:30:21.270 --> 00:30:22.250
Let me take a look.

00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:27.690
This fairy's quite voluptuous.

00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:29.170
Let me see too.

00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:31.620
With lips like cherries,

00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:33.210
it wouldn't be a waste

00:30:33.270 --> 00:30:34.300
to have a taste.

00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:40.340
Such a divine technique that allows

00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:42.540
the fairy in the portrait to move.

00:30:43.710 --> 00:30:45.210
If it could switch poses,

00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:47.540
wouldn't that be even better?

00:30:51.190 --> 00:30:53.250
A man's mind holds vast valleys and flowing rivers.

00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:56.250
A beauty's smile topples cities.

00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:58.650
In moonlight, neck to neck, intertwined.

00:31:00.670 --> 00:31:03.730
Longing stirs...

00:31:04.750 --> 00:31:06.010
- Immortal Sun! - Are you all right?

00:31:06.190 --> 00:31:07.620
If you can't handle your liquor, don't drink so much.

00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:15.860
Who threw that cup?

00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:21.380
You did it.

00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:23.250
You did that on purpose!

00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:24.210
What's this?

00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:25.860
Now that you feel protected,

00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:26.930
you're getting a bit too bold, huh?

00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:29.340
Get up!

00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:32.440
You...

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:33.600
What...

00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:47.540
Immortal Ji.

00:31:48.190 --> 00:31:50.140
Both you and Sun Liao fought in the Qingyun Tournament.

00:31:50.710 --> 00:31:51.690
This is excessive.

00:31:58.470 --> 00:32:00.490
How'd it go from me eating a piece of melon

00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:02.010
to you two fighting?

00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:05.780
Enough.

00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:09.300
Immortal Ji, are you this angry

00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:11.250
for the beauty by your side

00:32:12.430 --> 00:32:14.060
or for the fairy in the portrait?

00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:34.540
Lord Hanfeng,

00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:35.690
it's all my fault.

00:32:36.190 --> 00:32:38.900
I knocked the cup over

00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:41.010
and embarrassed Immortal Sun Liao.

00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:42.340
Lord Ji has no fault to bear.

00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:44.490
I ruined everyone's mood.

00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:45.970
Please punish me instead.

00:32:46.750 --> 00:32:47.450
Get up.

00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:53.780
You've done nothing wrong. There's no reason for you to kneel.

00:32:55.990 --> 00:32:57.140
Lord Hanfeng, you're mistaken.

00:32:59.470 --> 00:33:00.820
What I did just now

00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:03.580
was to protect the one I love.

00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:06.140
Should you find your true love one day,

00:33:06.510 --> 00:33:07.490
you'll understand.

00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:12.970
We won't be staying in this dull place

00:33:13.670 --> 00:33:14.730
crawling with scoundrels.

00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:17.930
Farewell.

00:33:17.950 --> 00:33:18.540
I...

00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:47.210
I did that on purpose.

00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:51.580
I know.

00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:56.580
Did I cause you trouble?

00:34:04.270 --> 00:34:05.100
Lord Ji...

00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:09.700
Don't move.

00:34:11.590 --> 00:34:12.610
Don't worry about them.

00:34:13.550 --> 00:34:14.700
After I take you back,

00:34:15.030 --> 00:34:16.180
I still have business to handle.

00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:17.860
You should get some rest.

00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:38.610
He's rather good at this.

00:34:58.590 --> 00:34:59.220
Ming Yi!

00:34:59.590 --> 00:35:00.380
Stop spacing out.

00:35:00.630 --> 00:35:01.700
The worm reacted.

00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:04.010
Perfect. Ji Bozai's away too.

00:35:04.030 --> 00:35:04.610
Let's go!

00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:16.820
This is where the pavilion in the back mountain used to be.

00:35:17.070 --> 00:35:18.010
The pavilion?

00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:19.900
The one you burned?

00:35:22.110 --> 00:35:24.450
Burned it so thoroughly not a trace is left.

00:35:26.630 --> 00:35:28.570
Why did it bring us here?

00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:33.900
Nothing's happening.

00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:41.780
That's enough. Let me do it.

00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:50.180
A familiar sensation...

00:36:03.550 --> 00:36:05.490
Ji Bozai hid the Spirit Well here.

00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:07.260
The Spirit Well?

00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:08.180
Impossible.

00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:10.820
His power's even stronger than I thought.

00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:12.260
He's already reached the point

00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:14.930
where he can turn the Spirit Well into a real location.

00:36:15.990 --> 00:36:17.970
He's picked himself one heck of a treasure vault.

00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:21.380
And I've already burned the place.

00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:23.490
Yet Ji Bozai didn't even mention it?

00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:25.220
Guess he thinks we're suspicious

00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:26.300
and doesn't want to tip his hand early.

00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:28.090
Wait. What do you mean he hasn't said anything?

00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:29.530
Didn't he send me away?

00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:31.660
If it wasn't for my quick thinking,

00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:32.490
who would've

00:36:32.510 --> 00:36:34.780
cleaned up this mess for you!

00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:37.860
Oh...

00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:40.180
So, this is the Spirit...

00:36:41.390 --> 00:36:43.740
This is the Spirit Well, huh?

00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:45.130
Twenty-Seven,

00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:48.010
you've learned to change the subject.

00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:54.860
The worm sensed it.

00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:56.820
That means the Golden Millet Dream's here.

00:36:57.430 --> 00:36:58.820
What to do?

00:37:00.470 --> 00:37:02.970
None but the one who shares Ji Bozai's divine consciousness

00:37:03.110 --> 00:37:05.300
can enter his Spirit Well.

00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:07.740
But you're Ming Xian.

00:37:08.470 --> 00:37:10.010
You're literally the least likely person

00:37:10.030 --> 00:37:12.130
in the Six Realms to share divine consciousness with Ji Bozai.

00:37:16.070 --> 00:37:16.970
Ming Xian can't do it.

00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:18.820
But right now you're Ming Yi,

00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:21.380
the fairy Ji Bozai took from Moonlit Blossoms.

00:37:22.550 --> 00:37:23.610
What are you getting at?

00:37:24.950 --> 00:37:26.130
Rules of the Six Realms.

00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:27.860
When you wed,

00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:30.570
you have to form a heart imprint

00:37:30.590 --> 00:37:31.780
through the Marriage Stone.

00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:34.300
After that, you can share divine consciousness.

00:37:35.070 --> 00:37:35.780
You...

00:37:38.590 --> 00:37:39.660
You don't say.

00:37:40.110 --> 00:37:41.340
That's a shortcut, huh?

00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:42.570
Right?

00:37:42.950 --> 00:37:43.700
Right?

00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:45.010
Sounds easy enough.

00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:47.970
No fighting, no sparring,

00:37:47.990 --> 00:37:49.300
simple as that.

00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:50.930
You just have to marry him.

00:37:50.950 --> 00:37:52.610
- Just marry him... - Easy.

00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:54.380
It should be a piece of cake for you...

00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:55.260
Hold on.

00:37:55.630 --> 00:37:58.380
What about a separation?

00:37:58.590 --> 00:38:00.180
I have to go back to Yaoguang Mountain.

00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:01.300
Is it a hassle to get a separation?

00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:02.220
Easy.

00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:03.900
Trust me.

00:38:04.030 --> 00:38:05.530
When the time comes,

00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:07.450
you just agree to erase each other's names.

00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:10.220
All right. Let's do that.

00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:13.530
When did you learn all this?

00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:17.490
Ji Bozai doesn't look like someone who'd marry you.

00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:20.930
You've got a long road ahead.

00:38:23.470 --> 00:38:25.780
It was hard enough just getting him to take me back to Wugui Sea.

00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:27.660
He wouldn't even marry a princess.

00:38:27.990 --> 00:38:29.660
How am I going to get him to marry me?

00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:35.570
Immortal Ji, are you this angry

00:38:36.110 --> 00:38:37.740
for the beauty by your side

00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:40.530
or for the fairy in the portrait?

00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:47.050
At the banquet,

00:38:47.070 --> 00:38:48.090
Mu Qibai

00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:50.700
took out a portrait.

00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:52.700
Ji Bozai actually seemed to care.

00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:55.860
If I help him out,

00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:58.340
maybe his affection for me will...

00:38:59.110 --> 00:39:00.130
What are you trying to say?

00:39:04.110 --> 00:39:05.780
Story time.

00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:07.740
"Chapter 13,

00:39:08.030 --> 00:39:09.860
Ming Yi breaking into Judgment Hall."

00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:10.380
Come on!

00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:11.530
Wait!

00:39:12.510 --> 00:39:13.260
Hands off.

00:39:15.110 --> 00:39:16.010
There's an array.

00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:18.220
You think

00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:19.900
the Judgment Hall's just a place you can stroll into?

00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:22.050
The array barrier activates at night.

00:39:22.110 --> 00:39:24.130
It'll definitely make a petal fall off your Grief Blossom.

00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:27.490
It's not worth it for a portrait.

00:39:27.950 --> 00:39:30.050
Since Zhang Tai already brought it up,

00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:31.450
Ming Xin probably followed me

00:39:31.470 --> 00:39:32.970
into the Jixing Abyss.

00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:34.300
My movements

00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:35.700
can't stay hidden forever.

00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:38.860
We might as well make sure he doesn't come for nothing.

00:39:38.990 --> 00:39:40.300
Let's give him a surprise.

00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:41.180
If he's here,

00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:43.010
why aren't we running?

00:39:43.110 --> 00:39:44.050
We can't hide forever,

00:39:44.070 --> 00:39:45.570
but at least we can hide for a while.

00:39:45.590 --> 00:39:47.090
Do you think I have that much time left?

00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:49.970
Even so...

00:39:49.990 --> 00:39:50.970
Chapter 14.

00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:53.490
"Ming Yi Takes Risks for Wealth." Come on!

00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:54.010
But...

00:39:54.030 --> 00:39:55.780
What do you mean Ming Yi takes risks for wealth!

00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:56.700
You're living

00:39:56.720 --> 00:39:57.700
the wealthy part!

00:39:57.720 --> 00:39:58.860
I'm the one risking my neck!

00:39:58.950 --> 00:39:59.930
Running here, running there,

00:39:59.950 --> 00:40:01.050
burning this, burning that...

00:40:01.070 --> 00:40:02.180
You're the one enjoying the rewards...

00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:06.900
Don't miss out!

00:40:08.110 --> 00:40:09.490
The Search Mirror makes no mistakes.

00:40:10.110 --> 00:40:12.010
Ming Xian must be in the Jixing Abyss.

00:40:12.990 --> 00:40:14.740
But I can't stay here long.

00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:18.180
If my identity's exposed, it'll be a disaster.

00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:39.360
That looks nice.

00:40:45.740 --> 00:40:46.860
Feel free to take a look.

00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:07.010
Move!

00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:13.050
Stop!

00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:21.660
Your Lordship, let me go to Judgment Hall.

00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:23.820
If Mu Qibai's set a trap,

00:41:24.110 --> 00:41:25.130
it's better I get caught

00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:27.300
than risk exposing your connection to the Golden Millet Dream.

00:41:31.070 --> 00:41:32.930
The fact he brought out my master's portrait already proves

00:41:33.590 --> 00:41:34.930
he's figured it out.

00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:37.930
If I can't even save one portrait,

00:41:38.470 --> 00:41:39.300
then there was

00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:40.930
no point in my clawing my way out of the Sunken Abyss.

00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:43.740
I might as well have stayed there forever as a prisoner.

00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:46.220
But it's my duty to protect you.

00:41:46.590 --> 00:41:47.380
Braving all dangers

00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:48.900
is what I'm supposed to do in your stead.

00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:50.300
If something happens to me, it's nothing.

00:41:50.510 --> 00:41:51.380
But if something happens to you,

00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:52.340
who else can hold things together?

00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:53.490
Let me go.

00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:54.970
You're talking too much. This isn't like you.

00:41:56.590 --> 00:41:57.220
Stop worrying.

00:41:58.360 --> 00:41:59.450
His petty tricks won't do anything

00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:00.970
to me.

00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:09.500
[Judgment Hall]

00:42:52.940 --> 00:42:56.620
[The Sea Stands Tall With Hanging Clouds]

00:43:22.590 --> 00:43:24.450
Lord Ji, it's me.

00:43:25.510 --> 00:43:26.450
What are you doing here?

00:43:27.550 --> 00:43:29.010
I'm here for you.

00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:32.090
Heaven has blessed me.

00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:34.130
Letting him see this chapter 13

00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:35.610
with his own eyes will be easier

00:43:35.630 --> 00:43:36.570
than me trying to explain.

00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:39.130
That portrait at the banquet

00:43:39.470 --> 00:43:41.490
meant a lot to you, didn't it?

00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:43.220
I could tell from one glance.

00:43:44.110 --> 00:43:45.130
You see,

00:43:45.150 --> 00:43:46.340
you took me in.

00:43:46.590 --> 00:43:48.130
I ought to do something for you in return,

00:43:48.150 --> 00:43:48.900
right?

00:43:49.590 --> 00:43:50.860
And that's why you're here?

00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:54.010
You can't catch a tiger cub without entering the tiger's den.

00:43:58.110 --> 00:43:59.570
And how'd you get in?

00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:02.010
The Judgment Hall's array barrier

00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:04.050
isn't something

00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:05.900
an ordinary fairy can just stroll through.

00:44:07.070 --> 00:44:08.530
I didn't exactly stroll in,

00:44:08.550 --> 00:44:09.930
but I did come in fair and square.

00:44:15.990 --> 00:44:17.010
Fair and square?

00:44:17.150 --> 00:44:18.610
You know me.

00:44:19.070 --> 00:44:21.660
You're the one who took me from Moonlit Blossoms.

00:44:24.740 --> 00:44:25.530
All I had to do was...

00:44:26.150 --> 00:44:27.570
Sir...

00:44:29.630 --> 00:44:31.260
Sir, oh, sir...

00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:34.130
There's a wall in the hidden hall

00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:37.300
my father repaired

00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:38.130
ten years ago.

00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:40.380
My mother and I used to come here

00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:41.740
to keep him company.

00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:44.180
But I was such a brat back then.

00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:46.300
I grabbed both their hands

00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:47.570
and pressed them into the wall.

00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:49.860
Now, there's a handprint of all three of us.

00:44:51.030 --> 00:44:54.010
Today's the anniversary of their deaths.

00:44:54.030 --> 00:44:56.260
I just wanted to come in and see them.

00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:56.820
I...

00:44:57.110 --> 00:44:57.930
I...

00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:03.180
And they opened a gap in the array for me,

00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:03.970
and I came in.

00:45:19.630 --> 00:45:21.220
Did that boy do this?

Kitten,

00:45:31.070 --> 00:45:33.010
once you fall into my hands...

00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:19.700
Idiot.

00:46:26.990 --> 00:46:29.860
Be sure to get out of here fast

00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:30.820
when that idiot wakes.

00:46:30.990 --> 00:46:34.610
I'll get someone to haul him off.

How did you even know something was on that wall?

00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:49.010
I lied.

00:46:49.030 --> 00:46:49.970
There's nothing on that wall.

00:46:51.590 --> 00:46:52.660
And they believed you?

00:46:57.400 --> 00:46:59.570
Well, I added a little performance.

00:47:01.070 --> 00:47:03.570
I tugged at my collar just a bit.

00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:04.740
They couldn't resist my charms...

00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:06.220
That's enough.

00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:06.970
