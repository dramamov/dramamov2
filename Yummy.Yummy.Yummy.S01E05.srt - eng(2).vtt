00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.240
(Yunshui Manor)

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:47.180
Today, after court,

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.680
people from
the Ministry of Rites mentioned

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:49.900
Princess Fuhui will still hold

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.080
the Qixi Poetry Gathering this year.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:52.550
She will invite scholars and notables.

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:54.460
If we could use it

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:55.700
to socialize with the Princess,

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:57.620
it would not seem deliberate.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.940
Yes,

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.220
I heard that the Princess's invitations

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.060
are always arbitrary.

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.680
In previous years, she even invited
the Liu family from Guixiang Tavern.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.820
She has no prejudice
against merchant families.

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.620
But why does she specifically avoid

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:10.540
sending invitations
to our Capital Prefecture?

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.140
After Father left,

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.390
several Capital Prefects in a row
didn't last long

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.220
and had no interest in socializing.

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:17.500
I suppose

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.300
they drifted apart from the Princess.

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:20.580
How about

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:21.620
I directly request one

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:22.860
on your behalf?

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:24.900
Requesting an invitation ourselves

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:26.880
would seem like trying
to climb the social ladder,

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.350
and it would be too conspicuous.

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:29.700
Befriending nobles

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.140
should be as natural as possible.

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:34.540
I will think of another way.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.020
Where is the tea brewing stove?

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.700
Late last night,

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.020
the Shen family borrowed
many things from our residence.

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.860
They said it's better than
what they used for their stall before.

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:49.140
Didn't you instruct yesterday

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.020
that the kitchen
would be open for their use?

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:52.560
I thought about it and gave it to them.

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:55.820
I'm working to overturn the Cui case,

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:56.860
and my future is uncertain.

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.380
Even if we publicly say
the Shen family is a distant relative,

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:00.660
if something happens one day,

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:02.500
they might still be implicated.

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.100
Young Master, your intention is

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:05.860
to terminate the engagement early

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:07.220
and send them out of Yong'an, right?

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.460
Lady Shen isn't fixated
on the engagement.

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.220
They came to Yunshui Manor
seeking refuge

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:14.620
just to give their family

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:15.940
a temporary place to stay.

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:17.300
They also said

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:18.830
they really want to return
to their hometown.

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.540
Well, isn't that perfect?

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.180
When the Cui family incident happened,

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.060
the Shen family

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.380
must have been implicated, too.

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:28.580
Even if Lady Shen doesn't mention it,

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:29.900
I can't pretend not to know.

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.300
Even if we send them away,

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.060
I should fulfill my responsibility

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.700
to ensure their future livelihood.

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:37.860
How about

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:39.580
giving them a sum of money?

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.780
That would seem like
we are trying to drive them away.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.750
It's better to teach someone to fish
than to give them fish.

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:48.420
They have a hard time in business.

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:49.540
We should support them more.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:51.100
Liu Chang,

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.420
please watch over them diligently.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:53.660
If they need anything,

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:54.660
provide it.

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:55.700
Understood.

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:59.220
They have already...

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:02.980
taken everything.

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:04.900
The flat pan for frying tea,

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:06.020
the stove with charcoal,

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:07.140
and even...

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:08.060
the salt,

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:09.420
all borrowed.

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.860
They certainly...

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:17.380
were polite.

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.540
(Jianbing)

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.860
Daughter,

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:27.460
listen, our ancestor's things

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:28.500
are truly good.

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:29.620
Look at this charcoal fire,

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:30.900
it doesn't smoke

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:31.940
and doesn't choke people.

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:35.620
Come take a look.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:37.940
Yong'an's one-of-a-kind

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:38.940
Jianbing Guozi!

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:40.700
One qian per piece.

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:43.380
The only Jianbing Guozi in the dynasty,

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.180
back on the market!

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:46.860
Guaranteed not to disappoint!

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:47.700
Come here...

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.920
Don't miss out as you pass by!

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.770
- Here, take a look.
- Hurry up, or it will be sold out.

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:52.580
Take a look.

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:53.420
No need, no need.

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:55.700
I am baffled.

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.140
In such a short time,

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:58.380
have they already

00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:59.260
gotten tired of it?

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:02.180
Jianbing Guozi...

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:04.660
It smells so good.

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:06.620
Inside, there are eggs and sesame.

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:08.860
- Truly a delicacy in the world.
- Dad!

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.460
I know. I see it.

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:13.730
Where did their Jianbing Guozi
come from?

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:14.660
(Yunlai Tavern)

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.340
- Jianbing Guozi!
- Here you go.

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.660
Special offer in Juxian Alley,
three pieces for one qian!

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:19.900
- Rare to taste!
- Got it.

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:22.740
- Sweet or savory?
- Here they are.

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.180
That place also sells
Jianbing Guozi? Let's go.

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:27.660
Take care.

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:31.500
Three pieces for one qian,
take your pick!

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:32.680
- Here is one for you.
- Take this.

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:33.700
Here you are.

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.020
Everyone,

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:35.860
three pieces for one qian.

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.940
Three pieces for one qian!

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.340
Good quality and cheap.
Three pieces for one coin!

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:41.750
Good quality and cheap.

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:42.620
Three pieces for one coin!

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:43.540
Look,

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:44.700
isn't this our Jianbing Guozi?

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:47.340
It's yours.

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:49.380
- Good, thank you.
- Give it to me.

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:50.250
Give it to me quickly.

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:51.980
How shameless

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:52.820
for such a big tavern

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:54.020
to copy us!

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:55.100
How dare they?

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:57.140
Everyone, don't crowd!

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:59.460
To make money, there is nothing
to be embarrassed about.

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:00.460
What should we do?

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:01.500
They copied ours,

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:02.700
and their price is lower.

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:04.900
Then, should we lower our price, too?

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:07.140
They must have
cheaper supplies than we do.

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:08.900
We have no advantage in a price war.

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:11.100
If we have no advantage,

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:12.620
then...

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:21.700
(Virtue and Fragrance)

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:23.180
These are the Jianbing Guozi

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:24.860
Yunlai Tavern copied from us.

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:26.940
I bought back all the flavors.

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:28.400
Let us taste them
to see what they are like.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:30.150
Here, Yangyang.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:42.260
It's a chicken cutlet!

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:43.980
Delicious!

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:47.140
The taste is indeed good.

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:48.460
Inside, it has...

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:56.300
Actually, if you taste it carefully,

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:58.060
the flavor is just average.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:06:59.540
Still slightly inferior

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:00.780
to ours.

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:03.780
But this Jianbing Guozi itself

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:05.780
has no technical difficulty.

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:07.140
With a little effort,

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:08.380
it can be imitated quickly.

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:10.420
Who says it has no technical difficulty?

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:16.540
Vice Prefect!

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:17.380
Vice Prefect.

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:18.820
Is this

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:20.220
a full pancake feast?

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:23.140
Vice Prefect,

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:25.060
quickly, sit down.

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:26.980
Sit down!

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:32.340
Vice Prefect, try this.

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:38.380
Okay.

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:43.260
Mr. Liu,

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:45.340
here, have a taste, too.

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:46.340
Auntie, thank you.

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:47.180
You are welcome.

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:55.580
For this pancake,

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:57.100
the outer egg skin is soft and tender,

00:07:57.460 --> 00:07:59.220
but the inside, like fried dough twists,

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:00.100
is very crispy.

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:01.700
Tastes wonderful!

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:06.060
What do you think?

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:07.540
Delicious.

00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:19.860
Didn't

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:20.740
today's stall sale

00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:22.220
go well?

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:23.860
No,

00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:25.580
these are all made

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:26.980
by Yunlai Tavern.

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:28.580
They copied us,

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:29.900
and no one stops them.

00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:31.020
Vice Prefect,

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:33.100
you must uphold justice for us.

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:34.420
Yes,

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:35.780
you're in charge of justice.

00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:37.140
Is there no law

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:38.820
to restrain them?

00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:42.820
Don't worry, Vice Prefect.

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:44.380
We can handle it.

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:47.300
Besides, to make money in business,

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:49.700
you always face all kinds of troubles.

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:51.180
We are fine.

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:53.900
Actually, this pancake

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:55.420
is nothing special.

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:57.220
Liu Chang, isn't that right?

00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:04.380
Upon careful tasting,

00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:05.700
this pancake still has...

00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:08.380
Lady Shen, your family pancake

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:09.260
has more chewiness

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:10.380
and aftertaste.

00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:12.500
Uncle Liu Chang,

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:13.860
you are lying, aren't you?

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.300
Uncle Liu Chang?

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:19.820
- It's just...
- Don't comfort us.

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:22.940
Once Yunlai Tavern
starts following trends,

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:24.740
soon all of Juxian Alley will imitate.

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:26.820
The market will saturate quickly.

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:28.860
We must switch tracks
as soon as possible.

What is the market?

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:32.940
And...

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:34.300
what are tracks?

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:38.140
Just some terms we invented.

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:39.020
Simply put,

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:40.270
it means selling something different.

they have started selling Lamb Skewers.

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:46.620
They came up with some new tricks

00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:48.140
and drew people away.

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:49.740
Usually,

such a big bunch of Lamb Skewers

00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:52.780
would cost about 30 or 40 qian.

addressing each other like that

00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:02.860
seems distant.

Calling you Yan

00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:05.740

which offered free tastings,

00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:34.260
is now selling

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.340
those grilled Lamb Skewers.

00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:38.980
Three big bunches for only ten qian.

00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:40.500

00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:46.180
But one thing puzzles me.

00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:48.300
Lamb is so expensive.

00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:50.660
Look, my salary isn't high,

00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:51.740
and my rank is insufficient.

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:53.200
Every year,
when salaries are distributed,

00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:54.740
I don't get a single lamb.

00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:56.860
How can the Shen family's lamb

00:14:57.140 --> 00:14:59.580
be sold so cheaply?

00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:01.580
I really can't figure it out.

00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:04.460
Want to copy?

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:05.300
Fine,

00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:06.820

Vice Prefect, please lend us
one more thing.

What?

00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:12.420
If I guess correctly,

00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:13.410
when you took office,

00:15:13.410 --> 00:15:15.620
the court's supplies
should have included lamb, right?

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:19.700
Brother Anran, how many lambs
do you get a year?

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:22.100
Enough to eat.

00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:23.300
That means

00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:24.340
at least

00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:25.580
four or five lambs, right?

- Don't rush, everyone gets some.
- Be careful, it's hot.

00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:01.260
Line up.

00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:02.740
Don't crowd.

00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:03.940
Dad!

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:05.100
Disperse.

00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:06.500
Disperse!

00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:07.740
Disperse now!

00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:09.140
Disperse, go away!

00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:11.900
Go away.

00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:14.660
Make way!

00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:17.500
Seems like something happened.

00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:18.980
Let us watch first.

00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:20.820
Our Yunlai guests

00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:22.500
are all of noble status.

00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:24.220
Dining at our place

00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:25.820
emphasizes tranquility.

00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:28.380
Look at your stalls,

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:29.780
so noisy that our guests

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:30.850
can't eat.

00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:31.980
What a disgrace!

00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:33.860
Move away!

00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:34.780
No!

00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:35.820
Don't touch!

00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:37.140
No, what is this?

00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:37.990
No!

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.000
Who told you to move?

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:40.260
- Don't touch!
- Yangyang!

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:41.660
- Yangyang!
- Move away!

00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:42.600
Don't touch my daughter!

00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:44.340
- Yangyang!
- Painful.

00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:45.300
Put it down!

00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:46.430
You... what are you doing?

00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:47.580
See who dares to touch our family?

00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:49.780
See who dares!

00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:50.940
- Are you okay?
- Who dares?

00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:52.340
- It's fine.
- What?

00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:53.180
Be careful, you!

00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:54.660
Drew a knife!

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:56.220
Yangyang, are you okay?

00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:58.180
I don't even dare to touch my wife.

00:16:58.180 --> 00:16:59.220
Who of you dares?

00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:00.380
Want to die?

00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:01.620
Sir,

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:03.620
which article in the market regulations

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:05.320
says you can't set up stalls
outside Yunlai Tavern?

00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:06.380
What?

00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:07.820
You refuse to move?

00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:09.420
Anyone can see

00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:11.260
we have not obstructed any shop.

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:12.660
If you forcibly dismantle our stall,

00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:14.260
we will have to inform the guards.

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:16.540
Lady,

00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:18.140
daring to call the guards

00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:19.740
on our turf?

00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:21.060
Have you considered

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:22.580
how the guards

00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:24.340
will judge you?

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:27.420
Hope that at that time,

00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:29.740
in the prison cell, you can still be

00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:31.260
as sharp-tongued

00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:32.980
as today.

00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:34.260
Prison?

00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:36.420
How did it come to prison?

00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:38.980
Among merchants in Juxian Alley,

00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:40.420
there are such heroes

00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:42.820
who can sentence people to prison
with one word?

00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:46.740
Where did this wild dog
come from, barking?

00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:48.900
Our Yunlai Tavern has been too long

00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:50.830
without showing authority
in Juxian Alley, right?

00:17:50.830 --> 00:17:52.460
Anyone dares to meddle in our affairs?

00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:53.980
Who?

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:55.180
Let me see.

00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:56.020
Who...?

00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:57.150
Lin...

00:17:57.150 --> 00:17:58.540
- Who?
- The newly appointed Vice Prefect.

00:17:58.540 --> 00:17:59.660
Vice Prefect... Lin.

00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:03.100
Look clearly now.

00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:05.900
Who dares to meddle in your affairs?

00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:07.820
Vice Prefect... Lin,

00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:09.780
I failed to recognize you.

00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:11.420
Kneel!

00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:13.020
How dare you?

00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:14.900
Not me.

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:17.780
How dare you?

00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:19.420
Daring to address the Vice Prefect

00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:20.580
as... wild dog.

00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:22.180
You're seeking death!

00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:24.700
Vice Prefect,

00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:25.620
earlier,

00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:26.940
it was my subordinate.

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:28.560
He spoke recklessly
with ignorance of propriety.

00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:30.100
I have already disciplined him.

00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:32.500
Not me.

00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:33.440
It's a misunderstanding.

00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:34.380
Today,

00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:37.660
this Shen family stall

00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:39.420
blocked the market square

00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:41.220
and severely obstructed

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:42.740
our Juxian Alley's

00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:44.020
restaurant operations.

00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:46.340
I kindly approached them
to dissuade them.

00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:48.660
Who knew the Shen family

00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:49.780
would be so obstinate?

00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:51.980
They even insulted us.

00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:52.820
You're spewing venom!

00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:53.980
- Vice Prefect.
- Nonsense!

00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:54.820
It's...

00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:56.660
Truly.

00:18:56.820 --> 00:18:58.380
You misjudge one point.

00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:01.500
I didn't just arrive.

00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:04.020
I have been watching

00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:06.380
since you first brought your men.

00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:10.940
Thanks, Manager Feng.

00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:14.660
Censor Pei,

00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:16.990
I have only recently arrived
at the Capital Prefecture.

00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:19.660
My duty is to inspect areas
and purge misconduct.

00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:20.500
Today,

00:19:20.850 --> 00:19:22.220
thanks to Manager Feng's

00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:24.820
consideration for my official burdens,

00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:26.500
he specially came to bully the weak

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:27.460
to gift me

00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:28.980
another merit to record.

00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:30.100
Vice Prefect Lin,

00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:31.500
I shall certainly
note this down for you.

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:32.780
You punish the strong, aid the weak,

00:19:33.030 --> 00:19:34.180
and eliminate evil root and branch.

00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:35.710
Thank you, Censor Pei.

00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:38.540
Misunderstanding!

00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:42.140
A colossal misunderstanding!

00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:44.060
What I said earlier

00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:45.420
was all in jest.

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:48.020
In truth, I saw the Shen family

00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:50.060
toil at their stall.

00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:52.780
So I brought some helpers,

00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:54.740
thinking they needed aid

00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:55.980
and lacked manpower.

00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:57.720
Why are you still kneeling?

00:19:57.740 --> 00:19:58.600
Help them!

00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:00.060
- Quick! Get up and help!
- Yes.

00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:00.930
- Hurry!
- Thank you.

00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:02.820
Thank you, Vice Prefect.

00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:05.620
- Thanks.
- What are you doing?

00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:07.140
Remove your hand!

00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:09.060
Who... who said you could touch?

00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:11.940
I'll help, too.

00:20:15.250 --> 00:20:16.380
Crush the strong, rescue the weak,

00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:17.500
and uphold justice through speech.

00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:18.700
Brother Anran,

00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:20.820
you're truly a model for our generation.

00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:22.300
Boss, another skewer for me!

00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:30.020
This Shen stall is too crowded.

00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:32.780
Shall we switch to another?

00:20:33.550 --> 00:20:35.140
- I'll follow...
- Boss! Another skewer!

00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:36.660
you, Twelfth Master.

00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:38.700
After you.

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:41.660
Wait!

00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:42.980
Wait for me!

00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:44.820
Wait! Future son-in-law!

00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:45.780
Auntie,

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:47.820
future...?

00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:48.820
Future son-in-law.

00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:53.820
Apologies, Vice Prefect.

00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:55.340
I ran too hastily.

00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:57.020
My mind went blank for a moment.

00:20:57.020 --> 00:20:58.100
I misspoke.

00:20:58.100 --> 00:20:59.050
I'm sorry, Vice Prefect.

00:20:59.050 --> 00:20:59.900
Apologies.

00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:00.740
Don't rush.

00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:02.540
Thank you for helping us earlier.

00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:03.820
These are made by Jicai...

00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:04.800
No...

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:05.750
These are fresh Lamb Skewers

00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:06.660
made by Shaoguang.

00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:08.100
Take them while hot.

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:09.090
Auntie, this is inappropriate.

00:21:09.090 --> 00:21:10.100
Quick. Vice Prefect, take them.

00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:11.360
- Take them, Vice Prefect.
- No need.

00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:14.620
Oh, you have a friend present.

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:17.140
Then... I shall not disturb.

00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:19.940
But Vice Prefect,

00:21:20.290 --> 00:21:21.320
without you,

00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:22.620
our family business would fail.

00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:23.660
We must give you

00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:24.860
your share of the profits.

00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:25.940
I asked the mutton sellers

00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:26.820
about the market price

00:21:26.850 --> 00:21:28.660
and added an extra ten percent.
It's not much.

00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:29.670
Vice Prefect, don't disdain it.

00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:30.560
- Take it.
- Auntie...

00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:31.400
No, Vice Prefect.

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:32.990
- Auntie, this is inappropriate.
- Just take it.

00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:34.070
We agreed. Quick. Accept it.

00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:34.890
Eat while hot.

00:21:34.890 --> 00:21:35.700
Eat while hot!

00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:37.820
Liu Chang, return it!

00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:42.780
Son-in-law?

00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:44.700
What son-in-law?

00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:46.500
Twelfth Master, you misheard.

00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:50.700
Since childhood,

00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:52.660
my ears

00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:54.940
could hear any sound within three zhang.

00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:56.260
Back in the countryside,

00:21:56.780 --> 00:21:58.740
all rumors from the villages around

00:21:58.740 --> 00:21:59.820
reached my ears.

00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:01.700
I could not possibly mishear.

00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:04.620
She called you "son-in-law".

00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:12.060
I'm acquainted with the Shen family.

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:14.950
Our parents arranged a betrothal
between me and Lady Shen.

00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:16.020
Please

00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:17.820
keep this secret.

00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:19.740
An arranged marriage?

00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:24.220
But the Shen family is merchants.

00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:25.540
If you marry into

00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:27.140
such a family,

00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:27.980
and if word spreads,

00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:30.020
it will harm your career.

00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:32.860
Rest assured. I will not spread it.

00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:35.700
This is nothing.

00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:36.740
Nothing?

00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:38.620
How can this be nothing?

00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:40.180
Marrying them

00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:41.460
will burden your descendants.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.340
A womb betrothal means no formal
betrothal gifts were exchanged, right?

00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:46.340
It can't hold.

00:22:46.810 --> 00:22:47.860
Stay vigilant.

00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:49.140
Don't let this family

00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:50.740
ensnare you.

00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:52.060
Twelfth Master,

00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:53.340
they are not such people.

00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:55.140
And please don't jump to conclusions.

00:22:56.820 --> 00:22:58.140
You...

00:22:58.140 --> 00:22:59.380
They use

00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:01.300
such food to coax you.

00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:06.060
This smells rather fragrant.

00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:08.300
Let me taste it.

00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:12.340
I have considerable expertise

00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:13.820
in appraising fine cuisine.

00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:16.420
Rustic fare of country bumpkins

00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:17.840
won't satisfy me.

00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:44.420
(Juxian Alley)

00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:52.500
Delicious.

00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:53.580
Truly delicious.

00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:55.820
Simply a peerless delicacy
of the mortal realm.

00:23:58.340 --> 00:23:59.340
Compared to this,

00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:02.580
all the exquisite dishes
I've savored before

00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:04.700
are utterly worthless.

00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:08.540
Never imagined

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:10.140
this Lady Shen

00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:11.660
could create

00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:13.820
such exquisite flavor.

00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:16.700
This woman is truly rare in this world.

00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:18.580
So rare.

00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:21.180
Actually, merchant families

00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:23.420
aren't so bad, are they?

00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:26.020
Brother Anran,

00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:28.220
I suddenly feel

00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:30.660
that if you marry Lady Shen...

00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:33.060
I should send her away early.

00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:35.220
What?

00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:37.780
Nothing.

00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:41.580
Here, all for you.

00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:42.520
All these are for you to eat.

00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:43.780
Here.

00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:44.980
Anran!

00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:46.820
I'm treating you to a meal.

00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:48.460
This... this will not do.

00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:57.020
(Start Near to Go Far)

00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:02.420
I have never seen

00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:04.300
so much money.

00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:05.980
Let me touch it, too.

00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:11.100
See how great Yong'an is.

00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:13.180
Just casually selling these Lamb Skewers

00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:14.900
earned so much.

00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:17.460
Ancient folks have taste.

00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:19.580
They know how to appreciate my cooking.

00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:22.620
It makes me not want to go back.

00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:24.700
Shen Jianshe,

00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:26.900
you're exploiting the information gap
of a modern person

00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:28.600
and making things that
these people haven't eaten.

00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:30.400
If you were truly capable,

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:31.620
our little restaurant back home

00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:33.300
wouldn't have gone bankrupt under you.

00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:37.740
I'm the one

00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:38.600
who... skewer by skewer...

00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:40.420
What did you say?

00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:41.820
Louder.

00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:43.260
I said...

00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:46.020
I said... you... you were right.

00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:50.260
Ancient money is easy to earn,

00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:51.820
but nowhere to spend it.

00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:53.400
No wireless internet.

00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:54.290
Can't surf the web.

00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:55.270
Can't binge on TV dramas.

00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:56.980
No chili peppers. No air conditioning.

00:25:57.140 --> 00:25:58.580
Fetch water yourself.

00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:00.340
Empty the toilet yourself.

00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:02.860
Yes! Tell me, this dump...

00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:05.140
Games? Can't play games.

00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:06.380
TV dramas? Can't watch dramas.

00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:07.820
I say... we should

00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:10.620
take the gold back to modern times

00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:12.740
and live in comfort.
That's the real deal!

00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:13.580
Right?

00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:15.700
Brother, when are you not
living in comfort?

00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:17.740
- How could you...?
- Your sister is right.

00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:19.540
You really should learn from me.

00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:21.020
I truly excel in the hall

00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:21.980
and master the kitchen.

00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:23.940
Handsome looks, perfect physique.

00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:25.620
The very image
of the head of a household.

00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:29.180
How much have you earned?

00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:31.180
And you've already forgotten
your own surname and nature?

00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:32.340
It's Shen.

00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:37.020
Actually, I like ancient times, too.

00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:38.100
We earn

00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:40.180
this huge bucket of money so easily.

00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:41.260
Plus,

00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:42.200
I don't have to go to school,

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:43.220
study,

00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:44.060
or do homework.

00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:45.940
Listen,

00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:46.980
if we go back,

00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:48.380
you'll have to make up
all that homework.

00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:49.220
Understand?

00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:50.060
Don't learn from your dad.

00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:52.100
I... When I was little,

00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:53.280
I always submitted homework on time.

00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:56.380
Let's keep striving.

00:26:56.380 --> 00:26:57.820
While we can still earn,

00:26:57.820 --> 00:26:59.340
we must earn more.

00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:00.340
Then, after returning,

00:27:00.340 --> 00:27:01.660
life will be better, too.

00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:02.500
Wait. Mom,

00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:04.860
I skewer Lamb Skewers every night.

00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:05.820
My hands are sparking.

00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:07.620
Look at my hands. Reeking of mutton.

00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:08.620
I skewered, too.

00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:09.660
I also grilled.

00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:12.380
Lamb Skewers take time.
Cut meat, marinate,

00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:13.780
then skewer one by one.

00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:15.340
It's truly time-consuming and laborious.

00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:16.740
If we want to earn more,

00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:18.660
we need to sell things
that can be mass-produced

00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:19.860
with high unit prices.

00:27:20.770 --> 00:27:21.660
This...

00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:22.500
What?

00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:26.380
These days, some guests

00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:27.940
said eating too many meat skewers
chokes them.

00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:28.860
Could we

00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:30.420
make drinks to sell alongside?

00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:34.300
Makes sense!

So fragrant.

- Your Lamb Skewers.
- Thank you.

00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:06.420

00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:07.700
no slacking today.

We can only rely on you.

00:28:10.780 --> 00:28:12.700
Got it. Am I that unreliable?

00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:18.180
What a profound misunderstanding.

00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:21.580
Okay.

00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:22.700
Everyone!

00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:24.460

00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:26.220
ever been betrayed?

the feeling of beating

and let it all out.

00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:38.630
Don't really think about

00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:40.060
your ex-wife who ran off.

00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:44.220
Apologies, everyone.

00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:45.220
Behold.

00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:51.380
Such a refreshing aroma.

00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:55.300
First shake: past troubles
scatter like smoke.

00:29:56.180 --> 00:29:58.660
Second shake: bright future
comes into view.

00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:01.820
Third shake: wealth and peace
forevermore!

00:30:02.060 --> 00:30:03.740
Good!

00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:05.940
Here. Open good fortune.

00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:07.820
Open good fortune!

00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:13.620
So fresh!

00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:15.660
What taste must this be?

00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:17.900
And ice cubes.

00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:19.660
Real ice cubes!

00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:22.780
How wonderful for summer heat!

00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:23.820
Everyone,

00:30:24.020 --> 00:30:24.860
I shall taste it

00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:26.180
for you all.

00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:33.740
How is it?

00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:34.900
I have never

00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:38.020
drunk such a delicious drink in my life.

00:30:38.180 --> 00:30:40.180
Truly exquisite!

00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:41.850
Exquisite!

00:30:41.860 --> 00:30:42.740
- Good!
- Good!

00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:43.820
I want some Lamb Skewers.

00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:44.700
I also want this!

00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:46.460
- Okay. One Green Drink.
- No problem.

00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:48.060
Other drinks look good, too.

00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:49.140
Give me this one.

00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:50.540
- I want this one.
- This one!

00:30:50.540 --> 00:30:51.660
Alright. You'll all have it.

00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:53.020
One by one!

00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:54.980
Line up! Here they are!

00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:06.180
The last two times, I said

00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:07.380
I'd treat you to a meal.

00:31:07.380 --> 00:31:08.700
We didn't get to finish properly.

00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:10.100
Now... this time,

00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:11.500
it's you treating us again.

00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:13.020
I'm truly embarrassed.

00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:15.180
What is this?

00:31:15.930 --> 00:31:17.980
This is a special tea drink
made by the Shen family.

00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:20.020
It's called Dark Plum...

00:31:24.940 --> 00:31:26.300
Dark Plum...

00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:29.180
Liu Chang.

00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:31.980
This tea is called Dark Plum Bobo,

00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:33.540
All Things As You Wish.

00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:34.380
Exactly.

00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:36.460
Dark Plum Bobo, All Things As You Wish.

00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:38.700
All Things As You Wish.

00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:39.540
Good name.

00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:41.260
Why can't I say it out loud?

00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:45.980
It's delicious.

00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:47.860
Lady Shen came up with this name, right?

00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:50.660
She really has a clever mind.

00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:52.120
Brother Anran, you are truly blessed.

00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:55.340
I heard

00:31:56.500 --> 00:31:58.580
that you recently wanted
an advance on your salary.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:31:59.920
Has something happened?

00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:03.180
That Vice Minister Zhang

00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:05.740
just pushed my request back. But he...

00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:07.460
But he talked about this matter.

00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:08.900
This person, honestly...

00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:10.380
If you're facing difficulties,

00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:11.860
you should tell me.

00:32:12.140 --> 00:32:13.140
It's nothing.

00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:14.700
I consider you a friend.

00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:16.100
Between friends,
when there's difficulty,

00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:17.420
why hide it?

00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:21.820
Actually, it's...

00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:23.570
it's Princess Fuhui,

00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:24.820
who's hosting a Qixi Poetry Gathering.

00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:26.740
She sent the invitation
to the Censorate.

00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:28.220
A poetry gathering?

00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:30.940
What's so difficult about that?

00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:32.860
A normal banquet

00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:33.980
wouldn't really be a problem.

00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:36.620
But her Qixi Poetry Gathering

00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:38.620
is considered
Yong'an's premier social event.

00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:40.980
I genuinely want to go
and see the spectacle.

00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:42.980
But...

00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:46.300
I... I don't have
a decent set of clothes.

00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:48.940
So I wanted to get some silk on credit.

00:32:49.230 --> 00:32:50.820
Unfortunately,
Vice Minister Zhang didn't agree.

00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:52.500
Then I just don't go.

00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:53.710
Is that all?

00:32:55.180 --> 00:32:56.220
I can make

00:32:56.220 --> 00:32:57.540
a suit of clothes for you.

00:32:57.870 --> 00:32:58.740
Really?

00:32:58.740 --> 00:32:59.580
Really.

00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:02.140
Forget it.

00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:03.220
No need.

00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:05.580
The Capital Prefecture's affairs
are complicated and burdensome.

00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:06.780
Your salaries

00:33:06.780 --> 00:33:07.740
are hard-earned.

00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:09.020
Forget it.

00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:10.780
Then...

00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:13.540
then wouldn't it be better

00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:16.460
if you lent me a set?

00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:18.900
Sure. Take your pick.

00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:20.460
Thank you, Brother Anran.

00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:21.780
Look,

00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:23.180
I haven't managed
to treat you to a meal.

00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:25.320
And now I'm borrowing
a suit of clothes from you.

00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:29.700
Brother Anran,
are you attending it, too?

00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:33.220
You also know

00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:35.100
that the Capital Prefecture is a mess.

00:33:35.540 --> 00:33:36.900
Over the years, relations with her

00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:37.740
have been neglected.

00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:39.290
And I've only just taken up my post.

00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:40.940
How could I ask for an invitation?

00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:42.500
How can that be!

00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:43.900
Brother Anran, rest assured.

00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:46.140
Getting an invitation is easy for us.

00:33:46.140 --> 00:33:47.180
I'll take care of this.

00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:50.960
The Grand Princess
finds her previous chef

00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:51.840
lacking in novelty.

00:33:51.850 --> 00:33:53.090
She's currently searching everywhere

00:33:53.090 --> 00:33:55.750
for an innovative, excellent chef
to cater for the poetry gathering.

00:33:58.100 --> 00:33:59.740
An innovative, excellent chef...

00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:01.180
Well, you have

00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:02.900
a suitable candidate right here.

00:34:12.220 --> 00:34:13.300
- Apologies for the wait.
- Sir!

00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:14.790
- They're free for you.
- How about two more?

00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:17.860
Apologies, everyone, truly,
we have nothing left.

00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:19.620
How about this,
everyone, please come early tomorrow?

00:34:19.620 --> 00:34:20.560
The evening drum has sounded.

00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:21.700
It's time for us to pack up.

00:34:21.700 --> 00:34:22.760
Please come back tomorrow.

00:34:22.940 --> 00:34:24.300
Sorry.

00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:25.740
Could we have one more cup?

00:34:25.740 --> 00:34:27.020
Let's go.

00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:30.660
Business was incredibly good today.

00:34:30.660 --> 00:34:31.940
I really didn't expect that.

00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:33.490
- The first day! Business is so good.
- Auntie,

00:34:33.490 --> 00:34:34.450
the money box is almost full.

00:34:35.460 --> 00:34:36.300
So amazing.

00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:37.140
Good girl, Yangyang.

00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:41.380
So Big a Bucket!
Finish Homework,

00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:43.220
Top Exams Crimson!

00:34:43.580 --> 00:34:45.260
Find an Ideal Husband.

00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:46.900
Ultracute Maiden Purple!

00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:48.540
Beat Unfaithful Men. Green Drink!

00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:51.380
Dark Plum Bobo, All Things As You Wish.

00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:53.380
Yangyang, let me tell you.

00:34:53.660 --> 00:34:54.480
The flaw in her character

00:34:54.500 --> 00:34:55.980
is right here.

00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:57.760
She just wants to hear ancient people

00:34:57.760 --> 00:34:58.860
say these phrases out loud.

00:34:59.020 --> 00:35:00.490
This is simply the collapse of ritual.

00:35:00.820 --> 00:35:01.700
Dad,

00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:02.940
you know an idiom.

00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:05.420
What does that mean?

00:35:06.460 --> 00:35:07.940
How come I don't know how to use it?

00:35:08.620 --> 00:35:10.460
It's just a collapse.

00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:11.300
Collapse?

00:35:11.980 --> 00:35:13.700
This tea drink looks novel.

00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:14.900
Could you prepare a few barrels

00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:16.290
and deliver them
to the military tomorrow?

00:35:17.060 --> 00:35:17.900
General!

00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:20.660
No problem. Later, we...

00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:22.080
If it's for delivery
to the military camp,

00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:23.100
forgive me, I dare not comply.

00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:24.380
You...

00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:25.700
Why?

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:27.480
General, when you say "military camp",

00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:28.860
you mean the Imperial Guard, right?

00:35:29.170 --> 00:35:31.390
The Imperial Guard protects His Majesty
with great responsibility.

00:35:31.390 --> 00:35:33.100
Food procurement has strict regulations.

00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:34.180
How dare we, ordinary people,

00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:35.900
send tea drinks to the military camp?

00:35:36.340 --> 00:35:37.900
It's only tea.

00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:39.100
You still dare not send it.

00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:42.540
After all, a young woman is in charge,

00:35:42.860 --> 00:35:43.900
and you lack courage.

00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:45.340
General,

00:35:45.980 --> 00:35:47.460
whether this tea is brewed in our pot

00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:48.660
or in the camp's pot,

00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:49.540
isn't it the same?

00:35:49.540 --> 00:35:51.220
Then why not have
the official camp cooks brew it?

00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:52.660
You wish

00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:54.220
to sell me the recipe?

00:35:54.340 --> 00:35:55.820
We won't be staying in Yong'an long.

00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:57.740
There's no need
to keep the recipe secret.

00:35:58.180 --> 00:35:59.080
We don't sell the tea drink

00:35:59.150 --> 00:36:00.940
because we worry
we couldn't bear the responsibility.

00:36:01.090 --> 00:36:02.230
But I'm willing to sell the recipe.

00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:03.740
The Imperial Guard defends peace.

00:36:03.740 --> 00:36:04.780
You deserve to taste

00:36:04.780 --> 00:36:06.260
Yong'an's newest and best tea.

00:36:08.950 --> 00:36:11.100
Just now, I said the young lady
lacked courage.

00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:13.340
It seems I misjudged.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:14.940
You flatter me, General.

00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:16.220
Please wait a moment.

00:36:16.820 --> 00:36:17.900
General, wait just a moment.

00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:18.740
Auntie!

00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:21.420
Bold in thought and action.

00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:23.100
If she stayed in Yong'an,

00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:24.580
she could become a great merchant

00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:25.780
in no time.

00:36:27.220 --> 00:36:28.700
Young Master, actually...

00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:30.980
you admire Lady Shen quite a bit.

00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:33.780
Nonsense.

00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:36.100
General, here's the recipe.

00:36:38.820 --> 00:36:39.660
Thank you.

00:36:40.940 --> 00:36:41.780
Let's go.

00:36:43.060 --> 00:36:44.020
Look. Look.

00:36:46.020 --> 00:36:47.260
We've struck it rich!

00:36:48.860 --> 00:36:49.740
Don't flaunt wealth.

00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:51.100
It's fine, there's so much.

00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:53.180
What are you afraid of?

00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:55.340
Auntie, the Vice Prefect has arrived.

00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:58.380
- Vice Prefect.
- Vice Prefect. Mr. Liu.

00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:01.980
Any drinks left? Get them something.

00:37:02.180 --> 00:37:03.020
No need.

00:37:03.220 --> 00:37:05.180
I came to discuss a matter
with Lady Shen.

00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:06.020
Alright.

00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:09.940
There are still two cups here.
Find an Ideal Husband.

00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:11.100
Ultracute Maiden Purple!

00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:12.740
Please try it.

00:37:12.740 --> 00:37:14.020
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:14.940
Good. Alright.

00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:15.860
You chat.

00:37:15.860 --> 00:37:16.700
Yangyang, come here.

00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:29.300
Is this cup of "Ultracute Maiden Purple!

00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:30.420
Find an Ideal Husband"

00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:32.020
tasty?

00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:33.660
Tasty.

00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:36.900
Isn't it called "Find an Ideal Husband.

00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:38.260
Ultracute Maiden Purple"?

00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:39.460
Did you change the name?

00:37:42.820 --> 00:37:44.020
Didn't change it.

00:37:44.260 --> 00:37:45.320
Vice Prefect, you said it right.

00:37:48.380 --> 00:37:49.380
You did it on purpose.

00:37:49.700 --> 00:37:51.180
My elder brother said this name

00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:52.260
is too "collapse of ritual".

00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:54.260
I didn't think so before.

00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:56.340
When you said it, I realized.

00:37:59.020 --> 00:38:00.340
Stop laughing, Jicai.

00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:15.060
So teasing others is quite fun.

00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:21.180
Vice Prefect, what matter
did you come to discuss?

00:38:24.020 --> 00:38:25.540
Princess Fuhui is seeking someone

00:38:25.540 --> 00:38:27.250
to cater this year's
Qixi Poetry Gathering.

00:38:28.060 --> 00:38:30.220
I asked a friend at the Censorate
to put in a good word for you.

00:38:30.220 --> 00:38:31.060
Would you be willing

00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:32.540
to give it a try?

00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:33.380
What?

00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:35.820
Have us cater her Qixi Poetry Gathering?

00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:48.460
