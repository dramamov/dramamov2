WEBVTT

00:00:12.583 --> 00:00:14.208
You almost escaped.

00:00:15.291 --> 00:00:16.416
You were so close.

00:00:17.541 --> 00:00:20.375
But you're doing so well here,
so I'll give you a chance.

00:00:22.416 --> 00:00:23.958
Look at your two friends.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:25.916
One of them snitched on you.

00:00:26.833 --> 00:00:27.916
Guess who.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.416
Guess.
If you're right, I'll let you kill her.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.000
A life for a life, okay?

00:00:41.583 --> 00:00:42.666
I don't want to.

00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:46.541
I was just kidding.

00:00:46.625 --> 00:00:47.791
We don't kill people.

00:00:47.875 --> 00:00:49.916
We don't just kill people here,
do we?

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.416
Okay, just stab her.

00:00:52.666 --> 00:00:53.916
Go on, stab her.

00:00:59.666 --> 00:01:00.750
Here.

00:01:00.833 --> 00:01:02.458
One cut and you can go.

00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:07.333
Hurry up. Who will do it?

00:01:07.416 --> 00:01:08.833
- Hurry up.
- Quick.

00:01:09.458 --> 00:01:11.208
One cut won't kill her.

00:01:11.791 --> 00:01:12.625
Don't be scared.

00:01:13.416 --> 00:01:14.458
No.

00:01:16.791 --> 00:01:19.166
Fuck, what's up today? I'll do it.

00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:21.083
Are you done?

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.916
Let's just say I snitched.

00:01:25.708 --> 00:01:26.583
Okay?

00:01:27.125 --> 00:01:28.625
Otherwise, someone will die.

00:01:55.916 --> 00:01:57.125
Come in.

00:02:17.416 --> 00:02:18.250
Kai.

00:02:20.041 --> 00:02:22.208
Can you let Hsin-yi go?

00:02:42.458 --> 00:02:43.375
Turn over.

00:02:59.458 --> 00:03:01.416
Are you withdrawing everything?

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:02.333
Yes.

00:03:02.875 --> 00:03:03.791
Sign here.

00:03:04.875 --> 00:03:06.541
If you want to close the account,

00:03:06.625 --> 00:03:09.583
you must pay the annual fee of 1,800.

00:03:09.666 --> 00:03:10.833
Give her 1,800.

00:03:11.416 --> 00:03:13.041
Can I get the money now?

00:03:13.125 --> 00:03:14.625
It's quite a large amount,

00:03:14.708 --> 00:03:18.291
so you'll have to collect it
from the VIP counter.

00:03:19.416 --> 00:03:20.833
I'll take you there.

00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:23.250
Look after this customer.

00:03:23.333 --> 00:03:24.500
Who has 200 in cash?

00:03:25.666 --> 00:03:27.041
Get their basic information.

00:03:27.375 --> 00:03:28.833
I do. I've got it.

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:54.083
Here.

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.500
What's the problem?

00:04:17.291 --> 00:04:19.458
- How's it going?
- Should be done soon.

00:04:31.041 --> 00:04:32.666
You can collect your money now.

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:33.583
Okay.

00:04:46.416 --> 00:04:48.250
Kai, we're done.

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:50.416
Let's go.

00:05:31.541 --> 00:05:32.375
Hsin-yi.

00:05:38.833 --> 00:05:39.875
Come on.

00:05:42.166 --> 00:05:43.041
Have some water.

00:06:03.166 --> 00:06:04.166
Sorry.

00:06:07.041 --> 00:06:08.208
I'm sorry.

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:24.083
Wait for me.

00:07:18.166 --> 00:07:19.000
Hsin-yi.

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:22.375
Hsin-yi.

00:07:22.458 --> 00:07:24.041
We can go home now.

00:07:26.083 --> 00:07:26.916
Hsin-yi.

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:28.583
Let's go.

00:07:33.458 --> 00:07:34.416
Hsin-yi.

00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:36.916
Hsin-yi.

00:07:40.291 --> 00:07:41.208
Hsin-yi.

00:07:50.791 --> 00:07:51.791
Hsin-yi.

00:07:54.416 --> 00:07:55.250
Hsin-yi.

00:08:45.666 --> 00:08:47.708
- Hey.
- Go, go! Go already.

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:50.416
Quick!

00:09:13.625 --> 00:09:15.166
Kai, there's no time.

00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:17.541
Let's go. There's no time. Come on!

00:09:18.583 --> 00:09:19.416
Now!

00:09:56.583 --> 00:10:00.708
09 JUDGEMENT NIGHT

00:10:08.166 --> 00:10:09.166
Take a sip.

00:10:18.291 --> 00:10:22.000
I had planned
to kill Chang Shih-kai today.

00:10:23.416 --> 00:10:25.041
But I failed.

00:10:26.625 --> 00:10:27.708
It's been five years.

00:10:28.708 --> 00:10:31.208
I still can't be as brave as Hsin-yi.

00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:35.125
I just don't understand
why Hsin-yi had to die.

00:10:35.916 --> 00:10:37.583
Why'd Chang Shih-kai get to live?

00:10:37.666 --> 00:10:39.625
How come he still gets to threaten me?

00:10:39.708 --> 00:10:41.208
- Why--
- How'd he threaten you?

00:10:51.416 --> 00:10:52.500
Hello?

00:10:52.583 --> 00:10:54.166
Eason may die.

00:10:55.416 --> 00:10:56.250
What?

00:10:56.333 --> 00:10:59.375
Wallet. They took the wallet.
What should we do?

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:02.916
Maybe you should leave.
It's too dangerous.

00:11:07.291 --> 00:11:08.541
I'll call you later.

00:11:18.458 --> 00:11:19.958
I'm done with his threats.

00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:24.125
Chang Shih-kai said he'd tell everyone

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:26.875
that I pushed Jin Jin off the building.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.083
I didn't mean it.

00:11:29.791 --> 00:11:30.875
It was because

00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:32.000
Chang Shih-kai said

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.750
that the day we tried to escape,

00:11:35.916 --> 00:11:37.000
we only got caught

00:11:37.583 --> 00:11:38.833
because someone told him.

00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:42.208
I always thought it was Jin Jin.

00:11:42.875 --> 00:11:44.541
That night the police came,

00:11:44.625 --> 00:11:46.791
we were arguing about it.

00:11:48.458 --> 00:11:49.500
Jin Jin!

00:11:50.083 --> 00:11:51.500
Jin Jin, where're you going?

00:11:51.583 --> 00:11:53.666
Hsin-yi's still in a cage. She needs us.

00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:55.083
Don't touch me.

00:11:55.166 --> 00:11:57.583
I don't know what'd gotten into her.
I was so mad

00:11:57.666 --> 00:11:59.541
because she wouldn't admit it.

00:11:59.625 --> 00:12:01.625
Are you going to betray us again?

00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:04.291
It was you who told him

00:12:04.375 --> 00:12:06.375
about Hsin-yi's escape plan, wasn't it?

00:12:06.458 --> 00:12:08.291
You're a murderer just like him.

00:12:11.125 --> 00:12:12.750
If I'm a murderer, what are you?

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.500
Chang Shih-kai's sex slave?

00:12:16.333 --> 00:12:17.208
Then I…

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.041
But I only just found out

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.833
that Jin Jin got Hsin-yi to go there

00:12:30.458 --> 00:12:32.125
so she could save me.

00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:37.708
Why did I believe
Chang Shih-kai back then?

00:12:38.333 --> 00:12:40.333
They were my closest friends.

00:12:41.458 --> 00:12:43.208
But I never trusted Jin Jin.

00:12:48.916 --> 00:12:52.166
At least you alerted the police
and saved a lot of people.

00:12:54.875 --> 00:12:55.833
It wasn't me.

00:12:56.583 --> 00:12:57.583
It was Jin Jin.

00:12:58.708 --> 00:13:01.208
My mom said the banknote had gotten lost

00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:03.375
and Jin Jin was in a coma,

00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:06.333
so she forced me to play the hero.

00:13:07.583 --> 00:13:09.291
Can I still say it was me?

00:14:15.375 --> 00:14:19.791
CHAO CHING

00:14:44.833 --> 00:14:47.333
The Tai Chi Association got the wallet.

00:15:03.291 --> 00:15:05.416
I'll still keep my promise.

00:15:08.291 --> 00:15:09.583
I don't know why.

00:15:11.666 --> 00:15:13.583
I should hate you more than anyone.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.833
But when I see you now,

00:15:20.416 --> 00:15:21.833
I don't feel a thing.

00:15:39.458 --> 00:15:41.416
You hate Chao Ching right now.

00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:45.250
You never wanted revenge.

00:15:46.916 --> 00:15:48.416
You just wanted to help her

00:15:50.416 --> 00:15:51.833
because you cared about her.

00:15:55.166 --> 00:15:56.250
I'll be honest.

00:16:00.916 --> 00:16:03.125
I could accept the death penalty.

00:16:04.750 --> 00:16:07.333
But I can't accept
Chao Ching's punishment.

00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:10.875
Who gave her the right to punish me?

00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:12.500
Who does she think she is?

00:16:13.833 --> 00:16:15.041
It's not her place.

00:16:15.666 --> 00:16:17.000
Then whose is it?

00:16:20.541 --> 00:16:21.625
God.

00:16:24.083 --> 00:16:27.666
God dictated I was born an orphan.

00:16:28.833 --> 00:16:31.208
He decided
that I'd have her for a mother.

00:16:32.875 --> 00:16:34.583
He saw everything I went through.

00:16:37.125 --> 00:16:39.375
Only he knows

00:16:39.458 --> 00:16:40.916
that anyone in that situation

00:16:41.916 --> 00:16:43.916
would do exactly the same thing.

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:50.416
No matter what Jin Jin and I did…

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.041
…Chao Ching has no right to judge us.

00:16:58.083 --> 00:17:00.250
If it had been Hsin-yi who hurt Jin Jin,

00:17:01.708 --> 00:17:03.958
I know you wouldn't hurt her.

00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:07.333
Because she's Chao Ching's daughter.

00:17:16.791 --> 00:17:18.166
Tonight,

00:17:18.833 --> 00:17:21.208
your mom will use that charity event

00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:24.208
to launder all the money
in the crypto wallet.

00:17:26.291 --> 00:17:27.375
I can help you.

00:17:37.541 --> 00:17:39.083
Hello, Hsu Yung from Super News.

00:17:40.083 --> 00:17:41.125
This is Chao Ching.

00:17:41.666 --> 00:17:43.000
I have a big scoop.

00:17:43.083 --> 00:17:44.041
Are you interested?

00:17:56.583 --> 00:17:58.083
This way please. This way.

00:18:00.625 --> 00:18:03.666
Welcome. Thank you for coming.

00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:04.833
Thank you.

00:18:04.916 --> 00:18:07.875
- So pretty.
- Thank you. Thank you.

00:18:08.791 --> 00:18:10.458
- Am I late?
- Not at all.

00:18:10.541 --> 00:18:12.708
Hello, Mr. Kuo.

00:18:12.791 --> 00:18:15.208
- Thank you.
- You've done a good job.

00:18:15.291 --> 00:18:16.416
It all looks so good.

00:18:17.166 --> 00:18:18.750
I knew you could get this done.

00:18:19.208 --> 00:18:20.625
You deserve this.

00:18:21.208 --> 00:18:23.000
Mr. Yuan, let me introduce Mr. Kuo.

00:18:23.083 --> 00:18:24.291
- Hello.
- Hi, Mr. Yuan.

00:19:23.208 --> 00:19:25.875
- Wow.
- We completely redecorated.

00:19:25.958 --> 00:19:28.041
That's where the pardoning takes place.

00:19:28.125 --> 00:19:30.041
You've created such a unique ambiance.

00:19:30.125 --> 00:19:31.541
We put a lot into this event.

00:19:31.625 --> 00:19:32.458
What's that?

00:19:32.541 --> 00:19:34.208
Sanching water. Have you tried it?

00:19:34.291 --> 00:19:36.291
Try some. It will protect you.

00:19:36.375 --> 00:19:37.416
To prosperity.

00:19:38.125 --> 00:19:40.541
- Drink up.
- Excellent. To health and prosperity.

00:20:41.083 --> 00:20:43.166
Hello, please try some.

00:20:43.250 --> 00:20:46.958
Welcome, Mr. and Mrs. Hsu.
Thank you for coming. Thank you.

00:20:47.666 --> 00:20:49.000
You look beautiful today.

00:20:49.083 --> 00:20:51.291
- Sir. Have some water.
- Let me introduce you.

00:20:51.375 --> 00:20:53.583
Mr. and Mrs. Yang,
this is Mr. and Mrs. Hsu.

00:20:53.666 --> 00:20:54.916
Thank you for coming.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.166
Sir, is there a problem?

00:20:56.250 --> 00:20:58.958
This water grants protection,
wellness, and prosperity.

00:21:35.791 --> 00:21:37.083
It's classy in here.

00:21:39.333 --> 00:21:40.250
Mr. Kuo.

00:21:40.333 --> 00:21:41.833
Wow, what a coincidence.

00:21:43.166 --> 00:21:44.208
What brings you here?

00:21:44.291 --> 00:21:45.666
They asked me to come

00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:47.708
and witness your act of generosity.

00:21:47.791 --> 00:21:48.625
I see.

00:21:48.708 --> 00:21:50.416
Mr. Kuo, I've got an idea.

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:53.000
Since you've become
a major player in the party,

00:21:53.083 --> 00:21:55.333
why don't you come on Super News?

00:21:55.416 --> 00:21:58.500
We had great ratings
last time you came on.

00:21:59.250 --> 00:22:00.250
I'm just messing.

00:22:00.333 --> 00:22:01.166
I know.

00:22:01.875 --> 00:22:02.708
Okay, see you.

00:22:02.791 --> 00:22:04.250
Thank you. Mr. Kuo.

00:22:04.333 --> 00:22:05.166
Yes?

00:22:05.791 --> 00:22:07.583
- Don't you need to go?
- No.

00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:09.875
I'm just kidding.

00:22:09.958 --> 00:22:11.000
Come. It's free now.

00:22:11.541 --> 00:22:12.875
- We'll chat later.
- Okay.

00:22:12.958 --> 00:22:14.500
Go ahead.

00:22:14.583 --> 00:22:16.250
It's always great seeing you.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.208
Just a minute.

00:22:30.875 --> 00:22:31.958
This is the men's.

00:22:32.041 --> 00:22:33.083
Ladies' is next door.

00:22:33.166 --> 00:22:34.625
Hello, Mr. Kuo.

00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:39.083
What's this?

00:22:39.583 --> 00:22:41.250
I'd like to do you a favor.

00:23:42.166 --> 00:23:45.625
We must practice self-reflection
and cultivate the three virtues:

00:23:45.708 --> 00:23:48.000
patience, perseverance,
and inner peace.

00:23:48.416 --> 00:23:51.708
We must learn to overcome adversity
and transcend our karma.

00:23:51.791 --> 00:23:53.291
Heavy karma often breeds

00:23:53.375 --> 00:23:54.750
greater delusions.

00:23:55.291 --> 00:23:57.916
We cultivate to transcend life and death.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.125
That is the Sanching way.
You are all Good Samaritans.

00:24:01.208 --> 00:24:03.208
You are all Good Samaritans.

00:24:03.291 --> 00:24:04.666
Where's Mr. Kuo?

00:24:04.750 --> 00:24:06.666
Get Ms. Chou.
Find out where Mr. Kuo is.

00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:07.583
Ms. Chou left.

00:24:07.666 --> 00:24:09.166
- She left?
- We must practice…

00:24:09.291 --> 00:24:11.666
She went to the hotel.
I called a car for her.

00:24:12.541 --> 00:24:13.583
- Find Mr. Kuo.
- Okay.

00:24:13.666 --> 00:24:16.583
We must learn to overcome adversity
and transcend our karma.

00:24:16.666 --> 00:24:18.125
Heavy karma often breeds

00:24:18.208 --> 00:24:20.083
greater delusions.

00:24:20.666 --> 00:24:22.375
Mr. Kuo, there you are.

00:24:22.458 --> 00:24:23.291
Please come up.

00:24:23.833 --> 00:24:26.041
It's almost time.
Get ready to say your part.

00:24:27.125 --> 00:24:28.666
- Come.
- Where's Ms. Chou?

00:24:29.666 --> 00:24:31.333
Didn't you send her to the hotel?

00:24:31.416 --> 00:24:32.416
To the hotel?

00:24:33.666 --> 00:24:34.916
Today marks the creation

00:24:35.625 --> 00:24:38.333
of the Sanching Tai Chi
Association Charity Fund.

00:24:38.833 --> 00:24:41.625
We're most honored
to have Mr. Kuo Chih-chieh with us

00:24:41.708 --> 00:24:43.250
to say a few words.

00:24:43.333 --> 00:24:45.000
- Mr. Kuo.
- Mr. Kuo.

00:24:45.083 --> 00:24:46.458
- Mr. Kuo.
- Please.

00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:00.833
I'd like to do you a favor.

00:25:00.916 --> 00:25:02.916
When you go up on stage,

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.833
make all the Sanching Tai Chi
Association's illegal activities public.

00:25:06.916 --> 00:25:08.208
What illegal activities?

00:25:08.291 --> 00:25:09.583
What're you talking about?

00:25:09.666 --> 00:25:10.958
Take a look.

00:25:11.041 --> 00:25:12.750
Your secretary gave them to me.

00:25:15.666 --> 00:25:17.166
I'd like to give you a chance.

00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:19.375
Do you want the news to report

00:25:19.458 --> 00:25:22.208
how you're a hero
who uncovered money laundering?

00:25:23.083 --> 00:25:26.250
Or do you want me to give
this information to that reporter

00:25:26.333 --> 00:25:29.625
and seal your reputation
as a corrupt politician?

00:25:31.166 --> 00:25:32.333
Your choice.

00:26:08.958 --> 00:26:10.333
Hey. Hey!

00:26:12.791 --> 00:26:14.333
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Hey.

00:26:14.416 --> 00:26:15.250
Nothing.

00:26:15.333 --> 00:26:16.416
Intrusion. Intrusion.

00:26:23.958 --> 00:26:26.541
Intrusion. Intrusion.

00:27:32.375 --> 00:27:33.500
What're you doing here?

00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:36.041
I said I'd take care of it.

00:27:36.125 --> 00:27:37.791
This mission can't go wrong.

00:27:37.875 --> 00:27:39.208
Don't worry about that.

00:27:40.958 --> 00:27:44.375
And stop interfering in this.

00:27:56.708 --> 00:27:59.125
- Hey. Hey.
- Get off. Let go of me.

00:28:01.583 --> 00:28:02.583
Who are you?

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:13.208
Charity funds

00:28:13.291 --> 00:28:14.875
are business organizations

00:28:15.375 --> 00:28:17.000
that raise and manage funds

00:28:17.083 --> 00:28:19.250
to help disadvantaged groups

00:28:19.333 --> 00:28:22.208
and promote public welfare
and social causes.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.333
They are a collective expression

00:28:26.041 --> 00:28:27.500
of human kindness and spirit.

00:28:27.875 --> 00:28:32.958
And they should enjoy widespread support
and praise from all walks of life.

00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:43.625
Are you okay?

00:28:44.625 --> 00:28:46.166
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

00:28:46.250 --> 00:28:47.083
Can you manage?

00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:05.833
But some people

00:29:06.875 --> 00:29:09.208
use charity as a front

00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:13.083
to cover illicit transactions,
launder money,

00:29:13.625 --> 00:29:16.250
and transfer funds to fraud syndicates.

00:29:16.333 --> 00:29:18.833
Mr. Kuo isn't well.
He needs to take a rest.

00:29:18.916 --> 00:29:20.875
Help him down. Thank you.

00:29:20.958 --> 00:29:22.500
I'm sorry. It's all right.

00:29:22.583 --> 00:29:24.041
Sorry, he isn't feeling well.

00:29:24.125 --> 00:29:26.083
It's fine. Everything's fine.

00:29:26.166 --> 00:29:27.333
It's okay. It's fine.

00:29:29.583 --> 00:29:30.541
Stop filming!

00:29:42.625 --> 00:29:44.250
DELETE
NO PHOTOS OR VIDEOS

00:29:45.291 --> 00:29:46.125
Silence!

00:29:46.208 --> 00:29:47.500
Silence!

00:29:47.583 --> 00:29:48.916
- Silence!
- Sit down.

00:29:50.875 --> 00:29:52.500
- Sit down.
- Everyone, stay here.

00:29:52.583 --> 00:29:53.750
Seal the place.

00:29:55.458 --> 00:29:56.708
What the hell is going on?

00:29:56.791 --> 00:29:58.625
Calm down. Everything's fine

00:29:58.708 --> 00:30:01.000
- Sit down.
- Stay where you are.

00:30:01.083 --> 00:30:02.000
Stay calm.

00:30:02.083 --> 00:30:03.833
- Sit down.
- Sit down.

00:30:04.583 --> 00:30:05.916
What's going on?

00:30:06.625 --> 00:30:07.458
Sit down!

00:30:11.250 --> 00:30:12.916
Sit down! Sit down!

00:30:13.833 --> 00:30:15.083
Sit down! Sit down!

00:30:15.875 --> 00:30:16.833
Sit down! Sit down!

00:30:25.541 --> 00:30:26.375
Mother fuckers.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:39.583
I'll deal with you later.

00:31:16.166 --> 00:31:18.291
It's all right. Everyone, it's fine.

00:31:19.375 --> 00:31:21.416
It's all right, it's…

00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:22.708
What is going on?

00:31:23.291 --> 00:31:24.666
Why has everyone passed out?

00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:26.541
Someone drugged the Sanching water.

00:31:27.208 --> 00:31:29.333
Hurry up and get the donations.

00:31:29.416 --> 00:31:31.583
My fellow Good Samaritans.

00:31:32.083 --> 00:31:34.875
I'll set an example
by donating all my assets.

00:31:35.333 --> 00:31:38.875
I hope everyone will follow suit. Here.

00:31:40.083 --> 00:31:42.666
Sister Yueh-hsin
has donated all her assets.

00:31:42.791 --> 00:31:45.250
I hope you will all support the fund.

00:31:45.333 --> 00:31:46.458
Thank you.

00:31:46.541 --> 00:31:49.541
Don't let
Mr. Kuo's behavior trouble you.

00:31:49.625 --> 00:31:52.500
Everyone, listen to me. Listen to me.

00:31:52.583 --> 00:31:54.041
- Be quiet!
- How can you--

00:31:54.125 --> 00:31:55.750
Let's stick to the schedule!

00:31:55.833 --> 00:31:57.375
Start with the donations, okay?

00:31:57.458 --> 00:32:00.833
I promise
that none of this will get out.

00:32:00.916 --> 00:32:02.833
Let's get these donations made.

00:32:02.916 --> 00:32:03.958
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:32:04.625 --> 00:32:07.000
May the heavens bless all Good Samaritans.

00:32:07.583 --> 00:32:08.791
May the heavens bless--

00:32:39.791 --> 00:32:40.958
Get off!

00:32:43.458 --> 00:32:44.291
This way.

00:32:46.166 --> 00:32:47.458
- Let me in.
- Get lost!

00:33:11.458 --> 00:33:12.291
Mom.

00:34:06.583 --> 00:34:07.708
Kai.

00:34:08.625 --> 00:34:09.875
Remember

00:34:10.375 --> 00:34:11.208
how much I--

00:34:34.666 --> 00:34:36.166
Kai. Kai.

00:34:49.708 --> 00:34:50.833
Give me the wallet.

00:34:50.916 --> 00:34:51.750
Kai.

00:34:52.333 --> 00:34:53.625
For old time's sake.

00:34:54.291 --> 00:34:56.958
We've almost finished
laundering the money.

00:34:57.041 --> 00:34:59.125
You can manage the new resort

00:34:59.708 --> 00:35:01.208
once we've purchased the land.

00:35:07.208 --> 00:35:08.500
Give me the wallet.

00:35:16.625 --> 00:35:17.666
Don't worry.

00:35:18.166 --> 00:35:19.291
It's still yours.

00:35:19.791 --> 00:35:21.791
- Passcode.
- Everything is still yours.

00:35:24.791 --> 00:35:25.750
Tell me the passcode

00:35:27.333 --> 00:35:30.458
or I'll put
everything you taught me into practice.

00:35:44.250 --> 00:35:47.291
736041.

00:35:49.416 --> 00:35:50.583
ENTER PIN TO UNLOCK

00:36:09.541 --> 00:36:11.333
Do you remember teaching me

00:36:13.125 --> 00:36:14.208
to leave no survivors?

00:38:49.708 --> 00:38:50.541
Pong.

00:38:51.375 --> 00:38:52.291
Wake up.

00:38:53.458 --> 00:38:54.416
Pong.

00:38:56.541 --> 00:38:57.583
Wake up.

00:38:58.833 --> 00:39:00.000
Wake up.

00:39:02.583 --> 00:39:03.625
Wake up.

00:39:53.583 --> 00:39:54.875
Hey.

00:39:54.958 --> 00:39:55.791
Hey!

00:39:56.333 --> 00:39:57.166
Come back!

00:39:57.791 --> 00:39:59.333
Think you can get away?

00:40:06.208 --> 00:40:07.250
See where you run to!

00:40:14.083 --> 00:40:15.583
Come out here. Hey.

00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:23.458
You knew this day would come
after you released me, right?

00:40:24.916 --> 00:40:25.750
Hey.

00:40:40.833 --> 00:40:42.166
I'm down to one bullet.

00:40:42.791 --> 00:40:44.875
I promised Hui-chun
I'd save it for you.

00:40:45.458 --> 00:40:46.833
How do you feel right now?

00:40:47.750 --> 00:40:49.166
How does betrayal feel?

00:41:42.333 --> 00:41:43.750
Did you kill Jin Jin?

00:41:47.583 --> 00:41:48.541
She's lying to you.

00:41:58.791 --> 00:42:00.583
There's only one bullet left.

00:42:02.833 --> 00:42:04.000
Don't waste it on me.

00:42:05.041 --> 00:42:07.083
I've got what I wanted.

00:42:07.458 --> 00:42:08.500
I promise you.

00:42:08.583 --> 00:42:09.625
If you let me go,

00:42:10.708 --> 00:42:13.125
you and your daughter
will never see me again.

00:42:14.416 --> 00:42:15.583
It'll be over.

00:42:18.625 --> 00:42:19.625
But not for her.

00:42:20.541 --> 00:42:21.875
As long as she's alive,

00:42:21.958 --> 00:42:23.000
she'll come for you.

00:42:24.208 --> 00:42:26.875
As long as she lives,
she'll come for you and Jin Jin.

00:42:52.125 --> 00:42:53.458
I played you all.

00:42:55.083 --> 00:42:56.250
None of them

00:42:56.333 --> 00:42:58.000
snitched about the escape.

00:42:59.958 --> 00:43:00.791
Kai.

00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:06.375
I will get you out of here.

00:43:06.458 --> 00:43:08.916
Can I bring my friends? Just two.

00:43:13.458 --> 00:43:15.166
You're as dumb as your daughters.

00:43:15.666 --> 00:43:16.833
There's zero trust.

00:43:18.208 --> 00:43:22.000
I told you
there's no real trust between people.

00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:27.000
I disagree.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:32.208
I trust Chao Ching.

00:43:48.666 --> 00:43:50.166
Eason may die.

00:43:50.708 --> 00:43:52.333
Chao Ching needs to speak to you.

00:43:53.208 --> 00:43:55.750
I'll tell you everything I know.

00:43:55.833 --> 00:43:57.791
Can you still trust me?

00:43:58.875 --> 00:44:01.541
I can help you tonight.

00:44:10.708 --> 00:44:12.916
Did you really think
you had a second chance?

00:44:19.708 --> 00:44:21.000
You done yet?

00:44:38.708 --> 00:44:40.250
You think once you're dead,

00:44:40.333 --> 00:44:41.750
it will all be over?

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:44.166
We can resurrect him.

00:44:45.583 --> 00:44:47.958
- Let's use those seven days…
- 40 million in cash.

00:44:48.041 --> 00:44:49.375
to get the justice we deserve.

00:44:51.916 --> 00:44:55.333
Now you've agreed to help us,
we'll give you a life full of hope

00:44:55.416 --> 00:44:56.333
and freedom.

00:44:56.416 --> 00:44:57.833
I'll take you to Myanmar.

00:44:57.916 --> 00:44:59.166
I'll get them all together

00:44:59.250 --> 00:45:01.500
and make a comeback.

00:45:02.833 --> 00:45:05.041
It isn't the despair that hurts the most…

00:45:06.625 --> 00:45:08.666
it's the endless hope.

00:45:42.791 --> 00:45:43.791
Is it over?

00:45:47.166 --> 00:45:48.541
Is it all over?

00:46:01.375 --> 00:46:02.791
In two hours' time,

00:46:03.625 --> 00:46:06.250
the medical flight
will take Jin Jin back to Taiwan.

00:46:08.125 --> 00:46:09.583
Go with her.

00:46:45.791 --> 00:46:46.958
Have a look.

00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:57.833
Hey.

00:47:20.583 --> 00:47:21.833
Give me the wallet.

00:47:25.291 --> 00:47:26.125
No.

00:47:53.708 --> 00:47:56.625
We got it. Let them go.

00:47:57.541 --> 00:47:59.875
If anything happens,
I'll take responsibility.

00:48:03.958 --> 00:48:04.958
Go now!

00:48:27.833 --> 00:48:29.500
- Get out of the vehicle.
- Get out!

00:48:30.083 --> 00:48:31.500
- Hurry up!
- Hey, over there!

00:48:32.375 --> 00:48:33.208
Over there!

00:48:34.541 --> 00:48:35.541
Hey, stop!

00:48:36.375 --> 00:48:37.208
Get out!

00:48:37.958 --> 00:48:38.791
Quickly!

00:48:38.875 --> 00:48:40.208
I told you to hurry, now!

00:48:40.666 --> 00:48:41.666
Hurry up! Move!

00:48:41.750 --> 00:48:44.500
Yang, we shouldn't
underestimate these influencers.

00:48:45.666 --> 00:48:47.833
They've got thousands of followers.

00:48:47.916 --> 00:48:50.708
Since we started
using social media to recruit people,

00:48:50.791 --> 00:48:52.583
our sales have increased so much.

00:48:53.083 --> 00:48:56.125
You wanted a way
to close this compound, right?

00:48:56.833 --> 00:48:57.958
I've been thinking,

00:48:58.041 --> 00:48:59.333
why not take this chance

00:49:00.416 --> 00:49:02.208
to get my mom to retire?

00:49:02.291 --> 00:49:04.291
Kai, someone like your mom

00:49:04.375 --> 00:49:05.791
is never going to step down.

00:49:05.875 --> 00:49:08.375
If she doesn't,
then Yang can just get rid of her.

00:49:09.375 --> 00:49:12.041
Nice shot! Round of applause!

00:49:19.708 --> 00:49:21.125
Look at Kai.

00:49:21.208 --> 00:49:22.750
You want the compound shut down,

00:49:22.833 --> 00:49:25.125
but all he thinks of
is getting rid of his mom.

00:49:25.708 --> 00:49:27.625
If he's happy to betray his mom today,

00:49:27.708 --> 00:49:29.541
then what about you someday?

00:49:31.250 --> 00:49:32.791
I'm just kidding.

00:49:34.875 --> 00:49:37.458
If you want the compound shut down,

00:49:38.041 --> 00:49:39.625
I have an idea.

00:49:41.875 --> 00:49:44.750
I can go to the police as a victim

00:49:44.833 --> 00:49:46.875
and get rid of him and his mother.

00:49:49.583 --> 00:49:52.958
You want to give
young people a chance, right?

00:49:54.500 --> 00:49:56.375
Well I'm younger than Chang Shih-kai.
