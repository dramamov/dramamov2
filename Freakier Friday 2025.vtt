00:46.125 --> 00:47.500
Pink Slip! Pink Slip!

00:47.583 --> 00:49.875
Pink Slip! Pink Slip!

00:49.958 --> 00:51.583
Pink Slip! Pink Slip!

01:10.958 --> 01:12.083
Text from Mom:

01:12.167 --> 01:15.208
"Hi, honey. I noticed you haven't
chimed in on the family chat."

01:15.292 --> 01:17.708
Text from Mom:
"Maybe we can all FaceTime?"

01:17.792 --> 01:20.583
Text from Mom:
"I'm just about to record a new episode."

01:21.708 --> 01:23.000
Hi. Welcome back.

01:23.083 --> 01:24.875
I'm Dr. Tess Coleman,

01:24.958 --> 01:27.583
and this is Rebelling with Respect.

01:27.667 --> 01:32.125
Today on the podcast, we are talking
about a relationship dynamic

01:32.208 --> 01:34.375
that is very close to my heart.

01:34.458 --> 01:36.833
"Grand co-parenting."

01:36.917 --> 01:39.958
When my daughter, Anna,
chose to become a single mom,

01:40.042 --> 01:41.667
it changed our family forever.

01:43.458 --> 01:45.958
Ryan! Cloffice. Recording.

01:47.625 --> 01:49.333
Sorry!

01:49.417 --> 01:54.292
As a grandma,
I was able to step up and help her.

01:58.333 --> 01:59.292
Harper!

02:01.875 --> 02:05.125
Harper, this is your 30-minute warning
that we're leaving for school.

02:06.750 --> 02:07.750
Harp?

02:08.542 --> 02:10.000
This is now your 20-minute warning.

02:10.750 --> 02:13.667
Ten minutes.
Yes, confirm the recording sessions.

02:13.750 --> 02:16.625
But know that I know
she can sell out more than the Greek.

02:16.708 --> 02:18.375
And yes, I know how many seats there are.

02:18.917 --> 02:21.333
Harper! I really wanna respect your space,

02:21.417 --> 02:23.750
but I'm curious as to why
you're not out here yet.

02:23.833 --> 02:24.792
You have five minutes!

02:24.875 --> 02:27.875
Being someone
that your loved one can lean on

02:27.958 --> 02:31.000
is the most important relationship
there is.

02:34.542 --> 02:37.583
Ryan, I'm getting so good at this!

02:40.042 --> 02:41.208
No.

02:42.333 --> 02:43.917
No, no, no!

02:44.458 --> 02:46.292
Oh, it didn't record!

02:46.792 --> 02:47.625
Moth--

02:49.042 --> 02:51.167
Hi, Mom. Now is not a great time.
I'm just...

02:51.250 --> 02:54.875
I know, but I finished my podcast early,
so I'm offering to do drop-off.

02:54.958 --> 02:57.375
No. It's okay.
I've got everything under control.

02:57.917 --> 03:01.042
Harper, you had to be up ten minutes ago!
Prepare to be triggered!

03:07.250 --> 03:08.500
Harper!

03:21.333 --> 03:22.333
Let's catch one more.

03:23.250 --> 03:25.292
Dude, these waves are unreal.

03:25.375 --> 03:27.625
I love our lives!

03:27.708 --> 03:29.542
Yo, are we skipping first period?

03:29.625 --> 03:31.125
Oh, shoot. We gotta go.

03:39.500 --> 03:40.542
-Harper!
-What?

03:41.417 --> 03:42.625
I'm literally ready.

03:42.708 --> 03:44.333
Barely. Barely.

03:44.417 --> 03:46.083
I made your favorite lunch.

03:46.708 --> 03:48.958
How was pickleball yesterday?
Did you beat 'em?

03:49.042 --> 03:50.583
We say "annihilated."

03:52.083 --> 03:54.000
Mom, I told you I could take her.

03:54.083 --> 03:55.083
I know, sweetheart.

03:55.167 --> 03:58.417
But I saw on your stories
that you were working at the studio late,

03:58.500 --> 04:00.167
and so I decided to take her.

04:00.250 --> 04:02.375
You know, it would be healthy
for you to unfollow me.

04:02.458 --> 04:04.583
And I work late all the time.
I can still take her.

04:04.667 --> 04:07.167
Anna, let's pause and reframe.

04:07.250 --> 04:09.208
When you decided to be a single mom,

04:09.292 --> 04:11.375
I told you I would support you
a hundred percent.

04:11.458 --> 04:14.000
Well, this is me supporting you
a hundred percent.

04:14.708 --> 04:16.375
Okay, you know what? I'm coming too.

04:16.458 --> 04:17.666
We can both do drop-off this morning.

04:18.416 --> 04:20.708
-Mom.
-No, go on. You can go.

04:20.791 --> 04:22.458
-Just let them...
-Oh, okay, you're not going.

04:23.208 --> 04:24.625
-Mom.
-You're gonna go.

04:24.708 --> 04:26.167
You're not... Nobody's gonna go.

04:26.250 --> 04:27.500
I'm gonna go!

04:28.417 --> 04:30.250
-So what's up, kiddo?
-Nothing.

04:31.167 --> 04:32.708
-Okay, spill it.
-All right.

04:32.792 --> 04:35.042
My new lab partner is the absolute worst.

04:35.125 --> 04:36.958
She's the new girl, here for the year.

04:37.042 --> 04:42.167
I mean, she thinks she's so much better
than everyone because she's British,

04:42.250 --> 04:45.083
which she has to remind you of
every five seconds.

04:45.167 --> 04:47.208
Like no one's ever been
from England before.

04:47.292 --> 04:49.375
So my dad opened
his third restaurant in Paris,

04:49.458 --> 04:52.208
and that's how I met
my French boyfriend, Philippe Henri.

04:52.833 --> 04:54.292
Philippe Henri.

04:55.083 --> 04:56.500
He's French and a model.

04:56.583 --> 04:58.500
You've seriously been
to Paris Fashion Week?

04:58.583 --> 04:59.917
Anna Wintour scowled at me.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.833
-Seriously?
-What's Paris like?

05:01.917 --> 05:03.875
Oh, it's lovely. I go all the time.

05:03.958 --> 05:05.792
Ignore the British girl.

05:05.875 --> 05:08.625
After this year, you won't
have to see her anymore.

05:08.708 --> 05:10.500
Nice advice from a therapist.

05:10.583 --> 05:12.583
Well, I'm not her therapist. I'm her Gram.

05:12.667 --> 05:15.667
All right, well, this has been real.
Please drive away like you don't know me.

05:16.542 --> 05:17.542
Make good choices!

05:17.625 --> 05:18.833
You are so lame.

05:19.792 --> 05:20.625
Lame!

05:21.167 --> 05:23.583
Are you ready for laboratory today?

05:23.667 --> 05:24.917
Shut your mouth.

05:26.208 --> 05:30.417
Fun bonus round today.
Never trust an atom. Why?

05:32.583 --> 05:36.250
'Cause they make up everything.
Here all day, folks.

05:36.333 --> 05:38.667
You're supposed to put your goggles on
before we start.

05:40.042 --> 05:41.708
The goggles are giving Minion.

05:41.792 --> 05:43.542
Yeah. We're not, like, Minions.

05:44.333 --> 05:46.917
So, no, thank you.
But they're perfect for you.

05:48.292 --> 05:50.542
It's like the Revolutionary War
was for nothing.

05:51.333 --> 05:55.083
Today, remember,
these are dangerous chemicals.

05:55.167 --> 05:56.750
Maybe we should use
not-dangerous chemicals?

05:56.833 --> 05:59.542
How about you do your actual share
of the work instead of doodling?

05:59.625 --> 06:00.833
It's called designing.

06:01.500 --> 06:03.083
The measurements have to be precise.

06:03.958 --> 06:07.542
This experiment is so simple.
In the UK, we did this in primary school.

06:08.667 --> 06:12.708
The only reason people think you're smart
is because of your obnoxious accent.

06:12.792 --> 06:15.208
At least people think I'm clever.

06:15.292 --> 06:16.750
What's that supposed to mean?

06:16.833 --> 06:18.500
You're smart. Figure it out.

06:20.792 --> 06:21.958
-Oh, no.
-Oh, no.

06:22.042 --> 06:23.208
-Oh, no.
-Oh, no.

06:23.292 --> 06:24.500
Oh, no.

06:27.208 --> 06:30.000
-That was not precise!
-That's not precise at all!

06:32.333 --> 06:33.583
Principal Waldman!

06:33.667 --> 06:36.458
I don't know, Mom. I don't know why
the principal called me, but I'm here.

06:36.542 --> 06:38.083
So you don't need to come. You know what?

06:38.167 --> 06:40.458
I can't find what I was gonna
tell you about. I'll call you...

06:41.500 --> 06:43.042
-Sorry.
-It's totally my fault.

06:43.125 --> 06:45.375
No, no, no.
I wasn't looking where I was going.

06:52.958 --> 06:53.792
Are you okay?

06:56.333 --> 06:58.125
-Your... your phone.
-Yeah, I...

06:58.208 --> 07:00.500
Yeah, I don't know
how to turn this thing off.

07:00.583 --> 07:02.375
Yeah, I'm not sure, either.
I think, maybe...

07:02.458 --> 07:03.625
-I think you got it.
-Is it off?

07:03.708 --> 07:05.292
-Yeah. It's just...
-Thank you.

07:05.375 --> 07:06.792
-No problem.
-Thank you.

07:09.333 --> 07:12.167
My daughter just started here,
and I admit I'm quite lost.

07:12.250 --> 07:14.083
Would you happen to know
where the chemistry lab is?

07:14.167 --> 07:16.833
This is serious.
Someone could have been injured.

07:16.917 --> 07:18.542
I'm sure it was just an accident.

07:19.292 --> 07:21.292
It seems to me a misunderstanding.

07:21.375 --> 07:23.958
Harper seems so...

07:24.917 --> 07:25.958
lovely.

07:27.375 --> 07:30.292
Well, Lily seems so genuine and kind.

07:32.167 --> 07:36.917
Wow. I certainly never had two parents
come in here and be this attractive.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.625
I meant "attentive."

07:40.000 --> 07:44.583
Lily and I are definitely going to reflect
on how to do better.

07:44.667 --> 07:48.083
This is all Harper and I
are going to think about.

07:48.167 --> 07:50.917
We're very, very committed.

07:51.000 --> 07:55.083
Especially as a single-parent household.

07:55.167 --> 07:56.417
Oh, us too.

07:56.500 --> 07:57.833
-We're single. Parent.
-Great.

07:57.917 --> 07:58.917
I mean...

07:59.583 --> 08:02.000
-I'm a single parent, yeah.
-Single parent. Great.

08:02.083 --> 08:03.708
-Yeah. You know what I mean.
-Yes. Same. Me too.

08:04.500 --> 08:05.583
Single.

08:05.667 --> 08:07.083
Single parent. Guilty.

08:07.167 --> 08:08.167
Great.

08:08.250 --> 08:09.583
I'm single too.

08:09.667 --> 08:11.250
Oh, my God... Should we meet up?

08:11.333 --> 08:13.583
Perhaps our daughters
should get to know each other?

08:13.667 --> 08:16.167
Maybe, like, Wednesdays, after 6:00.
Get a little wine?

08:16.250 --> 08:18.000
Talk about these badass kids?

08:18.083 --> 08:19.667
Harper would really like that.

08:19.750 --> 08:21.000
Over dinner?

08:21.083 --> 08:22.458
Dinner sounds perfect.

08:22.542 --> 08:23.542
I'm on it.

08:24.958 --> 08:28.375
Petit Trois?
Yes, can I have a table for two?

08:28.458 --> 08:30.833
Private. In the back.

08:30.917 --> 08:32.375
Do you guys have any allergies?

08:32.457 --> 08:33.625
-No.
-No.

08:33.707 --> 08:34.875
No. No allergies.

09:24.250 --> 09:26.958
Okay, you came here early. Spill it.

09:27.042 --> 09:28.458
There's just no time.

09:28.542 --> 09:32.167
Bachelorette party, dance rehearsal,
final fitting, rehearsal lunch.

09:32.250 --> 09:33.792
And, oh, my wedding.

09:33.875 --> 09:37.042
You have a lot on your plate.
Big day. Deep breath.

09:37.125 --> 09:39.708
-There's so much to do before Sunday.
-Anna, let us know how we can help.

09:39.792 --> 09:41.917
Maybe someone could help me
memorize my wedding vows.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.375
How about this? I'll help you.

09:43.458 --> 09:45.458
"I, Anna, take you, Eric,

09:45.542 --> 09:48.208
a man that I have been dating
for six months,

09:48.292 --> 09:51.125
but might uproot my entire life
and move to London,

09:51.208 --> 09:55.083
where we have no family
and an avocado costs $11."

09:55.167 --> 09:59.958
Perhaps you should add something about
my undying patience for teenage rebellion.

10:00.042 --> 10:01.083
Spot on about the avocado.

10:01.167 --> 10:02.833
Oh. That wasn't about you.

10:02.917 --> 10:05.333
It was actually about my mom's
other British fiancé.

10:05.417 --> 10:06.458
She's a comedian today.

10:06.542 --> 10:07.917
-Just today, though.
-I see. Yeah.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.583
-Right, Harper?
-I have been practicing our first dance.

10:10.667 --> 10:12.167
Wait till you see what I have cooking.

10:13.083 --> 10:14.375
I see what you did there.

10:14.458 --> 10:16.292
I missed you since yesterday.

10:16.375 --> 10:18.208
Ew.

10:18.292 --> 10:20.875
Trevor Travis just dropped a new single.

10:20.958 --> 10:22.833
I think we can all guess
who it might be about.

10:24.250 --> 10:25.250
Hello?

10:27.250 --> 10:31.375
I had my pastry chef make sticky toffee
pudding pavlova for the bake sale.

10:31.458 --> 10:34.500
Just what every teenager loves. Pavlova.

10:34.583 --> 10:37.167
Agreed. Teenagers these days,
sophisticated palates.

10:37.250 --> 10:39.500
Yes, well, this pastry chef

10:39.583 --> 10:43.208
was up at 4:00 a.m. baking
old-fashioned chocolate chip cookies

10:43.292 --> 10:45.000
from scratch, with no staff.

10:45.083 --> 10:47.625
Four hours for cookies?

10:47.708 --> 10:49.292
I think we need to get you a staff.

10:51.167 --> 10:52.875
They just needed to cool.

10:52.958 --> 10:54.333
Stand up straight. Good posture.

10:54.417 --> 10:55.875
Okay. And do you know
how bad this is for you?

10:55.958 --> 10:57.792
Seriously, eat this.

10:57.875 --> 10:59.833
Say, "Thanks, Mom."

10:59.917 --> 11:00.958
I saw that, Harper.

11:02.083 --> 11:03.375
Any day now.

11:04.750 --> 11:06.417
Just trying to keep us on a schedule here.

11:06.500 --> 11:10.083
Oi. Well, we wouldn't want
to be off schedule, innit?

11:10.167 --> 11:11.167
Step, and...

11:11.250 --> 11:12.417
Hi, Lil!

11:12.500 --> 11:13.542
It's Lily.

11:13.625 --> 11:15.042
Lily, back seat.

11:15.833 --> 11:17.125
Can't Grams just take me?

11:17.208 --> 11:19.042
No, this will be good bonding
for everyone.

11:19.625 --> 11:22.833
Well, I bond best with Lily
when we're not around each other,

11:22.917 --> 11:25.042
and I don't have to look at her face.

11:25.125 --> 11:28.417
Yeah, I love sitting next to you.
Reminds me that I'm amazing.

11:28.500 --> 11:29.583
Seatbelts, girls.

11:37.167 --> 11:38.625
All right. All right.

11:38.708 --> 11:39.958
-I got you.
-You got me.

11:40.042 --> 11:41.833
-Good morning.
-We're ready to go. Good morning.

11:41.917 --> 11:44.250
Car's all set. Up the coast, Route 1?

11:44.333 --> 11:46.958
-Yeah?
-Yeah? What do you think?

11:47.042 --> 11:50.083
I'm not saying
I don't not want to go on the trip.

11:50.167 --> 11:55.167
I'm just saying that Anna's wedding
has put me behind with my patients,

11:55.250 --> 11:57.917
which has been very disruptive.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.750
And... And, of course,

12:00.333 --> 12:05.333
they keep adding dates to my book tour,
which, you know, it's out of my control.

12:05.958 --> 12:07.542
And I'm just saying I need a little time.

12:07.625 --> 12:11.458
Look, girls. We're trying to hear you.
Just try and hear us?

12:11.542 --> 12:16.792
Oh, no. I hear you trying to pull me away
from my family and my friends.

12:16.875 --> 12:19.417
I mean, who even gets to surf
before school in London?

12:19.500 --> 12:21.708
You can surf on the river Thames.

12:21.792 --> 12:23.250
Really?

12:23.333 --> 12:24.583
No, you dipstick.

12:24.667 --> 12:26.000
-Girls.
-It's a city.

12:26.083 --> 12:28.333
-You need to--
-Okay, girls. Girls. It's our decision.

12:28.875 --> 12:31.042
Eric and I will do what's right
for the family.

12:31.125 --> 12:32.542
Family?

12:32.625 --> 12:33.833
Yes, this family.

12:33.917 --> 12:35.500
-Don't say it like that.
-Don't say--

12:35.583 --> 12:37.917
-That sounds really cringe.
-Don't tell me what to say and how to say.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.542
Harper, relax. Don't be so dramatic.

12:39.625 --> 12:40.750
Lily.

12:40.833 --> 12:42.542
-Stop gaslighting.
-What?

12:42.625 --> 12:44.958
You don't even know what that means.

12:45.042 --> 12:47.292
-I don't wanna look at your face anymore.
-You know what that means, right?

12:47.375 --> 12:49.208
-I think I know what it means.
-Yeah. I knew you did.

12:49.292 --> 12:51.333
That explains why you talk rubbish.

12:51.417 --> 12:54.333
For the bake sale today,
every table must have...

12:54.417 --> 12:55.417
Okay.

12:55.500 --> 12:57.083
...a gluten-free option,
an egg-free option...

12:57.167 --> 12:58.708
Please don't slam the...

13:00.292 --> 13:01.417
door.

13:02.250 --> 13:05.917
Well, at least we don't have to bring them
to our immigration interview tomorrow.

13:06.708 --> 13:09.042
Don't be stressed. They'll come round.

13:10.042 --> 13:12.125
Yeah, let them take
all the time they need.

13:16.458 --> 13:17.917
He sounds great. I'll be back in a bit.

13:18.750 --> 13:20.458
-Here's Ella's schedule.
-Thank you.

13:21.250 --> 13:22.792
Oh, send those
to the tour manager, please.

13:22.875 --> 13:25.042
-Yeah, okay.
-Okay? Because I'm...

13:25.125 --> 13:26.958
-I'm a pop star on the rise.
-Okay.

13:27.042 --> 13:29.792
So I wanna do the album, you know.
We can come in here after midnight.

13:29.875 --> 13:31.375
I got the keys to the studio.

13:31.458 --> 13:33.417
-How's it going?
-Oh, good morning.

13:33.500 --> 13:35.458
Actually, it's literally not.
It's a bad morning.

13:35.542 --> 13:38.500
It's a very bad morning.
Not for me, personally, but for you.

13:38.583 --> 13:39.583
Why, what happened?

13:40.208 --> 13:41.667
Trevor dumped Ella.

13:41.750 --> 13:43.458
And he already released a song about it.

13:43.542 --> 13:45.292
Anna!

13:46.292 --> 13:47.958
Yeah, and he dumped her in a text.

13:48.042 --> 13:49.708
-Yeah, I got this.
-Toxic icon.

13:50.583 --> 13:52.875
I'll get in the booth,
and I'ma just lay it all down...

13:53.750 --> 13:57.292
Okay, so Trevor wrote a song.
But I'm sure it's not as bad as you think.

13:57.375 --> 14:00.083
It's called "Better Than the Last One."
It's about me.

14:00.167 --> 14:03.083
Okay, but that title,
it could be about anyone.

14:03.167 --> 14:05.458
It says, parentheses, "Ella."

14:05.542 --> 14:08.458
Let's just focus on the songs
that you're gonna perform on Saturday.

14:08.542 --> 14:10.167
Performing! Yay!

14:10.250 --> 14:14.708
I can't sing those songs.
I wrote them about Trevor.

14:14.792 --> 14:16.958
I put my heart and soul into them.

14:17.042 --> 14:20.333
No, a 44-year-old Dutch music producer
wrote those songs.

14:23.292 --> 14:26.667
This is a hit! This is...
I can't even stop moving my body.

14:26.750 --> 14:28.292
Look, my chest is just gyrating.
I can't...

14:28.375 --> 14:29.292
Off!

14:30.208 --> 14:31.500
Oh, turn it off. Turn... All right.

14:33.958 --> 14:36.250
What is that?
Did you learn that from Oprah?

14:36.333 --> 14:37.333
Join the Environmental Club.

14:37.417 --> 14:39.667
Come over.
We have the best cookies in town.

14:39.750 --> 14:41.375
Welcome to the great
Sunset Ridge Bake-Off.

14:41.458 --> 14:43.542
Shouldn't these be more
prominently featured?

14:43.625 --> 14:46.667
Bon Appétit literally profiled
my dad's restaurant for these pastries.

14:46.750 --> 14:49.750
I think they're nice and prominent
over here.

14:49.833 --> 14:50.958
They're gourmet.

14:51.042 --> 14:52.333
They're soggy-bottomed.

14:52.417 --> 14:55.792
You know what? I think I see
the perfect spot for yours.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
-Just...
-Dude!

14:58.083 --> 15:00.375
-Those were Gram's!
-Come on.

15:00.458 --> 15:05.500
You know what? I think I know
the perfect place to put this.

15:05.583 --> 15:07.583
You wouldn't dare.

15:13.500 --> 15:15.042
Yeah. Perfect.

15:15.125 --> 15:16.583
Nice caramelization.

15:18.208 --> 15:19.042
Just...

15:20.417 --> 15:21.708
Oh, my God.

15:27.833 --> 15:29.667
Food fight!

15:29.750 --> 15:30.750
Oh, no!

15:34.958 --> 15:36.583
They're attacking us from above!

15:37.375 --> 15:39.167
We need the high ground!

15:45.542 --> 15:46.833
On my signal!

15:55.208 --> 15:56.583
Too far, Harper.

15:57.208 --> 15:59.417
Stop it! Put that down! Stop it.

15:59.500 --> 16:01.417
Give me that. Give me that.
Put that down. Stop it!

16:01.500 --> 16:02.917
No, not the strudel!

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
Please! Or the tart.

16:14.458 --> 16:16.208
Stop it! That got in my mouth!

16:19.417 --> 16:21.125
You want a fight? Let's fight!

16:39.250 --> 16:40.750
Who started...

16:41.833 --> 16:42.958
the food fight?

16:45.375 --> 16:47.000
Congratulations, you two.

16:47.083 --> 16:49.792
You just got everybody in here
in-school suspension.

16:50.667 --> 16:51.667
Thanks a lot.

16:51.750 --> 16:53.750
Is this key lime pie?

16:53.833 --> 16:56.125
Yeah, I baked it fresh this morning.

16:56.208 --> 16:57.792
Well, you gotta take me
to the emergency room

16:57.875 --> 17:00.542
because I'm very allergic to key lime pie.

17:08.166 --> 17:09.375
Is this you?

17:13.125 --> 17:14.458
That's not supposed to be in there.

17:15.291 --> 17:16.500
Was it for Pink Slip?

17:16.583 --> 17:18.625
I saw them at the Troubadour last year.

17:20.791 --> 17:22.833
Could I sing your song this weekend?

17:22.916 --> 17:25.833
Oh, no. You'll have way better stuff
than something I wrote.

17:25.916 --> 17:28.041
I wrote that
after I left Pink Slip anyway.

17:28.125 --> 17:30.917
Okay. I got this.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.333
Yes, you got this.

17:32.417 --> 17:37.167
Opening your world tour at the Wiltern
is a big show for you. Huge.

17:38.542 --> 17:39.667
For the both of us.

17:39.750 --> 17:42.208
The girls are struggling
with this transition, and just...

17:42.292 --> 17:44.958
just take it from a parent
who has been in your shoes.

17:45.042 --> 17:48.083
I know, Tess, between losing
Lily's mum and moving here...

17:48.167 --> 17:51.375
Yes, and being ripped away
from the home she grew up in.

17:51.458 --> 17:53.208
Oh, I'm sorry.
Are we talking about Lily or about Harper?

17:53.292 --> 17:54.917
-Harp? Lily?
-That is really annoying.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.292
-No, it's just...
-Hey. What the...

17:57.375 --> 17:59.000
What's going on?

17:59.083 --> 18:00.208
-Darling...
-No one's hurt.

18:00.292 --> 18:02.125
-I went to the school...
-Please let me just handle this.

18:03.958 --> 18:07.458
Anna, there's been an incident at school
between the girls. It was really bad.

18:07.542 --> 18:08.958
What bad? How bad?

18:11.250 --> 18:14.167
I've got this. Girls, apologize
to each other now, please.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.750
Honey, forced apologies is never
a way to resolve conflict.

18:17.833 --> 18:18.833
-That...
-But...

18:18.917 --> 18:21.792
We need to make space for them
to express how they feel.

18:23.667 --> 18:25.542
Harper, how do you feel?

18:27.042 --> 18:28.750
I feel...

18:28.833 --> 18:29.708
sorry.

18:30.583 --> 18:32.125
And, Lily, how do you feel?

18:32.917 --> 18:34.417
I feel...

18:34.500 --> 18:35.333
sorry too.

18:35.417 --> 18:36.500
That's great.

18:36.583 --> 18:37.417
-Great.
-See?

18:37.500 --> 18:39.208
Sorry that my future stepsister
is a complete twit.

18:39.292 --> 18:41.375
I'm sorry that my future stepsister
is a shallow idiot.

18:41.458 --> 18:43.375
-Oh, am I? Really?
-New plan!

18:43.458 --> 18:45.000
No more holding space for feelings.

18:45.083 --> 18:47.875
You two are gonna have a lovely time
at my bachelorette tonight.

18:47.958 --> 18:49.542
You're gonna get along
because we're a family,

18:49.625 --> 18:50.750
and families love each other!

18:50.833 --> 18:52.792
And for that, Harper, just for that look,

18:52.875 --> 18:56.125
you two earned yourself
a sleepover at Gram's.

18:57.917 --> 19:00.958
Why am I the punishment? I'm the fun one.

19:01.042 --> 19:02.500
-I have board games.
-Mom.

19:02.583 --> 19:04.000
I have Parcheesi.

19:04.083 --> 19:05.500
And you're gonna braid each other's hair

19:05.583 --> 19:08.208
in a non cultural-appropriating way
and like it.

19:08.292 --> 19:09.375
What is Parcheesi?

19:09.458 --> 19:10.833
-It's a game.
-I'm not quite sure.

19:10.917 --> 19:13.000
You move around the board.
You shake the dice.

19:13.083 --> 19:15.542
You remember the sound of the dice?
Oh, it's amazing.

19:15.625 --> 19:17.917
You get these dice,
and you shake 'em in your hand,

19:18.000 --> 19:19.667
-and then you move around the board.
-Oh, Grams.

19:19.750 --> 19:20.833
It's really fun.

19:20.917 --> 19:22.542
I also have Boggle!

19:22.625 --> 19:24.958
You stay on your side,
and I'll stay on mine.

19:26.042 --> 19:27.042
Gladly.

19:28.333 --> 19:31.167
Harper, look, I know
you think I don't get it, but I do.

19:31.250 --> 19:32.750
And it's still just gonna be you and me.

19:32.833 --> 19:36.167
If you go to London,
I'm staying here with Grams.

19:36.250 --> 19:37.792
-She said it was cool.
-She what?

19:37.875 --> 19:42.000
Hey, Anna! Did you remove me
as Harper's secondary contact?

19:42.083 --> 19:44.708
Did you tell Harper
that she could stay here with you

19:44.792 --> 19:46.667
if we decided to move to London?

19:48.292 --> 19:50.750
-Are you serious right now?
-Whoa. Are you serious?

19:50.833 --> 19:51.833
-Okay, okay.
-Why are you--

19:51.917 --> 19:56.958
What is serious is that you and Eric
need to keep the girls in Los Angeles.

19:57.042 --> 19:59.375
Lily just needs some guidance.

19:59.917 --> 20:02.792
The only guidance I need from you
is to show me to the other bathroom.

20:04.625 --> 20:06.750
I'm very sorry, Lily. I didn't know--

20:06.833 --> 20:10.167
You don't know anything
about what I need or how I feel,

20:10.250 --> 20:12.875
or the fashion school
back home that I wanna go to.

20:14.542 --> 20:16.708
Yep. Just you and me, Mom.

20:17.417 --> 20:18.417
Great.

20:18.500 --> 20:23.042
Welcome, everyone, to
the bachelorette party of our girl, Anna.

20:27.208 --> 20:29.375
Mom, for real? Why would you?

20:30.458 --> 20:32.375
-Haven't changed.
-Not a bit.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.875
-Anna!
-It's so funny.

20:35.958 --> 20:36.792
Get it, girl!

20:36.875 --> 20:38.167
I remember that six-pack.

20:38.250 --> 20:40.333
-Yeah, who is that?
-So handsome.

20:40.417 --> 20:42.208
That is Jake.

20:42.833 --> 20:44.292
Your mom's first love.

20:44.375 --> 20:46.458
And her first ride on a motorcycle.

20:46.542 --> 20:49.375
I like to ride in Jake's motorcycle.

20:49.458 --> 20:52.792
-Okay.
-Jake also had a thing for Tess.

20:52.875 --> 20:53.708
For Grams?

20:53.792 --> 20:56.083
All right, okay.
Enough humiliation for the night.

21:10.625 --> 21:14.042
Harper, baby, I made you a plate.

21:14.125 --> 21:16.667
Here you go.
You're too young to be sad. Come on.

21:16.750 --> 21:18.792
Well, being young is overrated, Mama P.

21:18.875 --> 21:19.917
Eat. You'll be fine.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.042
Use the tongs.

21:43.042 --> 21:45.583
Lily? Mind if I join you?

21:49.917 --> 21:55.333
You know, Anna lost her father around
the same age that you lost your mother.

21:57.458 --> 22:00.500
And then she had to deal with
my wedding to Ryan.

22:00.583 --> 22:01.958
Cool.

22:03.000 --> 22:06.792
And then you add to that
the complications of moving.

22:07.917 --> 22:08.917
I'm here for you.

22:10.875 --> 22:12.042
Sincerely.

22:15.542 --> 22:20.750
With all due respect, Dr. Coleman,
you're not my gran or my therapist.

22:20.833 --> 22:22.833
So, while I get your motive
for keeping us in LA,

22:23.750 --> 22:25.042
I don't need your help.

22:30.333 --> 22:33.083
Oh, no. We used to be so cool.

22:33.167 --> 22:35.875
-Hey, I'm still cool.
-I look amazing.

22:35.958 --> 22:37.792
You're very cool.
That song you sent me was sick.

22:37.875 --> 22:39.000
-Yeah.
-Thank you.

22:39.083 --> 22:40.500
-Yeah.
-Yeah. I wish I had more time to write.

22:40.583 --> 22:42.917
But now all I do is
listen to parenting podcasts.

22:43.000 --> 22:46.167
Well, I'm sorry for ruining
your exciting rock star life.

22:46.250 --> 22:47.542
-Harper, wait. I was just--
-I'll take it.

22:48.292 --> 22:49.958
Wait, I wasn't serious.

22:50.042 --> 22:52.167
Look, I gave up performing,
but I have you.

22:52.250 --> 22:55.542
-Enjoy your party.
-You can't leave.

22:56.083 --> 22:57.917
-Let's just--
-I don't think I belong in here, Grams.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.708
-Just let me handle this. I've got you.
-Harper!

22:59.792 --> 23:03.250
Anna, honey, you just need
to pause and reframe.

23:03.333 --> 23:04.917
-Thanks, Mom.
-What?

23:05.000 --> 23:06.417
-What did I do?
-I was handling it.

23:06.500 --> 23:08.167
And you completely undermine me
as a parent.

23:08.250 --> 23:10.583
-I was trying to help you.
-Well, your help isn't helpful.

23:10.667 --> 23:12.625
Well, that's not very nice to say.

23:12.708 --> 23:15.458
-I've been here for you--
-Can the great and mysterious Madame Jen

23:15.542 --> 23:17.875
interest you ladies in a psychic reading?

23:19.542 --> 23:23.167
No. Thank you very much,
but right now is not the...

23:23.250 --> 23:24.292
Time?

23:24.375 --> 23:26.417
-It's just not really our...
-Thing?

23:26.500 --> 23:28.917
This will all be over soon, if you just...

23:30.042 --> 23:31.833
-Go with it.
-Go with it. Yes, exactly.

23:31.917 --> 23:33.167
-Come on in. Yes. Yes.
-No. No.

23:33.250 --> 23:34.417
-Come.
-Okay, I'm coming. Here we go.

23:34.500 --> 23:35.792
-Anybody else interested?
-Let's try this out.

23:35.875 --> 23:39.458
I do discounts for bigger groups. Okay?
Okay. That's fine. That's good.

23:41.042 --> 23:44.167
And that's how I lost my spot
at the Larchmont Farmers Market.

23:44.250 --> 23:49.333
But I did get a table by the lids and free
milk counter inside of the Starbucks.

23:49.417 --> 23:53.417
So, I am a life coach,
but I also do Reiki.

23:53.500 --> 23:55.500
If you notice,
I have several business cards,

23:55.583 --> 23:59.083
because I actually have
a business-card-making business.

23:59.167 --> 24:00.292
So, that's the card for that.

24:00.375 --> 24:03.958
I can put quotes on there
that I can just make up for you.

24:04.042 --> 24:06.292
If you want something
inspirational, for example,

24:06.375 --> 24:12.167
I can make up a quote
like "Live your life, gosh dang it."

24:12.250 --> 24:13.667
-Okay.
-So, here's--

24:13.750 --> 24:18.708
And I'm gonna read your palms now.

24:18.792 --> 24:19.958
-'Cause that's--
-Really?

24:22.792 --> 24:27.125
Okay. And there they go. Yes.

24:28.042 --> 24:29.500
Eenie, meenie, miney...

24:32.000 --> 24:35.000
Okay. It smells like
you had some appetizers.

24:35.083 --> 24:36.208
-Were they good?
-Good.

24:36.292 --> 24:37.542
-Good. Yes.
-Yeah. Yes.

24:38.250 --> 24:39.708
And did you have any, Mom?

24:41.542 --> 24:46.583
-No. No. I didn't. 'Cause I paid for them.
-I'm-- No. No. Didn't-- I paid for them.

24:46.667 --> 24:49.875
-It's a wedding. Okay.
-Okay. Okay, okay.

24:49.958 --> 24:53.625
Your life lines. It's like they've...

24:56.333 --> 24:58.042
intersected before.

24:58.708 --> 25:00.125
-How strange.
-Really?

25:01.667 --> 25:04.833
You've walked in each other's path.

25:06.083 --> 25:11.625
It's like a crazy path-cross
that you've done.

25:16.583 --> 25:20.875
You've learned a lesson.
A lesson that may serve you again.

25:20.958 --> 25:22.625
-Okay. That's enough.
-Thank you. Okay.

25:22.708 --> 25:24.125
We'll give these to my neighbors.

25:24.208 --> 25:25.708
I'm onto something here.

25:25.792 --> 25:26.917
One more thing.

25:28.708 --> 25:31.292
Right over there is a QR code
that you can tip me with.

25:31.375 --> 25:33.542
Any amount is appreciated. Really.

25:33.625 --> 25:35.500
I didn't know I could do that voice.

25:35.583 --> 25:37.958
-Nice prank.
-Yeah, we know what you did.

25:38.042 --> 25:39.167
What did I do?

25:39.250 --> 25:41.500
-What do you mean? The psychic.
-Yeah. Telling her about--

25:41.583 --> 25:45.500
What-- Okay, okay.
You think I'd rather solve your problem

25:45.583 --> 25:49.000
than deal with my booming culinary empire.

25:54.250 --> 25:56.333
-I'm following you because--
-You're happy here, so...

25:56.417 --> 25:57.417
Are you the psychic?

25:57.500 --> 26:00.042
I need you to look into my future
and tell me where we're going to live.

26:00.958 --> 26:03.375
Cool Gen Z talking to me.

26:03.458 --> 26:05.583
If it's not London,
I need you to alter my destiny.

26:05.667 --> 26:08.625
And I literally have to stay
in Los Angeles, so, if there's--

26:08.708 --> 26:10.708
Well, that's not really how it works.

26:11.708 --> 26:13.000
Well, how does it work?

26:14.333 --> 26:17.833
Girls, follow my aura.

26:18.833 --> 26:21.417
Boop. Beep.

26:22.458 --> 26:25.667
You don't have a lot of lines in
your hands, so it makes it harder for me.

26:25.750 --> 26:27.833
You two are called to be family.

26:27.917 --> 26:30.208
-Yeah, right.
-Don't remind me.

26:32.250 --> 26:33.792
A lesson for you all.

26:36.208 --> 26:37.750
I see it now.

26:42.583 --> 26:47.167
Change the hearts you know are wrong
to reach the place where you belong.

26:47.667 --> 26:52.083
Change the hearts you know are wrong
to reach the place where you belong.

26:52.833 --> 26:55.000
Change the hearts you know are wrong...

26:55.083 --> 26:57.333
Why is she rhyming like a bridge troll?

26:57.833 --> 27:03.458
Change the hearts you know are wrong
to reach the place where you belong.

27:03.542 --> 27:05.667
-Change the hearts...
-Earthquake.

27:05.750 --> 27:07.250
Earthquake?

27:31.375 --> 27:32.375
Did you feel that?

27:34.083 --> 27:36.167
Yeah, I... It must be the dancing.

27:37.167 --> 27:40.667
Yeah, right. We're just
freaking ourselves out for no reason.

27:40.750 --> 27:43.250
-Yeah. It's just in our heads.
-Right.

27:43.333 --> 27:46.583
-With your surf forecast...
-All cozy and tucked in?

27:47.083 --> 27:49.292
Fearless prediction
for the full moon tonight--

27:50.667 --> 27:51.667
You need anything?

27:52.250 --> 27:54.125
What more could I possibly need?

27:54.208 --> 27:57.208
How about sleeping in our own beds
in our own rooms?

28:00.583 --> 28:01.583
Sweet dreams.

28:04.500 --> 28:05.750
Teenagers.

28:05.833 --> 28:07.042
I was one once.

28:07.125 --> 28:09.125
Yeah, so was I. Twice.

28:09.208 --> 28:10.833
-Night.
-Night. Love you.

28:10.917 --> 28:11.917
Love you too, honey.

28:32.500 --> 28:34.750
Change the hearts you know are wrong

28:34.833 --> 28:37.583
to reach the place where you belong.

28:37.667 --> 28:39.917
Change the hearts you know are wrong

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
to reach the place where you belong.

28:48.375 --> 28:50.000
I don't have an alarm.

28:52.542 --> 28:54.375
Why do my hands look so dry?

28:56.000 --> 28:57.583
Why am I so tired?

29:00.167 --> 29:01.208
Mom?

29:01.292 --> 29:02.542
Mom?

29:03.542 --> 29:04.875
-Grams?
-Grams?

29:08.708 --> 29:12.667
Grams. Grams, are you okay?

29:13.583 --> 29:16.583
Why are you bloody waking me up for?

29:16.667 --> 29:18.417
-Are you mad?
-Mad?

29:18.917 --> 29:20.208
Why do I sound like this?

29:20.292 --> 29:21.625
Sound like what?

29:22.458 --> 29:23.667
American!

29:28.792 --> 29:30.000
Good. Mom.

29:30.958 --> 29:32.167
What was that?

29:36.208 --> 29:37.208
Lily, are you okay?

29:38.042 --> 29:39.792
I'm not Lily.

29:45.667 --> 29:46.708
Are you Harper?

29:48.208 --> 29:49.708
No.

29:49.792 --> 29:53.625
No. No. No, no, no.

29:54.458 --> 29:57.875
-I'm bloody decomposing!
-Oh, my.

30:03.625 --> 30:04.833
Harper?

30:04.917 --> 30:08.583
-Oh, my God. What is happening?
-I know.

30:08.667 --> 30:10.292
It's me, Harp. It's Mom.

30:10.375 --> 30:14.375
What are you saying? So if you're me
and I'm you, then who is that?

30:15.292 --> 30:16.583
I'm Grandma, sweetheart.

30:22.750 --> 30:25.208
Oh, my gosh! I've died.

30:25.292 --> 30:27.667
I killed myself!

30:27.750 --> 30:32.125
She just has crevices all over her face.
Look at the crevices.

30:32.208 --> 30:34.042
My hands look like doll hands.

30:34.125 --> 30:36.000
My butt feels so high.

30:36.083 --> 30:37.500
I think I just peed a little.

30:37.583 --> 30:38.833
Oh, no.

30:38.917 --> 30:42.250
My face feels so thirsty and dry.

30:42.333 --> 30:44.833
My face is perfect.

30:44.917 --> 30:50.583
My face looks like a Birkin bag
that's been left out in the sun to rot.

30:51.292 --> 30:52.375
Why?

30:52.458 --> 30:54.292
Why do I have to pee again?

30:54.375 --> 30:56.750
This is so much weirder
than the last time.

30:56.833 --> 30:58.542
Last time? What last time?

30:58.625 --> 31:00.167
How come you never told me?

31:00.250 --> 31:02.417
We never told anyone, sweetheart.
Overnight oats.

31:02.500 --> 31:04.250
Now let's just pause and reframe.

31:04.333 --> 31:06.333
No. I didn't want to be
a part of this family

31:06.417 --> 31:09.417
and now I'm part
of some dodgy family curse?

31:09.500 --> 31:11.417
-And I'm the eldest?
-Mom.

31:11.500 --> 31:14.792
And where are her lips? She has no lips!

31:14.875 --> 31:15.917
Where did they go?

31:16.000 --> 31:17.250
How do we fix this?

31:18.292 --> 31:19.958
Well, you know, last time,
we switched back

31:20.042 --> 31:22.458
when we saw things
from the other's perspective.

31:22.542 --> 31:24.500
-Should we hold hands? Hold my hands.
-Well, we can--

31:25.000 --> 31:26.458
-Just...
-Yeah.

31:27.333 --> 31:29.375
I know I've been hard on you and Eric,

31:29.458 --> 31:32.083
but I can now see
that you're doing the right thing.

31:32.167 --> 31:37.500
And, Mom, you have always done
so much for me, and I see you.

31:42.333 --> 31:43.708
I see you.

31:43.792 --> 31:45.333
-Are you really seeing me though?
-I really see you.

31:45.417 --> 31:46.750
Because I don't feel anything.

31:46.833 --> 31:49.333
You have no idea how hard
I'm seeing you right now.

31:49.417 --> 31:50.958
-One, two, three.
-...three.

31:52.542 --> 31:54.917
-Girls, that doesn't work.
-Yeah, we tried that last time.

31:56.208 --> 32:00.750
Looking like this is why
people like you become shut-ins,

32:00.833 --> 32:03.375
and what's with this accent? "Tomato."

32:03.458 --> 32:05.375
Is that what you think I sound like?

32:05.458 --> 32:08.792
Oh, my God, yes.
Of course this is what you sound like.

32:08.875 --> 32:10.125
-Let's go to Erewhon...
-I do not sound like that.

32:10.208 --> 32:11.667
-...and get an immunity booster.
-I've never said that.

32:11.750 --> 32:14.500
-I don't even know what Erewhon is.
-Then I need to call my energy healer

32:14.583 --> 32:16.083
because I need a chakra reset.

32:16.167 --> 32:18.000
-Yes! That's what you sound like.
-The healer.

32:19.208 --> 32:20.333
Madame Jen.

32:20.833 --> 32:22.042
I thought she was a psychic.

32:22.625 --> 32:24.375
I thought she did sound baths for dogs.

32:24.458 --> 32:26.083
I thought she was a water sommelier.

32:26.167 --> 32:27.542
She did try to sell me knives.

32:27.625 --> 32:32.958
What? No, well, whatever she is,
we have to find her, but until then...

32:33.042 --> 32:34.333
"Until then" what?

32:34.417 --> 32:38.292
Last time we convinced everyone that
we were each other until we switched back.

32:38.375 --> 32:41.958
Brilliant. So how are we
supposed to pull that off?

32:42.042 --> 32:44.833
Well, panicking is not
going to help anyone!

32:44.917 --> 32:46.417
-I need you to get dressed.
-This sucks!

32:46.500 --> 32:48.542
-Go. Go get--
-No! Stop.

32:48.625 --> 32:50.500
-Bye, girls. It's going to be great.
-Mom, this really sucks.

32:50.583 --> 32:51.833
-Like the suckiest of suck.
-Look, Mom.

32:51.917 --> 32:53.833
I know I kept it totally together
in front of the girls,

32:53.917 --> 32:56.875
but I have to be honest,
I am freaking out right now!

32:56.958 --> 33:00.083
-That was you keeping it totally together?
-Yes!

33:00.167 --> 33:01.583
No, no. Just checking.

33:02.625 --> 33:05.792
Aura photographer.
Twenty percent off on her Etsy shop.

33:05.875 --> 33:08.458
I can't get married.
I haven't even had a boyfriend yet.

33:08.542 --> 33:10.292
We have to switch back to our bodies.

33:11.000 --> 33:14.750
At least your body
didn't wake up with arthritis.

33:14.833 --> 33:18.292
It's disconnected. I guess
her life coaching business went bust.

33:18.375 --> 33:20.042
I'm supposed to get married this weekend.

33:20.125 --> 33:24.208
What are these? And how many
puffer jackets does someone need?

33:24.292 --> 33:26.458
-Reiki master.
-What? What'd you find?

33:27.208 --> 33:31.167
I bent down and didn't toot.

33:32.250 --> 33:33.958
Youth really is wasted on the young.

33:34.042 --> 33:39.708
And what's with the old tissues
in every pocket? Explain.

33:40.708 --> 33:42.917
No answer at Reiki. Now what?

33:43.000 --> 33:44.542
Did you try her vegan meat loaf truck?

33:44.625 --> 33:46.750
They don't have a number,
and they only use DoorDash,

33:46.833 --> 33:48.042
and I don't know how to do that.

33:48.125 --> 33:51.500
I look Eileen Fisher years old.

33:52.625 --> 33:55.083
I'm literally my mother.

33:55.167 --> 33:57.458
I'm going to need therapy
for the rest of my life

33:57.542 --> 33:58.958
and not the kind from Grams.

33:59.042 --> 34:01.875
Like the real kind
that you have to pay for.

34:02.833 --> 34:04.375
Why does anyone wear these?

34:04.458 --> 34:06.500
Did she say anything, like a fortune?

34:06.583 --> 34:09.542
No, but maybe she told the girls.

34:09.625 --> 34:13.042
Did the psychic say anything
to you about a fortune?

34:13.125 --> 34:14.750
It could be the key
to getting out of this.

34:15.833 --> 34:17.000
-Wait, she did, right?
-She did.

34:17.083 --> 34:18.083
What was it?

34:18.167 --> 34:23.250
"Change the hearts you know are wrong
to reach the place where you belong."

34:24.000 --> 34:25.667
That's about our parents getting married.

34:25.750 --> 34:28.417
LA. London.

34:28.500 --> 34:31.458
As teenagers, we have no power.

34:31.542 --> 34:36.167
No say in whether we move or stay,
but as adults...

34:37.917 --> 34:39.625
Mom, she didn't say anything to us!

34:44.250 --> 34:47.250
Anna. Anna! You do not hit me.
I am your mother, young lady.

34:47.333 --> 34:49.792
-So, what do you say?
-Well, then...

34:49.875 --> 34:52.208
-It's not working!
-We need a plan.

34:52.292 --> 34:53.458
Not my fault!

34:54.208 --> 34:56.125
-DK doughnuts!
-She'll love those.

34:56.208 --> 34:57.292
-Harper, got 'em.
-I... I'll love them.

34:57.375 --> 35:00.208
-Anna loves doughnuts.
-Hey, girls. How was the sleepover?

35:00.292 --> 35:02.042
-Good.
-Very good.

35:02.125 --> 35:03.250
-We did teenager stuff.
-Very good.

35:05.542 --> 35:09.167
So here's our plan.
First, these clothes are rubbish.

35:09.250 --> 35:14.833
I just can't.
Can you just give me five minutes?

35:27.792 --> 35:29.000
-What?
-Oh, no.

35:29.083 --> 35:30.708
How? Why?

35:30.792 --> 35:34.292
You're in your mum's body,
so all you have to do is tell my dad

35:34.375 --> 35:36.167
you don't love him anymore.

35:36.250 --> 35:37.542
Wedding is off. Done.

35:38.583 --> 35:40.375
Got some bangs.

35:40.458 --> 35:42.625
-What did you do to my hair?
-I fixed it.

35:42.708 --> 35:45.375
-And you're welcome. It's called a fringe.
-Fixed it.

35:45.458 --> 35:47.667
You don't seriously think
you're going to my work dressed like this.

35:47.750 --> 35:48.875
Take that off.
You're going to get me fired.

35:48.958 --> 35:50.708
-What'd you do to my hair? Disgusting.
-I straightened it.

35:50.792 --> 35:54.208
-You never wash your hair.
-No, I don't. The ocean washes it for me.

35:54.292 --> 35:56.375
Obviously, the wedding can't happen.

35:56.458 --> 35:59.958
It's Friday. We only have till Sunday.
We gotta do some serious sabotage.

36:00.042 --> 36:02.542
The immigration interview,
the rehearsal lunch.

36:02.625 --> 36:06.417
Then what if we cancel
all the wedding stuff?

36:06.500 --> 36:08.500
The cake, place, people.

36:08.583 --> 36:12.875
Yes, and all we have to do is convince
our parents that they are incompatible.

36:12.958 --> 36:15.417
Which should not be hard
because my mom obviously

36:15.500 --> 36:17.792
should not be with some
wannabe Gordon Ramsay.

36:17.875 --> 36:20.292
Well, my father doesn't want to be

36:20.375 --> 36:24.583
with some wannabe
Valley Village rocker mom.

36:24.667 --> 36:27.292
I quite like this, sexy tiger.

36:27.375 --> 36:28.625
-Doughnut!
-It's...

36:28.708 --> 36:30.208
It's an American superstition

36:30.292 --> 36:33.417
that it's bad luck for the bride and groom
to kiss before they say I do so...

36:33.500 --> 36:35.333
Really? For how long?

36:35.417 --> 36:37.583
For a long time. A long, long time.

36:37.667 --> 36:40.542
-Really?
-Yeah. Also, no touching hands.

36:40.625 --> 36:42.042
No touching at all.

36:42.125 --> 36:46.042
No gazing into each other's eyes
because it's gross. Yeah.

36:46.125 --> 36:47.667
-How odd.
-For maximum luck.

36:47.750 --> 36:52.125
And finally, we must be convincing
as them until we break them up.

36:54.792 --> 36:55.792
Lily?

36:55.875 --> 36:56.917
-What?
-Yeah?

36:58.500 --> 37:00.333
Did you just take Tess's calcium?

37:08.250 --> 37:09.250
Bone health.

37:11.542 --> 37:14.375
-You need those. You need those.
-Yes, I'll be taking them.

37:14.458 --> 37:15.667
Okay.

37:15.750 --> 37:17.250
-You need to take those.
-Give me the doughnut back.

37:17.333 --> 37:19.083
-No. You can't. You're very diabetic.
-Okay, girls.

37:19.167 --> 37:20.500
Let's crack on.

37:22.750 --> 37:25.625
Well, actually, Lily and I
aren't feeling very well.

37:25.708 --> 37:26.708
We think it might be...

37:26.792 --> 37:29.125
-My throat.
-...a smart decision to stay home.

37:29.208 --> 37:32.083
This has nothing to do
with your detention?

37:34.042 --> 37:38.125
Well, you wouldn't want me to go
to school sick, would you, Mom?

37:40.417 --> 37:41.458
You don't feel sick to me.

37:42.417 --> 37:44.208
Does she look sick to you, Grams?
I mean, Mom?

37:45.625 --> 37:48.250
No. They look fine.

37:48.333 --> 37:51.458
You have your client, Ella's huge
Rolling Stone photo shoot today

37:51.542 --> 37:53.042
and your immigration interview.

37:53.125 --> 37:55.667
Don't you need a little bit
of help with that?

37:55.750 --> 37:57.583
Of course she needs your help.

37:58.542 --> 38:01.458
Right? Kids these days.
They'll say anything to get out of school.

38:01.542 --> 38:04.167
-All right, girls. Come on. Let's go.
-Go on. And make good choices.

38:04.250 --> 38:06.583
-See you at the dance studio!
-Bye! What?

38:06.667 --> 38:07.708
Dance studio?

38:08.792 --> 38:10.750
Let's go. Change at the club.
I've got your bag.

38:10.833 --> 38:11.833
Change?

38:11.917 --> 38:12.833
This is the finals.

38:12.917 --> 38:16.583
Welcome, everybody,
to the WestsidePickleball Championship.

38:17.125 --> 38:19.333
Yeah. You have your championship today.

38:20.583 --> 38:21.917
I think you're gonna be late.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.250
Late? Yes! Yeah, I'm gonna be late.

38:24.333 --> 38:30.292
Okay, newlyweds, you just made your
grand entrance into the wedding reception.

38:30.375 --> 38:34.458
The lights begin to dim.
And a five, six, seven, Eric.

38:35.875 --> 38:38.667
-Beth, no.
-Oh, right. Like a bull.

38:39.750 --> 38:40.875
Yes!

38:40.958 --> 38:43.792
-Charging. It's a bull. Yes.
-Stallion.

38:43.875 --> 38:46.208
Get it, groom. Big stallion energy.

38:46.292 --> 38:47.958
-Yes. It's a bull, though.
-All right.

38:48.042 --> 38:49.375
-So look at him.
-What?

38:49.458 --> 38:50.500
Eye contact, come on.

38:50.583 --> 38:51.958
-Hi. Yeah.
-Hi.

38:52.042 --> 38:54.417
Tango isyour pelvis.

38:54.500 --> 38:58.125
Pickleball. It's a sport like tennis
but it is pathetic.

38:58.208 --> 39:00.000
Tennis for lazy people, that's what it is.

39:00.083 --> 39:01.625
It's like tennis but for nonathletes.

39:01.708 --> 39:05.125
It's a bunch of old nutters
with giant paddles chasing a Wiffle ball.

39:05.208 --> 39:06.917
It's not bloody Wimbledon, is it?

39:07.833 --> 39:08.750
Here we go.

39:09.625 --> 39:12.500
-That's yours!
-Okay. That was so fast.

39:12.583 --> 39:14.042
That's so aggressive.

39:14.125 --> 39:15.875
-What was that?
-She almost hit me!

39:17.292 --> 39:18.292
Okay.

39:19.000 --> 39:20.542
-No. You're going down.
-Up. Up you go.

39:20.625 --> 39:22.333
-I think we should go up.
-No, it's okay. It's fine.

39:22.417 --> 39:23.500
This is good right here.

39:23.583 --> 39:25.000
You're just lying on the floor.

39:25.750 --> 39:29.333
Taking a little nappy-poo.
It's not a nappy-poo, it's tango.

39:29.417 --> 39:31.833
No. I'm just thinking that
maybe the tango isn't our dance.

39:32.583 --> 39:35.208
-Anything else?
-Okay, Beth, what else is sexy?

39:35.833 --> 39:37.500
Come on. Keep our head in the game.

39:38.500 --> 39:39.667
Game point, suckers.

39:53.083 --> 39:54.417
Drop it!

39:56.333 --> 39:59.292
Serena Williams, she's got nothing on
the sounds these ladies are making.

39:59.375 --> 40:02.125
The body-thumping beat of hip-hop.

40:02.208 --> 40:04.208
-Like that? Yep.
-Bop, bop, bop. Yes.

40:04.292 --> 40:05.625
A hop and a hip-hop.

40:05.708 --> 40:07.833
-I've never seen this kind of hip-hop.
-Hip-hop.

40:10.958 --> 40:12.208
-She's on the ground.
-How's she doing that?

40:12.292 --> 40:13.333
That's a new move.

40:13.417 --> 40:15.833
That's defensive offense.
Defensive offense!

40:16.625 --> 40:17.542
Woman, get up!

40:21.833 --> 40:23.542
-That was close!
-Wow! Did you see that?

40:23.625 --> 40:24.708
Did you see that?

40:26.875 --> 40:27.875
Did we win?

40:27.958 --> 40:29.708
Yes! Yes!

40:32.458 --> 40:34.250
-We won!
-I believe that that was illegal

40:34.333 --> 40:36.958
and I'd like to roll back the tapes
and watch that one more time.

40:37.042 --> 40:38.417
Take that, boomers!

40:38.500 --> 40:40.125
-Okay. You know what, no.
-Okay, first of all--

40:40.208 --> 40:41.375
-Hold me back.
-You stay back.

40:41.458 --> 40:43.042
-We are not boomers.
-We're Gen X!

40:43.125 --> 40:46.333
-We are elder millennials.
-Some of the last millennials.

40:46.417 --> 40:47.833
-The finale.
-The finale.

40:48.417 --> 40:50.958
And five, six, seven, eight.

40:51.042 --> 40:53.667
Go! And slide. That's it.

40:56.458 --> 40:57.833
Get it.

40:57.917 --> 40:59.250
To the side.

40:59.333 --> 41:00.958
Get it. Yes!

41:11.792 --> 41:13.708
And Anna.

41:13.792 --> 41:14.875
-Run, girl.
-Run!

41:14.958 --> 41:16.292
Anna.

41:16.375 --> 41:17.833
-Come on, let's go.
-Run!

41:17.917 --> 41:20.583
-Get it. Run. Run.
-Run.

41:22.208 --> 41:23.292
Anna.

41:25.667 --> 41:28.042
-We're supposed to know where to go.
-Look natural, honey.

41:28.125 --> 41:29.583
-Detention's that way.
-Can you tell me--

41:29.667 --> 41:30.667
Okay.

41:39.542 --> 41:42.833
I have an immigration interview,
a rehearsal lunch,

41:42.917 --> 41:47.375
Ella’s big show, my wedding,
and I am stuck in detention!

41:47.458 --> 41:48.833
Well, I'm stuck here too.

41:48.917 --> 41:52.333
And it's the championships
for the entire Westside.

41:53.042 --> 41:56.125
Well, well, well. Look who showed up.

41:56.875 --> 42:00.083
Lily Reyes and Harper Coleman.

42:00.792 --> 42:03.000
How have you not retired yet?

42:03.083 --> 42:06.167
The school had our pension
invested in crypto

42:06.667 --> 42:08.583
but since I'm not supposed
to complain about it,

42:08.667 --> 42:11.292
per my lawyer,
it's neither here nor there.

42:11.792 --> 42:14.250
So let's surrender our devices. Let's go.

42:15.000 --> 42:18.500
-Mr. Bates, really? Come on.
-We just got our phones back.

42:18.583 --> 42:20.792
-That's right. We love school, everybody.
-Here.

42:21.292 --> 42:22.542
Thank you, Simon.

42:23.583 --> 42:27.208
And now it's time to prepare
for the most boring task

42:27.292 --> 42:29.500
you could ever possibly imagine.

42:29.583 --> 42:33.333
Sit there, read or think only.

42:33.833 --> 42:36.500
No screens, books.

42:37.917 --> 42:38.917
Wait.

42:39.625 --> 42:42.833
Does he mean hours of uninterrupted peace?

42:42.917 --> 42:45.417
Wipe that look of bliss off your face.

42:45.500 --> 42:47.375
Get over yourself, Elton.

42:47.458 --> 42:49.042
This is high school, not prison.

42:49.125 --> 42:50.792
Yeah, it's not a prison.

42:50.875 --> 42:54.542
Which, FYI, research shows
is ineffective at preventing recidivism.

42:54.625 --> 42:56.125
Yeah, "resisism."

42:56.208 --> 42:58.708
You know, giving back to the community
is a lot more effective

42:58.792 --> 43:00.625
than trapping people inside.

43:04.167 --> 43:05.792
You wanna go outside?

43:06.750 --> 43:07.917
Let us out.

43:08.000 --> 43:09.958
Yeah, let us out.

43:10.042 --> 43:12.250
Let us out. Let us out.

43:12.333 --> 43:16.125
-Let us out. Let us out. Let us out.
-Outside.

43:16.667 --> 43:19.208
Move it! Let's pick it up!

43:19.292 --> 43:20.583
Out of the way!

43:20.667 --> 43:22.750
We need to find Madame Jen, now.

43:22.833 --> 43:24.167
We need our phones.

43:24.875 --> 43:27.292
Come on, Reyes! You run like my grandma.

43:28.333 --> 43:29.625
-Pick it up.
-Rude!

43:29.708 --> 43:32.167
Pick up the pace or you'll pick up trash.

43:32.250 --> 43:33.250
It's in two days.

43:33.333 --> 43:35.125
Yeah, I know.
I don't care about the deposit.

43:35.208 --> 43:36.958
-And the officiant?
-That includes the officiant too?

43:37.042 --> 43:38.500
Cancel that, too. Thank you.

43:38.583 --> 43:41.417
-Call from Jett. Answer it?
-Is this for real? Yes.

43:41.500 --> 43:43.958
Where are you?
The editor from Rolling Stone is here.

43:44.042 --> 43:46.208
-Come on! Hurry up!
-Oh, no.

43:46.292 --> 43:48.542
Remember, it's the Hungry Tour.

43:48.625 --> 43:50.625
Trevor's allergic to strawberries.

43:50.708 --> 43:51.958
Look sweet, Ella.

43:53.417 --> 43:55.417
-Ella's having a meltdown.
-Morning, Anna.

43:55.500 --> 43:58.833
Hello, my staff of people
that I see all the time.

43:58.917 --> 44:00.417
Can you sign off on the dress?

44:01.292 --> 44:02.458
-Perfect.
-Here's your juice.

44:02.542 --> 44:03.542
Thank you.

44:04.250 --> 44:06.125
All right, so she's over here by this...

44:07.292 --> 44:08.292
Girl, what?

44:08.792 --> 44:11.542
-Why would you give me that to drink?
-You yell at me if I don't.

44:11.625 --> 44:15.333
Anna. Jean shorts, rash guard.
Laundry day?

44:17.125 --> 44:19.542
Let's talk about the headline
for the article.

44:19.625 --> 44:24.250
"It's giving It-Girl. Pop star queen Ella
slays down the house."

44:24.333 --> 44:26.042
-Wait, what?
-Or,

44:26.125 --> 44:30.167
"We're gagging, besties.
Ella's new album just hits different."

44:30.250 --> 44:31.458
No, no. Just stop.

44:31.542 --> 44:34.167
What deeply out-of-touch old person
came up with those?

44:34.708 --> 44:37.208
-You did.
-I did? Wow.

44:37.292 --> 44:38.292
Thanks, puss.

44:38.375 --> 44:40.250
Okay, I really need you to focus on Ella--

44:40.333 --> 44:41.333
Okay.

44:45.958 --> 44:46.958
Do something.

44:49.083 --> 44:50.083
Ella?

44:50.917 --> 44:53.958
Trevor unfollowed me.
And you know what that means?

44:54.833 --> 44:56.125
No.

44:56.208 --> 45:03.000
What it means is that
the whole world knows that he dumped me.

45:03.083 --> 45:04.917
It's everywhere!

45:05.667 --> 45:09.167
Okay. I am your manager,
so I'm gonna manage this.

45:09.250 --> 45:10.167
Okay.

45:10.250 --> 45:12.625
Ryan, I really do need to dash.

45:12.708 --> 45:14.708
Yeah, but they said
the photographer's back in five minutes.

45:14.792 --> 45:16.167
Photographer?

45:16.250 --> 45:17.458
Yeah.

45:17.542 --> 45:18.833
For your new passport photo.

45:18.917 --> 45:21.500
The one you need for the international
part of your book tour?

45:21.583 --> 45:22.667
Yes.

45:22.750 --> 45:27.167
I remember every detail
that you told me about me.

45:27.250 --> 45:30.458
Yeah. I got prescriptions,
you got the essentials.

45:32.000 --> 45:33.042
Essentials?

45:37.625 --> 45:38.958
Yes.

45:45.750 --> 45:47.500
Do I need all these things?

45:56.458 --> 45:58.292
I need that. Yes.

45:59.917 --> 46:01.458
Where does this go?

46:08.500 --> 46:11.750
What? Adult nappies?

46:11.833 --> 46:13.750
That is so lazy.

46:15.375 --> 46:17.292
-Oh, hey.
-Yes. Right here.

46:20.417 --> 46:21.792
-Fixodent?
-Yes.

46:21.875 --> 46:23.750
Isn't that toothpaste for old people?

46:24.292 --> 46:26.750
No. This is for when you lose your teeth.

46:31.250 --> 46:32.958
I'm gonna lose my teeth?

46:34.250 --> 46:35.250
No!

46:35.333 --> 46:36.958
Okay, slowpokes.

46:37.042 --> 46:40.500
I want every blue spirulina
smoothie spill gone.

46:40.583 --> 46:42.625
I want every chia seed scraped.

46:42.708 --> 46:46.542
Every chewed piece of organic gum
on the bottoms of these seats gone!

46:46.625 --> 46:49.000
-Way to go, Harper.
-Use your nails if you have to.

46:49.083 --> 46:52.042
What? No, this was Lily's fault.

46:52.125 --> 46:53.125
Elton.

46:54.542 --> 46:55.542
Yeah?

46:55.625 --> 46:58.958
I understand that
you feel the need to prove a point

46:59.042 --> 47:01.750
because I publicly undermined
your authority.

47:04.375 --> 47:06.375
Do you understand me?

47:06.458 --> 47:09.208
This isn't restorative justice.
I mean, if anything,

47:09.292 --> 47:11.667
you're making these kids
want to act out more.

47:11.750 --> 47:14.458
How does Lily always manage
to make things worse?

47:14.542 --> 47:15.708
It's a unique talent.

47:15.792 --> 47:17.875
I have connections
on the school board, Elton.

47:17.958 --> 47:21.417
Well, you're a stupid kid
and you have no connections,

47:21.500 --> 47:25.583
but you have earned,
along with everybody here,

47:25.667 --> 47:27.250
three more weeks of detention.

47:27.333 --> 47:29.625
-Oh, my...
-Lily!

47:29.708 --> 47:31.542
-Bro!
-Your royal highness.

47:32.625 --> 47:34.083
-Come on!
-My God!

47:34.167 --> 47:35.708
That was uncalled for.

47:35.792 --> 47:39.875
Let's all take a deep, centering breath.

47:41.708 --> 47:44.458
-Meditate on this!
-Take a deep breath of this trash!

47:44.542 --> 47:45.542
You ready?

47:46.417 --> 47:47.417
Stunning.

47:48.458 --> 47:49.708
Wow.

47:49.792 --> 47:50.792
Good, right?

47:52.542 --> 47:54.958
I think you're having
an allergic reaction.

47:55.042 --> 47:57.375
No, no, no, no. It's lip plumper.

47:58.167 --> 47:59.250
I'm gonna get some ice.

47:59.333 --> 48:00.667
Okay, give me the ring light.

48:00.750 --> 48:02.917
And every bottle of Benadryl I can find.

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
It's lip plumper. No, Ryan.

48:05.083 --> 48:06.958
I don't have allergies.

48:07.042 --> 48:09.500
Okay, whatever.
Do you have another ring light?

48:09.583 --> 48:11.208
-Like, a big ring light?
-Sure.

48:11.292 --> 48:13.333
-And another thing. Can you make that...
-Yeah, okay.

48:13.417 --> 48:15.792
Wait, you hold the ring light. I'll pose.
Okay, ready?

48:15.875 --> 48:16.875
I got it.

48:21.083 --> 48:22.458
Let me look. Hold on.

48:23.750 --> 48:27.167
Oh, no. Just ten, maybe 15 more.

48:27.250 --> 48:30.083
I'll give you looks, okay?
All right, here I go.

48:33.042 --> 48:37.292
"Dear Sir, must cancel the wedding venue
because the bride is horrible,

48:37.375 --> 48:39.292
as my daughter always suspected."

48:40.625 --> 48:41.750
Who's Laura?

48:41.833 --> 48:42.875
Hello, hello.

48:42.958 --> 48:45.750
Hey, hon. I need your approval
on the author photo.

48:45.833 --> 48:47.625
-Okay.
-Texting it over now.

48:48.583 --> 48:51.375
Oh, no. No, no.

48:51.458 --> 48:52.875
That one's rubbish.

48:52.958 --> 48:56.875
-I just took a new one. I'm sending now.
-Thanks.

48:56.958 --> 49:00.917
Oh, look. Her phone has
the giant letter virus.

49:03.875 --> 49:07.417
Ryan. Is it possible for you
to drop me at Anna's work?

49:07.500 --> 49:08.875
Hey, you Trevorheads.

49:08.958 --> 49:11.708
That was your boy, Trevor Travis,
with his brand-new song,

49:11.792 --> 49:12.917
"Better than the Last One."

49:14.083 --> 49:15.917
My mom's biggest client
is having a meltdown.

49:16.000 --> 49:17.208
-Jett!
-I'm working!

49:17.292 --> 49:19.250
Trevor, her boyfriend, dumped her.

49:20.750 --> 49:21.750
Trevor Travis?

49:31.583 --> 49:34.458
And they just got matching tattoos.

49:34.542 --> 49:38.875
That is literally the worst thing

49:38.958 --> 49:42.250
I have ever heard happening
to anyone ever, full stop.

49:42.333 --> 49:44.083
-Thank you.
-Of course.

49:44.792 --> 49:46.250
Anna's getting married,

49:46.333 --> 49:48.917
so she doesn't get what it's like
to have your heart broken.

49:49.000 --> 49:51.333
I know. When I was your age, my mom--

49:51.417 --> 49:54.208
I mean, I had this boyfriend, Jake,

49:54.292 --> 49:56.667
and all my friends say
he was my first love.

49:56.750 --> 49:58.458
Is that who your song's about?

49:59.000 --> 50:00.417
What song? My song?

50:14.542 --> 50:15.667
I wrote that?

50:16.625 --> 50:18.292
It's really good.

50:19.417 --> 50:21.917
This is a great song.

50:22.000 --> 50:24.167
You're really good.

50:24.750 --> 50:26.417
I don't get why you quit playing.

50:27.958 --> 50:33.458
Because I had a kid who I probably resent
since I'm writing songs in secret.

50:33.542 --> 50:35.042
So, you miss performing?

50:37.083 --> 50:39.458
I mean, yeah, probably.

50:40.042 --> 50:42.125
I'm finding out a lot about myself today.

50:45.333 --> 50:50.667
Anna, your song is the only song I loved
out of everything that we got sent.

50:50.750 --> 50:52.500
I know you already said no,

50:52.583 --> 50:56.667
but can I please sing it
at the Wiltern tomorrow?

50:56.750 --> 51:01.042
I mean, it's your concert, your tour.
You should sing whatever song you want.

51:02.000 --> 51:03.625
Okay. Yeah, just--

51:03.708 --> 51:08.917
I feel like between managers and stylists
and execs and label people,

51:09.000 --> 51:12.583
I feel like I never get a say
in anything that goes on.

51:12.667 --> 51:13.750
Right?

51:14.250 --> 51:17.542
Right, because old people never listen.

51:18.583 --> 51:20.917
I mean, people like you think--

51:21.000 --> 51:23.708
I think people like me think
people like you don't know any--

51:23.792 --> 51:26.042
-You know what I mean.
-Yeah.

51:26.125 --> 51:28.042
I have control over my own life.

51:29.000 --> 51:31.125
Absolute control. Photoshoot's back on.

51:31.208 --> 51:33.125
Photoshoot is back on, grasshoppers.

51:33.208 --> 51:34.667
Chop, chop, chop.

51:34.750 --> 51:39.875
Let's make some fierce photos
of this fierce girl right here.

51:39.958 --> 51:41.667
Bruh, having a job is really hard.

51:41.750 --> 51:43.667
-Wait.
-What? "Wait" what?

51:43.750 --> 51:47.667
If your mum wrote that song
about that Jake...

51:47.750 --> 51:48.583
Yeah.

51:48.667 --> 51:51.125
...that's how we can get our parents
to split up forever.

51:51.208 --> 51:54.542
So if she is with him,
she can't marry my dad.

51:54.625 --> 51:55.792
Well, how do we find him?

51:57.833 --> 52:00.833
It's like a database of old people.

52:00.917 --> 52:03.250
-Jake. Yes.
-That's him from the photo.

52:03.333 --> 52:04.708
Wait, wait, wait, look.

52:05.792 --> 52:06.708
Okay.

52:06.792 --> 52:08.750
And he owns the Record Parlour.

52:08.833 --> 52:11.875
He has liked all your mom's posts.

52:11.958 --> 52:14.667
He is proper obsessed with her.

52:14.750 --> 52:16.625
Single. Okay, let's do it.

52:16.708 --> 52:18.375
Let's do it.

52:19.000 --> 52:21.417
But first, your mum must look fit

52:21.500 --> 52:23.417
if she's gonna run into
the love of her life.

52:23.500 --> 52:25.125
And I need to change, too.

52:25.208 --> 52:28.833
Ella's stylist has pulled
the most gorgeous garms

52:28.917 --> 52:31.417
-I've ever seen in my entire life.
-Do we love this for me?

52:31.500 --> 52:32.875
Girl, the label loves this for you.

52:32.958 --> 52:34.375
-Can we just put it on your--
-No.

52:34.458 --> 52:35.667
-Maybe on your shoulder?
-No.

52:35.750 --> 52:36.750
Rest it on your head?

52:36.833 --> 52:39.833
Please, can we just
put our differences aside

52:39.917 --> 52:42.542
so that I can live my dream? Please.

52:42.625 --> 52:44.500
This is only because of the plan.

52:44.583 --> 52:46.042
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

52:47.875 --> 52:50.125
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

53:00.667 --> 53:02.083
It's not very me.

53:02.750 --> 53:05.333
Harper. This is so exciting.

53:05.417 --> 53:07.625
So, posing for the camera,
it's very different.

53:07.708 --> 53:09.625
Find a shape and then hold it.

53:09.708 --> 53:11.125
-Yeah. Okay.
-Good luck.

53:14.250 --> 53:15.875
-I'm sorry, where did the fruit go?
-I'm s--

53:21.417 --> 53:24.292
-This is cool. It's recycled I think.
-That is chic.

53:25.500 --> 53:27.375
-Well, 'cause I'm a pop star. Pop out.
-Yeah.

53:27.958 --> 53:28.958
Pop.

53:29.583 --> 53:30.583
No! No! No! No!

53:32.083 --> 53:33.833
No, no, no.

53:44.625 --> 53:46.708
Tess, your styling is so on point.

53:46.792 --> 53:49.042
You two are the coolest adults
I have ever met.

53:49.125 --> 53:49.958
Thanks.

53:50.042 --> 53:51.333
-Bye.
-Thank you.

53:51.417 --> 53:53.000
-My mom does have a cool job.
-Yes.

53:57.083 --> 53:58.542
Think she's our new best friend?

53:58.625 --> 54:01.125
I think so. I think so.

54:01.667 --> 54:02.833
Do you guys need a ride?

54:03.417 --> 54:05.542
-Yes. Totally. Yes.
-OMG, yes.

54:06.333 --> 54:07.792
Attention, students.

54:07.875 --> 54:11.875
You'll be happy to know that
my anaphylactic shock has subsided.

54:15.625 --> 54:17.375
Yes. I didn't die.

54:19.417 --> 54:20.417
Thank you.

54:23.792 --> 54:28.208
And I hope those who were involved
in that food fight are loving detention.

54:39.125 --> 54:40.125
Oh, no.

54:41.708 --> 54:43.792
They've gone completely rogue.

54:45.542 --> 54:48.250
-Yeah!
-This is so cool!

54:48.333 --> 54:50.125
What are we wearing?

54:50.208 --> 54:53.875
They're on a joyride with Ella.
We'll never find them.

54:53.958 --> 54:57.708
No, but we can find Madame Jen.

55:02.000 --> 55:03.792
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

55:04.917 --> 55:05.917
Oh, yeah.

55:11.208 --> 55:14.292
Madame Jen said she lost her table
at the Larchmont Farmers Market,

55:14.375 --> 55:17.167
but now she can be seen
at the Starbucks across the street

55:17.250 --> 55:20.042
from the Larchmont Village
wine and cheese shop.

55:22.833 --> 55:24.083
Look, I know we don't have time...

55:24.167 --> 55:25.167
But we are here.

55:25.250 --> 55:27.917
And my metabolism is the speed of sound.

55:30.625 --> 55:32.500
I got extra whipped cream!

55:32.583 --> 55:34.875
My knees work!

55:34.958 --> 55:37.583
I haven't had real dairy
since Bush was president.

55:37.667 --> 55:38.833
Curly fries!

55:38.917 --> 55:40.583
Flexibility!

55:44.167 --> 55:46.667
We really need to find Madame Jen.

55:46.750 --> 55:50.375
Yes, but they have onion rings
on their burgers.

55:50.958 --> 55:53.667
I haven't digested like this in decades!

55:53.750 --> 55:55.375
I'm still not full!

55:56.167 --> 55:57.083
Sugar.

55:57.875 --> 55:59.375
Remember sugar?

55:59.458 --> 56:01.250
But after this, back to the mission.

56:01.333 --> 56:03.042
It has my full attention.

56:03.125 --> 56:07.125
All you have to do is go in there
and flirt with Jake,

56:07.208 --> 56:09.750
and remind him why he fancied you
when you were young.

56:09.833 --> 56:11.208
Wait, I wasn't me when I was young.

56:11.292 --> 56:12.458
And I don't know how to flirt.

56:12.542 --> 56:15.167
And I definitely don't know
how to flirt as an old person.

56:15.250 --> 56:18.042
What do they do,
talk about transitional lenses?

56:18.125 --> 56:20.458
Home repairs? John Mayer?

56:20.542 --> 56:22.250
-I don't know.
-I have an idea.

56:22.333 --> 56:24.292
We both wear our AirPods.

56:24.375 --> 56:26.750
That way you can help me
because you have a French boyfriend.

56:26.833 --> 56:28.750
So you definitely know how to flirt.

56:30.000 --> 56:32.917
Yeah... Defo. Yes.

56:33.000 --> 56:34.917
I'm gonna go in,
and then I'll give you the word

56:35.000 --> 56:37.208
when to come in and make
your sexy grand entrance.

56:38.208 --> 56:40.042
What sexy grand entrance?
What do you mean?

56:40.125 --> 56:41.125
You have to be sexy.

56:41.208 --> 56:42.208
-How?
-Like...

56:43.833 --> 56:44.833
Sexy.

56:45.750 --> 56:46.875
I'm not doing that.

57:26.750 --> 57:27.750
Hey!

57:30.708 --> 57:33.458
-This is a different look.
-Yeah. Uh-huh.

57:33.542 --> 57:35.917
It's awesome.
I didn't know you were coming by today.

57:36.000 --> 57:37.667
-I got the stuff in the back.
-What stuff?

57:37.750 --> 57:38.917
What do you mean?

57:39.417 --> 57:42.792
That's him. That's her bloke.
What's happening?

57:43.792 --> 57:45.458
He's going to get me stuff.

57:45.542 --> 57:48.458
What is your mother doing
behind my father's back?

57:49.375 --> 57:51.250
No. Hey, hey, hey!

57:51.333 --> 57:53.042
-Do not shush me. Okay?
-Get down.

57:53.125 --> 57:55.083
-He can't hear me.
-Get down. I'm ignoring you.

57:55.167 --> 57:57.083
Hey, thanks again for doing this.

57:57.167 --> 58:00.667
What exactly are we doing here?

58:01.417 --> 58:03.167
Signing the merch for the charity auction.

58:04.708 --> 58:06.375
-Right.
-Here you go.

58:06.958 --> 58:09.875
Right. The merch.

58:15.667 --> 58:16.958
I have a question.

58:17.833 --> 58:19.167
Do you ever think about me?

58:19.250 --> 58:20.833
About us?

58:21.458 --> 58:23.750
I'm not sure there's a right answer
to this question.

58:23.833 --> 58:29.667
I mean, do you ever miss us?

58:31.583 --> 58:33.458
You're getting married this weekend.

58:34.333 --> 58:37.333
Unless I'm not.

58:39.417 --> 58:40.792
Okay, very good.

58:40.875 --> 58:42.083
Now, do something cheeky.

58:42.167 --> 58:43.667
Like, flip your hair.

58:44.667 --> 58:45.667
Good.

58:46.167 --> 58:51.083
Good. Big, big, big moves. Big moves.
One more. Shake your head. Shake it.

58:52.083 --> 58:55.458
More. Like, all the way around.
Very good. Shake it.

58:56.667 --> 58:57.833
Excellent.

58:57.917 --> 59:01.208
Okay, wink at him. Try winking. Wink.

59:01.292 --> 59:02.458
Wink.

59:02.542 --> 59:04.667
Wink. One eye. One eye.

59:04.750 --> 59:05.917
Now do both.

59:06.542 --> 59:09.125
Wink. Okay, good.

59:11.750 --> 59:13.750
Okay. That's not working.

59:15.542 --> 59:17.625
Bite your lip. Bite your lip.

59:19.750 --> 59:21.625
Why is he looking at you like that?

59:22.208 --> 59:23.375
I'm biting my lip.

59:23.917 --> 59:27.625
No, not your top lip. Your bottom lip.
Bite your bottom lip.

59:27.708 --> 59:29.208
Like that, pouty.

59:30.208 --> 59:31.667
I know what this is.

59:31.750 --> 59:33.458
I've seen this before.
You're having a stroke.

59:33.542 --> 59:34.958
-We need to get you help.
-No, no.

59:35.042 --> 59:36.750
I just need to go to the bathroom.

59:36.833 --> 59:38.208
I just... Yeah. Gotta go to the bathroom.

59:38.292 --> 59:40.375
-It's in the back.
-All right. I'll find it.

59:40.458 --> 59:42.042
Are you sure? I...

59:47.792 --> 59:48.917
There's no merch in the--

59:49.708 --> 59:51.958
I was really bad at that. So bad at that.

59:52.542 --> 59:54.458
How do you know your boyfriend liked you?

59:56.042 --> 59:57.167
You just know.

59:58.292 --> 01:00:00.208
How? Like, specifically.

01:00:00.292 --> 01:00:03.000
You've dated a guy. You know this.
You have experience.

01:00:03.083 --> 01:00:04.417
Tell me. Help me out here.

01:00:07.333 --> 01:00:09.625
Harper, I don't have a French boyfriend.

01:00:12.208 --> 01:00:16.833
My entire dating experience is
watching 500 hours of Love Island.

01:00:16.917 --> 01:00:19.042
Wait, you're, like,
the most confident person I know.

01:00:19.125 --> 01:00:20.542
It's an act.

01:00:24.250 --> 01:00:25.250
What?

01:00:25.333 --> 01:00:27.250
Well, you're not gonna
tell everyone, are you?

01:00:28.125 --> 01:00:30.917
No. I'm not like that. I wouldn't do that.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.417
Okay. Thank you.

01:00:33.333 --> 01:00:36.292
-You're not gonna hug me, are you?
-No, I was... Just...

01:00:36.375 --> 01:00:38.250
-No, don't do that.
-Okay, it was just...

01:00:38.333 --> 01:00:40.625
All right, look, no, we should
get back out there. Right?

01:00:40.708 --> 01:00:43.333
Because, otherwise,
he'll think I'm pooping.

01:00:43.417 --> 01:00:45.167
-There she is!
-I see her. Right by the milk.

01:00:45.250 --> 01:00:47.792
And I see
your screenwriting career taking off.

01:00:47.875 --> 01:00:50.333
If you move over to...

01:00:50.417 --> 01:00:52.833
-Genre?
-Genre, yes.

01:00:52.917 --> 01:00:53.833
Genre.

01:00:53.917 --> 01:00:55.042
Elevated genre?

01:00:56.667 --> 01:00:58.417
No. Sorry.

01:00:58.500 --> 01:00:59.500
You!

01:01:01.750 --> 01:01:02.750
How can I help?

01:01:02.833 --> 01:01:06.042
Take one wild guess.

01:01:06.125 --> 01:01:07.917
Are you gonna serve me papers?

01:01:09.125 --> 01:01:11.208
We switched bodies.

01:01:13.333 --> 01:01:14.500
Oh, my gosh.

01:01:15.208 --> 01:01:16.750
It actually worked.

01:01:17.500 --> 01:01:19.125
That's amazing.

01:01:19.208 --> 01:01:20.750
It's never worked before.

01:01:21.458 --> 01:01:24.125
Would you guys mind leaving
me a review or, like, five stars?

01:01:24.208 --> 01:01:26.917
And just saying, like, "Oh, my gosh!
Madame Jen was so much fun..."

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:28.750
Tell us how to switch back right now.

01:01:28.833 --> 01:01:29.833
Okay. All right.

01:01:29.917 --> 01:01:36.375
I'll consider it if you sign up for
my Reiki and financial management package.

01:01:36.458 --> 01:01:39.375
Tell us how to switch back,
you multi-hyphenate lunatic!

01:01:40.167 --> 01:01:42.958
Oh, my gosh. I am a multi-hyphenate.

01:01:43.042 --> 01:01:44.667
That absolutely slays.

01:01:44.750 --> 01:01:48.333
-I'm supposed to get married in two days.
-Right, okay.

01:01:49.958 --> 01:01:53.000
All right.
Well, you have to look at the reading.

01:01:53.083 --> 01:01:56.500
-That's the only way.
-We don't know the reading.

01:01:57.875 --> 01:01:59.333
What are you talking about?

01:01:59.417 --> 01:02:03.917
I said the reading directly to you both,
multiple times, in a scary whisper voice.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:05.458
Because we weren't there.

01:02:06.375 --> 01:02:07.375
That wasn't...

01:02:07.458 --> 01:02:09.375
Right! Oh, right.

01:02:09.458 --> 01:02:14.917
You weren't you because you had switched
with the other women, who are...

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:16.250
Okay, that's...

01:02:16.333 --> 01:02:17.833
And it makes sense.

01:02:18.708 --> 01:02:22.333
Okay. Well, the reading was,

01:02:22.417 --> 01:02:27.542
"Change the hearts you know are wrong
to reach the place where you belong."

01:02:27.625 --> 01:02:29.333
-Didn't we try that?
-I think we tried that.

01:02:29.417 --> 01:02:31.708
-We tried it.
-Okay, the problem is

01:02:31.792 --> 01:02:35.667
your hearts might not be
the only ones that need changing.

01:02:35.750 --> 01:02:36.792
So...

01:02:38.292 --> 01:02:39.292
Cute.

01:02:40.542 --> 01:02:42.417
Well, our time is up.

01:02:43.125 --> 01:02:44.167
Wait, but... No, no, no.

01:02:44.250 --> 01:02:46.458
There's got to be something else
you can do, right?

01:02:46.542 --> 01:02:48.958
I wish I could help you,
but my shift is starting.

01:02:49.875 --> 01:02:56.083
So, what I can do for you
is get you a cortado, an Americano, a...

01:02:58.083 --> 01:03:01.417
and any kind of
espresso or non-espresso drink.

01:03:02.542 --> 01:03:04.417
It's your dad! Shoot! Shoot! Shoot!

01:03:04.500 --> 01:03:06.833
This is all new inventory
that we need to get sorted.

01:03:08.250 --> 01:03:09.417
Excuse me.

01:03:10.917 --> 01:03:12.000
Tess?

01:03:15.583 --> 01:03:17.167
What are you doing down there?

01:03:18.458 --> 01:03:19.667
Stretching.

01:03:21.917 --> 01:03:23.167
Yeah. I...

01:03:23.792 --> 01:03:24.792
Anna didn't...

01:03:24.875 --> 01:03:27.167
She didn't tell me
that you were gonna be here today.

01:03:27.792 --> 01:03:30.250
What interview?
I mean, yes, I know the interview. Now?

01:03:30.333 --> 01:03:32.708
I was just thinking
about you the other day.

01:03:32.792 --> 01:03:34.083
Really?

01:03:34.708 --> 01:03:36.958
-I've been meaning to ask you something.
-Sure.

01:03:37.042 --> 01:03:42.958
And I don't quite know
how to broach the subject.

01:03:43.042 --> 01:03:48.833
But is your husband...
Is he still with us?

01:03:49.500 --> 01:03:53.250
Yeah. I can't believe it.
I mean, he's so old.

01:03:53.333 --> 01:03:55.833
How old is he?

01:03:55.917 --> 01:03:57.917
We never talk about it.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.167
Somewhere between 50 and 100.

01:04:01.792 --> 01:04:02.917
Really.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:07.292
Yeah. Yeah. But...
Okay, let me focus for a second.

01:04:07.375 --> 01:04:09.792
I'm worried about Anna, all right?

01:04:09.875 --> 01:04:11.292
She's been being weird with me,

01:04:11.375 --> 01:04:14.500
and she keeps asking
if I ever think about her.

01:04:14.583 --> 01:04:17.292
You know, maybe she is reconsidering.

01:04:17.375 --> 01:04:19.458
-Reconsidering?
-Uh-huh.

01:04:19.542 --> 01:04:22.875
Three weeks ago,
she told me how in love she is with Eric.

01:04:22.958 --> 01:04:25.458
Do you know
that she wrote a song about you?

01:04:26.958 --> 01:04:28.083
-No.
-Anna!

01:04:29.417 --> 01:04:33.875
Daughter. Why don't you tell Jake
about the song you wrote?

01:04:34.583 --> 01:04:35.917
I wrote a song about us.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.583
You know what, I'll give you your privacy.

01:04:37.667 --> 01:04:40.083
I'm just gonna go look for music
for old people.

01:04:40.167 --> 01:04:42.583
You know, really old, like Coldplay.

01:04:43.375 --> 01:04:45.167
It's nice to hear you're writing again.

01:04:45.250 --> 01:04:48.750
Yeah, can you just give me a second, bro?
Just one second.

01:04:49.583 --> 01:04:51.417
Coldplay...

01:04:51.500 --> 01:04:53.667
We need to get to
the immigration interview. Now.

01:04:53.750 --> 01:04:55.375
-Okay, let's go.
-Yeah.

01:04:56.792 --> 01:04:59.667
My legs are so weak,
my knees are cracking like walnuts.

01:05:05.375 --> 01:05:06.875
What is happening right now?

01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:12.708
My brain is telling my body to stand up,
but it's like shouting into the abyss.

01:05:14.458 --> 01:05:17.125
-See? I just tried to get up again.
-Okay.

01:05:17.208 --> 01:05:19.000
-Help me. Help me up.
-Okay.

01:05:19.083 --> 01:05:20.875
We have to find a way to
get to the immigration interview.

01:05:20.958 --> 01:05:21.833
-Okay, okay.
-Yes.

01:05:21.917 --> 01:05:24.750
Wait, I have an idea. Come on.

01:05:24.833 --> 01:05:26.417
So, that's why
Tess and I have a special bond.

01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:29.750
Jake. Hi. Could we borrow your car?

01:05:29.833 --> 01:05:33.542
And don't worry,
we're totally of age to drive.

01:05:33.625 --> 01:05:36.208
Anything for you, Dr. C.

01:05:38.708 --> 01:05:39.625
You ready?

01:05:40.583 --> 01:05:41.875
Hold on.

01:05:48.667 --> 01:05:50.083
That's a woman after my heart.

01:05:51.042 --> 01:05:52.583
-I love driving!
-I don't wanna--

01:05:52.667 --> 01:05:56.583
I don't know who taught you
how to drive but they weren't good.

01:06:00.125 --> 01:06:02.042
Wrong side! Wrong side! Wrong side!

01:06:02.792 --> 01:06:05.167
-Okay.
-You're gonna get us killed!

01:06:05.792 --> 01:06:06.917
Oh, geez.

01:06:11.083 --> 01:06:12.333
I can't look. I can't look.

01:06:12.958 --> 01:06:14.375
You know, I'm a very good driver.

01:06:29.167 --> 01:06:31.250
That was smashing.

01:06:44.458 --> 01:06:45.292
Hi.

01:06:45.875 --> 01:06:48.208
Hi. Nice car.

01:06:48.292 --> 01:06:49.542
It's totally mine.

01:06:49.625 --> 01:06:51.708
-You think he's cute.
-I do not.

01:06:51.792 --> 01:06:53.375
-You totally do.
-Stop. I do not.

01:06:53.458 --> 01:06:55.542
-Yes, you do. You absolutely do.
-I do not. Shut up.

01:06:55.625 --> 01:06:57.333
-She thinks you're cute!
-I do not!

01:06:57.417 --> 01:06:58.333
-Yes, she does.
-I do.

01:06:58.417 --> 01:06:59.875
-She so does.
-I do.

01:07:00.375 --> 01:07:01.625
Thanks.

01:07:01.708 --> 01:07:02.917
Dr. Coleman?

01:07:03.750 --> 01:07:05.083
Oh, my gosh. Go.

01:07:05.833 --> 01:07:07.333
That's my therapist!

01:07:07.417 --> 01:07:09.542
You nervous?

01:07:09.625 --> 01:07:11.958
Why would I be?
We're perfect for each other.

01:07:12.042 --> 01:07:13.042
You'll see.

01:07:13.958 --> 01:07:15.500
That's cryptic.

01:07:15.583 --> 01:07:17.583
Coleman/Reyes?

01:07:17.667 --> 01:07:19.583
-Go.
-Yes. That's us.

01:07:20.792 --> 01:07:21.833
My love.

01:07:23.583 --> 01:07:25.833
-So many ruffles.
-Yeah.

01:07:25.917 --> 01:07:27.250
There you go.

01:07:28.958 --> 01:07:30.167
How are you?

01:07:30.708 --> 01:07:33.125
I was just dumped by my fiancé, so...

01:07:33.208 --> 01:07:34.625
-You know.
-Oh, no.

01:07:34.708 --> 01:07:36.833
I'm so sorry.

01:07:37.500 --> 01:07:39.542
What a decent thing to say. Thank you.

01:07:39.625 --> 01:07:40.458
Yes, of course.

01:07:40.542 --> 01:07:41.750
Are you single?

01:07:42.542 --> 01:07:43.875
Kidding!

01:07:45.542 --> 01:07:47.125
Can I see your paperwork?

01:07:47.208 --> 01:07:48.417
-Yes.
-Yeah.

01:07:48.500 --> 01:07:49.542
I'm sure you're approved.

01:07:49.625 --> 01:07:52.375
Wait. Don't you need to see
if we really know each other?

01:07:52.458 --> 01:07:53.458
I mean, usually, yeah,

01:07:53.542 --> 01:07:58.083
but he seems like
such a kind and honest man

01:07:58.167 --> 01:07:59.542
who clearly works out.

01:07:59.625 --> 01:08:00.917
A lot.

01:08:01.542 --> 01:08:02.833
I mean you could be a gymnast.

01:08:02.917 --> 01:08:04.667
I did once qualify
to represent the UK in pole vaulting.

01:08:04.750 --> 01:08:06.125
You're kidding. Really?

01:08:06.208 --> 01:08:09.958
I'd still like for us to prove that we,
you know, are marriage material.

01:08:10.667 --> 01:08:13.625
So, what's my favorite road trip snack?

01:08:13.708 --> 01:08:16.542
7-Eleven hot dog dipped in blue Slurpee.

01:08:16.625 --> 01:08:17.875
Dream vacay?

01:08:17.957 --> 01:08:19.457
Taking the girls to the Galapagos.

01:08:19.542 --> 01:08:21.875
Harper would love the biodiversity

01:08:21.957 --> 01:08:24.082
and I think Lily could
really benefit from the dirt.

01:08:24.167 --> 01:08:27.082
Though she really just wants to see a...

01:08:27.167 --> 01:08:29.667
Komodo dragon in the wild.

01:08:29.750 --> 01:08:31.250
It's her favorite animal.

01:08:31.332 --> 01:08:35.167
These are too, too easy.
You gotta hit me with the hard stuff.

01:08:35.250 --> 01:08:38.500
What is my guilty pleasure pump-up song?

01:08:40.332 --> 01:08:44.582
Darling, I promised to never divulge
that highly-classified information.

01:08:44.667 --> 01:08:48.375
-See? He doesn't know me. At all. See?
-Okay.

01:08:48.457 --> 01:08:49.667
We can't get married.

01:08:49.750 --> 01:08:52.625
It's Chumbawamba.

01:08:53.792 --> 01:08:54.707
She told you?

01:08:54.792 --> 01:08:56.707
Wait. "Creepy Crawling" or "Tubthumping"?

01:09:06.167 --> 01:09:07.707
That's the one, yeah.

01:09:11.957 --> 01:09:13.042
Oh, wow.

01:09:21.582 --> 01:09:24.292
-Danny was my fiancé's name.
-Okay, enough.

01:09:25.082 --> 01:09:26.917
What's my deepest, darkest fear?

01:09:28.707 --> 01:09:31.332
That your love for Harper
and need to protect her

01:09:31.417 --> 01:09:33.832
will push her away
rather than bring her close.

01:09:34.625 --> 01:09:36.417
And then she'll run away and be a surf bum

01:09:36.500 --> 01:09:39.500
and then she'll get a dodgy tattoo
of the sun around her belly button.

01:09:41.082 --> 01:09:45.167
But you're a phenomenal mum
and Harper is amazing,

01:09:45.250 --> 01:09:46.957
so that will never happen.

01:09:50.957 --> 01:09:53.125
Well, that was really sweet.

01:09:53.207 --> 01:09:54.750
I didn't know that.

01:09:55.458 --> 01:09:59.583
You know, I approve hundreds of marriages
that probably won't even last a year.

01:10:00.292 --> 01:10:01.625
But you two...

01:10:08.167 --> 01:10:10.125
-Thank you.
-Next.

01:10:12.917 --> 01:10:14.750
Well done. We got approved.

01:10:16.708 --> 01:10:18.833
My seafood vendor says we canceled.

01:10:18.917 --> 01:10:20.250
-I should deal with this.
-Bet.

01:10:20.333 --> 01:10:22.167
-Yeah, my mom's almost here.
-Okay.

01:10:23.500 --> 01:10:24.333
Bye.

01:10:24.417 --> 01:10:25.250
What an odd mix-up.

01:10:27.667 --> 01:10:29.708
Hop in, muppet. How'd it go?

01:10:29.792 --> 01:10:32.583
Your dad knows a lot about my mom.

01:10:32.667 --> 01:10:36.125
-I think he really loves her.
-But did you do enough to break them up?

01:10:36.208 --> 01:10:37.583
I don't know.

01:10:37.667 --> 01:10:39.292
I need to clear my mind.

01:10:39.375 --> 01:10:42.417
-Can we go somewhere?
-Yes, yeah. Get in.

01:10:42.500 --> 01:10:43.500
Don't drive so fast.

01:10:43.583 --> 01:10:45.125
Okay. Buckle up!

01:10:47.375 --> 01:10:50.250
"Change the hearts you know are wrong
to reach the place where you belong."

01:10:50.333 --> 01:10:52.167
What do you think she meant by that?

01:10:52.250 --> 01:10:54.667
I think she made it all up,
but look on the bright side, honey,

01:10:54.750 --> 01:10:57.167
these scooters are so much fun!

01:10:57.250 --> 01:10:58.542
Why have we never done this before?

01:10:58.625 --> 01:11:01.583
Because you already have one fake hip
and you do not need another.

01:11:01.667 --> 01:11:06.750
Very funny. I'll have you know,
in this body, I have two real hips.

01:11:11.333 --> 01:11:12.625
Sorry. Sorry.

01:11:16.042 --> 01:11:17.042
Nothing broke!

01:11:18.833 --> 01:11:19.833
We're invincible!

01:11:19.917 --> 01:11:20.917
Bone density!

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:22.542
I'm not exhausted!

01:11:26.333 --> 01:11:30.833
Girls, get in the car.

01:11:33.083 --> 01:11:35.417
How do kids get away
with anything anymore?

01:11:51.250 --> 01:11:53.792
You know, I hated you a little less today.

01:11:55.792 --> 01:11:58.417
I think it's hard to hate me
when I look like your gran.

01:11:59.708 --> 01:12:00.708
And...

01:12:02.125 --> 01:12:04.958
I hated you a little less today too.

01:12:09.875 --> 01:12:13.583
I just don't understand
how anyone can dislike California.

01:12:13.667 --> 01:12:15.083
It's, like, a wrong opinion.

01:12:16.875 --> 01:12:19.042
Harper, you can't have a wrong opinion.

01:12:19.125 --> 01:12:21.042
I mean, look around.

01:12:21.125 --> 01:12:24.792
Yes. Okay, Harper, it's lovely.

01:12:24.875 --> 01:12:26.208
It's lovely.

01:12:26.958 --> 01:12:28.000
I just...

01:12:31.750 --> 01:12:33.250
I miss England.

01:12:39.708 --> 01:12:42.125
We can talk about her if you want.

01:12:44.833 --> 01:12:45.875
No, thanks.

01:12:48.208 --> 01:12:49.708
I think if I talk about her,

01:12:50.750 --> 01:12:52.708
I'm giving away
what little of her I have left.

01:12:55.167 --> 01:12:56.167
Okay.

01:12:58.167 --> 01:13:03.417
And why are you so
obsessed that I like Los Angeles?

01:13:03.500 --> 01:13:05.417
-Well, I'm not.
-Yes, you are.

01:13:05.500 --> 01:13:06.583
-No.
-Yes.

01:13:07.208 --> 01:13:11.125
And look, even if I liked it
a little bit here, I mean...

01:13:14.625 --> 01:13:17.875
You still don't want me around.

01:13:18.458 --> 01:13:21.000
-Obviously not.
-Obviously not.

01:13:22.333 --> 01:13:24.667
I guess it's a good thing
we're stopping this wedding.

01:13:26.125 --> 01:13:27.125
Yeah.

01:13:29.750 --> 01:13:31.917
Where are they?
They're supposed to be home by now.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.750
This is very good. A little dry.

01:13:35.792 --> 01:13:39.042
Very fruit-forward.
And by fruit, I mean grapes.

01:13:39.875 --> 01:13:42.583
Your lack of concern, it's not working.

01:13:42.667 --> 01:13:44.292
Just stay calm, honey.

01:13:45.042 --> 01:13:46.125
Stay calm?

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.583
But I've got the rehearsal lunch,
the final dress fitting,

01:13:49.667 --> 01:13:51.750
and my wedding is in 36 hours,

01:13:51.833 --> 01:13:53.667
and I'm trapped in the body
of a ninth-grader.

01:13:53.750 --> 01:13:56.833
-I did. I told you she approved it.
-You most certainly did not.

01:13:56.917 --> 01:13:58.458
What difference does it make, anyway?

01:13:58.542 --> 01:14:00.292
-It's done now.
-Where on earth have you been?

01:14:01.542 --> 01:14:02.708
Well...

01:14:02.792 --> 01:14:05.292
Can't two adult women
come home when they please?

01:14:05.375 --> 01:14:07.833
What do you think you're doing driving
around like that with Ella all day?

01:14:07.917 --> 01:14:11.583
Ella needs to talk to you, by the way.
You need to give her more attention.

01:14:11.667 --> 01:14:13.083
Why am I dressed like that?

01:14:13.167 --> 01:14:15.000
Just like I need more attention
from you sometimes.

01:14:15.083 --> 01:14:16.417
She has a lot of stuff
to talk to you about.

01:14:16.500 --> 01:14:17.833
She was crying.

01:14:17.917 --> 01:14:19.417
Okay, I don't care about that right now.

01:14:19.500 --> 01:14:20.958
Did you make it
to the Immigration interview?

01:14:21.042 --> 01:14:23.250
Yes, I did. Just, like, chill, okay?

01:14:23.333 --> 01:14:25.708
Or do your weird breathing stuff
that you do.

01:14:26.250 --> 01:14:27.250
Chill?

01:14:28.833 --> 01:14:31.792
I am the adult here. I'm in charge.

01:14:32.542 --> 01:14:33.875
Doesn't look like it.

01:14:33.958 --> 01:14:35.792
You just earned yourselves a consequence.

01:14:36.542 --> 01:14:38.208
-Oh, no.
-No.

01:14:38.292 --> 01:14:39.208
Give me your phones.

01:14:39.292 --> 01:14:40.125
-Sure.
-No.

01:14:40.750 --> 01:14:41.792
Psych.

01:14:41.875 --> 01:14:44.667
By the way, you're the reason
this is all falling apart.

01:14:44.750 --> 01:14:47.167
-Shut up. No, I'm not.
-Yes, it totally is. And don't...

01:14:47.250 --> 01:14:48.958
Girls, this is serious.

01:14:49.042 --> 01:14:52.333
We all need to start getting along unless
we want to be stuck like this forever.

01:14:52.417 --> 01:14:55.333
You know, you lot are getting
the better end of this deal.

01:14:55.417 --> 01:14:58.333
It's us who are gonna be dead
in, like, five years.

01:14:58.417 --> 01:14:59.417
She's 37.

01:14:59.500 --> 01:15:01.458
I'm 36 and a half!

01:15:01.542 --> 01:15:04.500
While you two were out having fun,
we found Madame Jen.

01:15:04.583 --> 01:15:08.792
And she made us buy business cards
for everyone and a Reiki ten-pack!

01:15:08.875 --> 01:15:11.208
What even is Reiki? Huh? What is it?

01:15:11.292 --> 01:15:12.375
Stop talking about Reiki!

01:15:12.458 --> 01:15:14.792
Well, Madame Jen said to
change your hearts,

01:15:14.875 --> 01:15:16.542
so change your freaking dang hearts.

01:15:16.625 --> 01:15:18.583
It's the only way for us
to get out of this mess.

01:15:18.667 --> 01:15:20.875
I'm switching to red. Do you want one?

01:15:20.958 --> 01:15:22.917
You're making Mommy very stressed!

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:24.375
Then use Reiki now!

01:16:11.042 --> 01:16:17.292
Okay, Blue Crush. Look at you.
Shredding the waves, dude.

01:16:17.375 --> 01:16:19.000
Never use those words again.

01:16:19.833 --> 01:16:21.875
Wait, what are you doing here?

01:16:21.958 --> 01:16:23.042
Our lessons.

01:16:24.708 --> 01:16:25.958
What lessons?

01:16:26.042 --> 01:16:27.000
Surf lessons.

01:16:28.333 --> 01:16:31.417
But it looks like you're ready
to surprise Harper and take her out.

01:16:31.500 --> 01:16:34.250
Oh, yeah.
That's really gonna surprise Harper.

01:16:34.875 --> 01:16:35.750
Obviously.

01:16:37.167 --> 01:16:38.625
No, I just ate a bowl of onions.

01:16:38.708 --> 01:16:39.833
In the water?

01:16:40.458 --> 01:16:41.458
Yeah, they keep me alert.

01:16:44.125 --> 01:16:45.208
Okay.

01:16:47.417 --> 01:16:53.917
Look, I know it feels like
we're in an impossible situation.

01:16:54.625 --> 01:16:57.625
Maybe that's why
things have felt a bit off with us.

01:16:58.625 --> 01:16:59.958
Yeah, probably.

01:17:00.667 --> 01:17:03.083
Yeah, but Anna...

01:17:05.250 --> 01:17:09.125
I think we should stay in LA.

01:17:11.167 --> 01:17:12.167
What about Lily?

01:17:14.500 --> 01:17:18.250
Going back to London, to Pembridge Hall,
it's not going to bring back her mum.

01:17:19.250 --> 01:17:22.583
And there's no one
keeping us there anymore.

01:17:23.417 --> 01:17:26.375
If I'm honest, we've felt so lost.

01:17:27.292 --> 01:17:29.583
So what she needs is to be with family.

01:17:30.417 --> 01:17:34.208
A gran like Tess,
a sister like Harper, and you.

01:17:41.417 --> 01:17:42.292
What is it?

01:17:42.833 --> 01:17:48.375
It's just... I can't believe
how much you love me and my family.

01:17:49.333 --> 01:17:53.333
It's a real, true love.
It's just... It's crazy.

01:17:54.083 --> 01:17:56.667
Okay. Well, you made it look so easy.

01:17:57.375 --> 01:17:58.375
I'm gonna give it a go.

01:17:59.250 --> 01:18:01.792
-I don't know if that's--
-Maybe I've improved as much as you!

01:18:06.208 --> 01:18:07.500
I'm okay!

01:18:11.333 --> 01:18:14.375
No. I'm gonna wait.
I'm gonna wait for the instructor.

01:18:15.250 --> 01:18:16.875
I mean, you were amazing.

01:18:16.958 --> 01:18:20.250
You were, like, weaving and dodging,
and you're like a pro surfer.

01:18:21.083 --> 01:18:23.000
-I'm glad we talked.
-Yeah, me too.

01:18:24.250 --> 01:18:25.833
It's good we came to a decision.

01:18:25.917 --> 01:18:27.375
Yeah, dude. Really good.

01:18:28.042 --> 01:18:29.125
See you at the rehearsal lunch!

01:18:29.208 --> 01:18:31.917
Totally, but my mom said I have to...

01:18:35.333 --> 01:18:37.292
It fits perfectly. Anna, come look.

01:18:37.375 --> 01:18:38.875
Oh, wow.

01:18:40.542 --> 01:18:44.667
Sweetheart, fix your posture.

01:18:45.667 --> 01:18:46.667
This is weird.

01:18:47.750 --> 01:18:49.708
Weirder for me, trust me.

01:18:49.792 --> 01:18:52.417
Really? Are you the one
wearing your mom's wedding dress?

01:18:52.500 --> 01:18:55.417
Well, I never thought
I'd get to have this experience.

01:18:55.500 --> 01:18:56.917
Especially like this.

01:18:57.792 --> 01:19:00.375
Well, Mom,
you know how much I love to wear a dress.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.250
I'm sorry this is such a mess, Harper.

01:19:03.333 --> 01:19:05.542
Mom, there's something I need to tell you.

01:19:11.292 --> 01:19:14.000
What were you talking to my dad about
this morning?

01:19:14.875 --> 01:19:16.750
We were just talking about the lunch.

01:19:17.750 --> 01:19:18.958
What about the lunch?

01:19:19.042 --> 01:19:20.125
Just lunch stuff.

01:19:24.458 --> 01:19:27.250
Oh, right. The lunch.

01:19:29.500 --> 01:19:30.500
Okay.

01:19:32.792 --> 01:19:34.792
I'm just gonna make a quick call.

01:19:34.875 --> 01:19:35.875
Okay.

01:19:35.958 --> 01:19:36.958
Okay.

01:19:52.917 --> 01:19:55.583
Hi! It's Tess.

01:19:56.875 --> 01:20:00.167
Listen, last minute but Anna was wondering

01:20:00.250 --> 01:20:03.375
if you might like to attend
her rehearsal luncheon.

01:20:04.708 --> 01:20:08.083
No, no. You would not be an imposition.
You know what?

01:20:08.167 --> 01:20:11.542
I think your appearance there
would make it a much more lively affair.

01:20:15.333 --> 01:20:18.417
So, I just wanted to say
that I'm very excited.

01:20:18.500 --> 01:20:21.250
And being at my new restaurant
makes it all the more special

01:20:21.333 --> 01:20:23.833
for all of us to finally
come together as a family.

01:20:23.917 --> 01:20:26.875
So with that said, welcome to Lily's.

01:20:26.958 --> 01:20:27.958
Congratulations.

01:20:28.042 --> 01:20:30.917
Thank you for coming.
Really, Eric and I so appreciate it.

01:20:32.708 --> 01:20:33.708
Right. Thanks.

01:20:35.042 --> 01:20:35.917
Champagne, ladies?

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.458
-Yes, please.
-Yes, please. 'Cause we're adults.

01:20:38.542 --> 01:20:41.958
Girls, Eric's parents are here
so best behavior, please.

01:20:42.042 --> 01:20:43.875
Stand up straight. Good posture.

01:20:43.958 --> 01:20:48.958
Anna, my soon-to-be daughter.
My heart is so full.

01:20:49.042 --> 01:20:50.458
That's me.

01:20:51.208 --> 01:20:52.250
How was your flight?

01:20:52.792 --> 01:20:55.667
It was 13 hours and 30 minutes
from Manila.

01:20:55.750 --> 01:20:58.833
Major jet lag. Some worse than others.

01:20:58.917 --> 01:21:03.958
But I really love it here.
Maybe Harper can teach me the surfing.

01:21:04.042 --> 01:21:06.292
-Sure, dude.
-Mano po, Lola.

01:21:07.750 --> 01:21:10.583
You're so silly. Only Lily calls me Lola.

01:21:10.667 --> 01:21:14.750
But I want to support
your Tagalog learning. Keep it up.

01:21:14.833 --> 01:21:17.292
-Come on, Anna. Let's have a drink.
-No, no, no, no. We just...

01:21:17.375 --> 01:21:19.250
We have to wait for the surprise guest.

01:21:19.833 --> 01:21:20.958
What are you talking about?

01:21:21.042 --> 01:21:22.667
Just wait.

01:21:22.750 --> 01:21:26.083
-Hello, sir. Welcome.
-No, thank you.

01:21:26.167 --> 01:21:27.708
-I'm here to see someone.
-Jake?

01:21:28.417 --> 01:21:29.708
Just alone or...

01:21:29.792 --> 01:21:30.833
What's he doing here?

01:21:30.917 --> 01:21:32.583
I invited him
but I didn't think he'd come.

01:21:32.667 --> 01:21:34.708
But, you know, he really likes your gran.

01:21:34.792 --> 01:21:36.250
My mom's gonna freak out,

01:21:36.333 --> 01:21:37.583
-you know that?
-I know. So will my dad.

01:21:37.667 --> 01:21:38.875
That was the whole point.

01:21:38.958 --> 01:21:40.292
You...

01:21:40.375 --> 01:21:44.542
Dr. C. Thank you for inviting me.

01:21:44.625 --> 01:21:47.292
I saved your number. I hope that's okay.

01:21:47.375 --> 01:21:48.958
Of course.

01:21:49.708 --> 01:21:50.958
-Hi, there.
-Hey.

01:21:51.625 --> 01:21:53.208
I think I'm gonna
have to ask you to leave.

01:21:54.167 --> 01:21:58.333
Now? But, you know, your mom,
she really wanted me here.

01:21:58.417 --> 01:22:01.125
Right. I'm sure. Well...

01:22:05.083 --> 01:22:06.083
Okay.

01:22:07.042 --> 01:22:08.708
-I got you.
-Thank you so much.

01:22:08.792 --> 01:22:10.458
-You're the best, bro.
-No, no, no. Wait.

01:22:10.542 --> 01:22:11.417
-Wait!
-Thank goodness.

01:22:11.500 --> 01:22:12.708
I will be right back.

01:22:12.792 --> 01:22:14.750
-No, no. Jake, don't go. No.
-Tess. Tess.

01:22:14.833 --> 01:22:16.500
-Yes?
-Can we have a chat later?

01:22:16.583 --> 01:22:17.583
It's regarding Lily.

01:22:18.458 --> 01:22:20.750
If it's regarding Lily,
we should chat now.

01:22:20.833 --> 01:22:21.958
My big sister, Anna.

01:22:22.042 --> 01:22:24.708
After every atomic wedgie you gave me,

01:22:24.792 --> 01:22:27.875
I always knew that you
also had an atomic heart.

01:22:27.958 --> 01:22:29.250
-Cheers.
-Cheers!

01:22:29.333 --> 01:22:32.417
Anna and I decided
we should all stay in LA.

01:22:34.125 --> 01:22:34.958
What?

01:22:35.042 --> 01:22:35.875
Yes.

01:22:35.958 --> 01:22:37.625
What... Everyone?

01:22:37.708 --> 01:22:38.708
Yes.

01:22:39.375 --> 01:22:40.583
As a therapist,

01:22:40.667 --> 01:22:43.958
I was hoping to get your thoughts
on the best way to approach it with Lily.

01:22:46.417 --> 01:22:48.125
But, I know how you feel
about billable hours

01:22:48.208 --> 01:22:50.250
so we can chat later. Yeah?

01:22:50.333 --> 01:22:51.708
Okay. Okay.

01:23:00.750 --> 01:23:03.208
-You bloody backstabber.
-What?

01:23:03.292 --> 01:23:06.042
-I know what you did.
-All right, who wants to speak next?

01:23:06.125 --> 01:23:07.708
Father of the groom looks ready.

01:23:07.792 --> 01:23:10.333
No, no.
I have a few choice words for the bride.

01:23:10.417 --> 01:23:12.042
I would like to make a toast.

01:23:12.125 --> 01:23:13.125
That's crystal.

01:23:13.208 --> 01:23:14.917
We have a toasting triangle.

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:16.375
-Piss off.
-Okay.

01:23:17.208 --> 01:23:19.958
I would like to make a toast
to your future husband

01:23:20.042 --> 01:23:24.667
so that he knows what kind of woman
he is getting married to.

01:23:25.417 --> 01:23:27.625
He does, he does, he does.

01:23:27.708 --> 01:23:30.875
He knows who he's marrying
and he can make his own decisions

01:23:30.958 --> 01:23:33.542
and he knows not to be
manipulated by other people.

01:23:33.625 --> 01:23:34.833
Tess.

01:23:34.917 --> 01:23:37.458
Hey, gramps, this is between us.

01:23:37.542 --> 01:23:38.792
Listen to your husband.

01:23:38.875 --> 01:23:41.167
You listen to me.

01:23:41.250 --> 01:23:42.875
Ella. What does she want?

01:23:43.458 --> 01:23:45.708
Micro cilantro
from the foothills of Oaxaca.

01:23:45.792 --> 01:23:47.125
It was not my fault.

01:23:47.667 --> 01:23:50.667
That micro cilantro
is bursting with flavor.

01:23:50.750 --> 01:23:55.500
But it is your fault that the cilantro
has no loyalty to...

01:23:55.583 --> 01:23:57.875
-What are they doing?
-We have to stop them.

01:23:57.958 --> 01:23:59.417
Are you doing all right, Harp?

01:23:59.958 --> 01:24:02.500
Ella, this is the last thing I need.

01:24:02.583 --> 01:24:03.708
Jake's back already.

01:24:03.792 --> 01:24:04.833
Jake? Who?

01:24:04.917 --> 01:24:06.875
Jake, what... What are you doing here?

01:24:06.958 --> 01:24:08.625
It was all her, I swear.

01:24:08.708 --> 01:24:10.625
Hello. And you are?

01:24:10.708 --> 01:24:12.125
That's Anna's ex-boyfriend.

01:24:12.208 --> 01:24:15.292
-What? Why?
-She invited her ex-boyfriend?

01:24:15.375 --> 01:24:16.292
What?

01:24:16.375 --> 01:24:17.875
Because she still has feelings for him.

01:24:17.958 --> 01:24:19.708
-Okay. That's not-- That's...
-I never said...

01:24:19.792 --> 01:24:21.500
What? I...

01:24:21.583 --> 01:24:24.792
After the appetizer, Anna said
she wasn't feeling well so I went--

01:24:24.875 --> 01:24:26.250
Right. I wasn't feeling well.

01:24:27.375 --> 01:24:29.833
Okay, but not from the food here.
The food is fine.

01:24:29.917 --> 01:24:31.583
-Too fishy. No.
-It's fish.

01:24:31.667 --> 01:24:35.917
It is not the food.
She's just on her period. That's all.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:36.958
She's on her period.

01:24:37.042 --> 01:24:38.375
Okay.

01:24:38.458 --> 01:24:39.500
I'm on mine right now.

01:24:39.583 --> 01:24:40.542
-I got it.
-I didn't know

01:24:40.625 --> 01:24:42.875
-where you are in your cycle...
-I know, dude. It's fine. Thanks.

01:24:42.958 --> 01:24:44.542
Can someone please explain to me

01:24:44.625 --> 01:24:46.333
-what's going on here.
-I don't know.

01:24:46.417 --> 01:24:47.458
-Let's just tell the truth.
-Don't let her.

01:24:47.542 --> 01:24:50.583
She shouldn't explain anything
because she will just lie.

01:24:50.667 --> 01:24:52.000
-Hey, me?
-She lies.

01:24:52.083 --> 01:24:54.333
-Yeah.
-I trusted you.

01:24:54.417 --> 01:24:57.042
I know,
but you don't know what he said to me.

01:24:57.125 --> 01:24:58.750
You weren't there. You didn't hear it.

01:24:59.792 --> 01:25:02.250
I don't think this marriage should happen.

01:25:02.333 --> 01:25:05.083
Well, you know what?
It's not just about what you want.

01:25:05.167 --> 01:25:08.083
-It's about what she wants and she wants--
-It isn't ever about what I want.

01:25:08.167 --> 01:25:09.833
-It's always about what you want.
-That's enough.

01:25:09.917 --> 01:25:11.125
Does everyone want this?

01:25:11.208 --> 01:25:13.500
-Okay, that's enough.
-Well, yes. Some of them do.

01:25:13.583 --> 01:25:14.792
Hey, that's enough!

01:25:19.333 --> 01:25:22.958
The girls fighting is one thing
but this is your mum.

01:25:23.750 --> 01:25:26.250
And for some reason,
your ex-boyfriend is here.

01:25:27.500 --> 01:25:28.333
Yeah.

01:25:28.417 --> 01:25:33.792
Anna, I love you
but you're clearly having second thoughts.

01:25:36.250 --> 01:25:38.500
This isn't working for our families,

01:25:38.583 --> 01:25:41.375
and we always said
we'd put our families first.

01:25:42.500 --> 01:25:43.500
So...

01:25:47.083 --> 01:25:48.083
We can't do this.

01:25:50.667 --> 01:25:52.125
I can't do this.

01:25:54.458 --> 01:25:57.417
Lily, help your grandparents.
I'll meet you at the valet.

01:25:58.333 --> 01:25:59.333
The wedding's off.

01:26:01.208 --> 01:26:03.083
He's right. It's over.

01:26:03.875 --> 01:26:04.875
Wait, no.

01:26:06.083 --> 01:26:08.167
-Wait, please, please, please.
-No.

01:26:08.250 --> 01:26:10.833
I'm so sorry. I promise,
I didn't mean for this to happen.

01:26:13.417 --> 01:26:14.583
I think you did.

01:26:20.250 --> 01:26:21.250
Well...

01:26:24.833 --> 01:26:27.833
-I guess we did it.
-Yeah.

01:26:36.083 --> 01:26:40.292
I know this isn't the best time
but can I have my car back?

01:26:45.875 --> 01:26:47.042
Maybe later.

01:27:05.750 --> 01:27:06.750
Mom!

01:27:09.625 --> 01:27:10.958
She seems upset.

01:27:11.833 --> 01:27:13.500
No, she just needs some space.

01:27:17.875 --> 01:27:20.750
What about you? Are you doing okay?

01:27:21.458 --> 01:27:23.292
Oh, yeah. I'm always okay.

01:27:25.333 --> 01:27:30.708
It would be fair if you weren't.
That all got pretty crazy.

01:27:33.792 --> 01:27:38.250
I worry what will happen when Tess
doesn't have those two to drive her crazy.

01:27:40.458 --> 01:27:42.125
You're worried about her?

01:27:45.375 --> 01:27:49.750
I'm worried Tess would be really lonely
if all of you moved to London.

01:27:52.083 --> 01:27:53.875
You're a good guy, Ryan.

01:27:56.042 --> 01:28:02.042
Thank you. Go on.
Maybe this isn't for me to fix.

01:28:10.292 --> 01:28:11.792
Mind if I join you?

01:28:15.375 --> 01:28:17.083
-Okay.
-Okay.

01:28:21.458 --> 01:28:22.500
Are you okay?

01:28:25.708 --> 01:28:27.750
I haven't seen my dad that upset...

01:28:30.750 --> 01:28:32.000
since my mum died.

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:37.375
And it was all my fault.

01:28:39.833 --> 01:28:44.083
You know, when Ryan asked me to marry him,

01:28:45.917 --> 01:28:49.583
I thought a lot about
what Anna and Harry's dad would have said.

01:28:51.875 --> 01:28:53.375
How he would have felt about it.

01:28:54.958 --> 01:28:57.208
I think he'd be so happy for us.

01:28:59.167 --> 01:29:03.250
That we found someone
who loved us all so much.

01:29:13.458 --> 01:29:15.792
-I think my mum would feel the same way.
-Yeah.

01:29:17.708 --> 01:29:21.792
-I really miss her.
-I know. It's okay.

01:29:21.875 --> 01:29:23.625
She would be so disappointed in me.

01:29:23.708 --> 01:29:25.958
-No, no, no.
-Yes, she would.

01:29:26.042 --> 01:29:29.042
Because I was very selfish. I was.

01:29:29.125 --> 01:29:30.083
No.

01:29:30.167 --> 01:29:32.875
I was, and I know it.

01:29:33.958 --> 01:29:38.292
No, she'd know your heart.

01:29:41.958 --> 01:29:45.333
-I just... I should... Find my dad...
-Yeah.

01:29:46.750 --> 01:29:48.167
...and apologize.

01:29:56.542 --> 01:29:59.333
Ella, Ella, Ella,

01:29:59.417 --> 01:30:01.875
Ella, Ella, Ella,

01:30:01.958 --> 01:30:04.542
Ella, Ella, Ella,

01:30:04.625 --> 01:30:07.292
Ella, Ella, Ella...

01:30:07.833 --> 01:30:11.708
Why are you walking so fast?
I can't walk as fast as you.

01:30:11.792 --> 01:30:15.083
Ella keeps texting me the word "urgent,"
and her show starts, like, now.

01:30:15.167 --> 01:30:17.333
But what about Eric?
I think we should go back, Mom.

01:30:17.417 --> 01:30:19.208
I thought there was a way
to make everyone happy

01:30:19.292 --> 01:30:20.667
but there's not, right?

01:30:20.750 --> 01:30:22.333
But I think that we should
go back for Eric.

01:30:22.417 --> 01:30:24.750
-I really should--
-Come on. My client needs me.

01:30:26.250 --> 01:30:29.000
Ella, Ella, Ella...

01:30:43.125 --> 01:30:45.667
Don't go! Stop the car!

01:30:45.750 --> 01:30:48.250
-Tess?
-Don't go! Stop the engine!

01:30:48.333 --> 01:30:51.042
I'm not. The engine's not even on.

01:31:05.667 --> 01:31:08.792
-Ella, he loves you!
-I love you!

01:31:13.458 --> 01:31:14.750
Shelly, is everything okay?

01:31:14.833 --> 01:31:16.042
Yeah, everything's fine.

01:31:16.125 --> 01:31:17.125
Okay.

01:31:17.958 --> 01:31:19.667
I wonder what the big emergency was.

01:31:23.958 --> 01:31:24.958
Surprise!

01:31:25.708 --> 01:31:28.417
-What are you doing here?
-Ella said you said you missed performing.

01:31:28.500 --> 01:31:29.333
I--

01:31:29.417 --> 01:31:31.583
Yeah, and that you told her
she could do any song she wanted to.

01:31:32.542 --> 01:31:33.667
You did?

01:31:33.750 --> 01:31:36.167
Dressing room is right around the corner.
Put this on.

01:31:36.250 --> 01:31:38.792
-Why?
-Well, because we're not 15 anymore.

01:31:38.875 --> 01:31:39.792
Dolphins.

01:31:39.875 --> 01:31:41.000
-Get in there. Okay.
-What?

01:31:41.083 --> 01:31:42.583
-Let me know when she's ready.
-Crazy.

01:31:42.667 --> 01:31:45.458
I can't believe you're making me do this.
Don't make fun of my dress.

01:31:54.125 --> 01:31:55.333
I'm sorry.

01:31:56.417 --> 01:32:00.417
This is all my fault.
Lily and I tried to sabotage you and Eric.

01:32:01.375 --> 01:32:03.875
And I tried to make him
fall out of love with you,

01:32:03.958 --> 01:32:07.542
but I couldn't because
he loves you so much.

01:32:07.625 --> 01:32:10.583
And Mom,
you shouldn't have to give that up for me.

01:32:10.667 --> 01:32:13.208
Just like you gave up being a rock star.

01:32:13.917 --> 01:32:17.583
And I know you've been
secretly writing songs in private.

01:32:17.667 --> 01:32:19.000
What?

01:32:19.083 --> 01:32:21.417
You know, the one about Jake.

01:32:21.958 --> 01:32:23.625
What are you talking about?

01:32:24.417 --> 01:32:27.333
"I'm your good and I'm your bad
'cause you're my baby.

01:32:27.417 --> 01:32:29.042
And love was made to last."

01:32:32.458 --> 01:32:36.708
Harper, that song is not about Jake.

01:32:37.292 --> 01:32:39.375
That song is about you.

01:32:39.458 --> 01:32:40.542
About me?

01:32:40.625 --> 01:32:42.375
Of course it is...

01:32:42.958 --> 01:32:44.208
Harp.

01:32:44.917 --> 01:32:48.875
Mom, I'm sorry that I said
I wanted to stay with Grams if you left.

01:32:48.958 --> 01:32:53.042
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry that I made you
think that you had to choose

01:32:53.125 --> 01:32:56.708
between being together or being at home.

01:32:57.875 --> 01:32:59.750
I choose you every time.

01:33:01.333 --> 01:33:02.500
Okay.

01:33:02.583 --> 01:33:04.542
We gotta go.
Look, we look like a grown-up.

01:33:04.625 --> 01:33:06.792
-Let's go, let's go, let's go.
-Where am I going now?

01:33:07.583 --> 01:33:09.000
If you'll excuse me,
I have to go get Lily.

01:33:09.083 --> 01:33:10.542
No, no, no, no. Please.

01:33:10.625 --> 01:33:13.875
I know I said I didn't want
this wedding to go on,

01:33:13.958 --> 01:33:16.958
but that's not true. It's just not.

01:33:17.042 --> 01:33:18.042
I...

01:33:18.958 --> 01:33:20.667
I was scared.

01:33:20.750 --> 01:33:27.042
And I think I realized
that I didn't wanna share someone I love.

01:33:27.125 --> 01:33:30.417
-I appreciate that, Tess. I do--
-But... But wait. But please.

01:33:30.500 --> 01:33:31.917
You still love Anna.

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:33.542
You still wanna get married.

01:33:33.625 --> 01:33:34.833
-I--
-Do you?

01:33:34.917 --> 01:33:35.958
-I--
-Do you love her?

01:33:36.042 --> 01:33:36.875
I love Anna.

01:33:36.958 --> 01:33:39.458
-Do you wanna marry her?
-I wanna marry Anna.

01:33:39.542 --> 01:33:41.833
-But then what?
-But it's not about me!

01:33:43.500 --> 01:33:46.750
Lily is the most important person
in my life.

01:33:46.833 --> 01:33:49.792
And I worry every day
I'm messing up as a parent.

01:33:49.875 --> 01:33:51.958
Okay? I am on my own.

01:33:52.042 --> 01:33:55.625
I lost her mum,
and I am so scared of losing her.

01:33:57.750 --> 01:33:59.333
So I have to put her first.

01:34:01.208 --> 01:34:03.000
What if you were right all along?

01:34:04.250 --> 01:34:10.542
What if being here with the Colemans
is exactly what she needs?

01:34:11.958 --> 01:34:13.542
I thought so too.

01:34:14.250 --> 01:34:15.708
But after all this...

01:34:17.042 --> 01:34:18.417
I'm not sure.

01:34:20.333 --> 01:34:21.417
I am.

01:34:38.875 --> 01:34:40.417
I love you so much!

01:34:40.500 --> 01:34:44.042
I have a little surprise guest for you.

01:34:44.125 --> 01:34:47.875
Give it up for one of my favorite bands,
Pink Slip!

01:34:50.958 --> 01:34:53.417
No. Why are you guys doing this to me?

01:34:53.500 --> 01:34:55.167
-You all right?
-No, no, no.

01:34:55.250 --> 01:34:57.208
No, Mom. I don't know how to play guitar.

01:34:57.292 --> 01:34:58.750
-It's all right, okay? I do.
-I can't. No.

01:34:58.833 --> 01:35:01.583
This is a bad idea. No, no, no, no, no.

01:35:01.667 --> 01:35:03.542
-Harper! Harper, go!
-No. No. No.

01:35:03.625 --> 01:35:05.000
Pink Slip! Pink Slip!

01:35:05.083 --> 01:35:07.500
Pink Slip! Pink Slip! Pink Slip!

01:35:08.042 --> 01:35:12.083
My friend is gonna be singing
her brand-new song tonight!

01:35:14.375 --> 01:35:16.750
-Anna.
-Mom, you suck.

01:35:31.250 --> 01:35:32.417
Anna.

01:35:32.500 --> 01:35:33.500
What are you doing?

01:35:37.333 --> 01:35:39.208
-Go like this.
-Like what?

01:35:39.292 --> 01:35:40.458
Mm-mmm.

01:35:44.333 --> 01:35:45.833
-You got this.
-Okay.

01:35:47.375 --> 01:35:48.708
-Yes.
-No.

01:35:48.792 --> 01:35:50.250
Mm-mmm. No.

01:35:50.333 --> 01:35:51.583
Yes, you can.

01:36:02.375 --> 01:36:05.958
Do you know what? Wait. Can we...
Can we stop for a second?

01:36:06.667 --> 01:36:11.917
Sorry. I just... I wanna bring out
the person that I wrote this song for.

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:16.083
She means everything to me,
and I love her so much.

01:36:16.167 --> 01:36:21.333
I know that family isn't always easy,
but family is everything.

01:36:21.417 --> 01:36:24.042
She also plays guitar way better than me.

01:36:24.958 --> 01:36:28.333
So please welcome my daughter, Harper.

01:36:50.083 --> 01:36:52.917
Ready to do this? Together?

01:36:53.833 --> 01:36:54.958
Yeah.

01:37:22.208 --> 01:37:25.000
What are we doing here?
This is silly. Anna and I are--

01:37:25.083 --> 01:37:28.042
-Are madly in love. I know.
-We tried. We really did. It's just not--

01:37:28.125 --> 01:37:30.125
No, no, no, no. Please.
Just give us one more chance.

01:37:30.208 --> 01:37:32.000
-Please.
-Just trust us.

01:37:32.083 --> 01:37:33.333
I just--

01:37:33.417 --> 01:37:35.208
Is... Wait, is that...

01:37:36.167 --> 01:37:37.167
Is that Anna?

01:37:46.458 --> 01:37:47.458
Excuse me.

01:37:52.958 --> 01:37:56.750
Ella gave me these yesterday.
Come with me. Come with me. Come on.

01:38:08.875 --> 01:38:10.792
-We get to be here.
-Yep.

01:38:18.792 --> 01:38:21.042
Is Ella wearing one of my designs?

01:38:21.125 --> 01:38:23.167
It was Anna's idea.

01:39:16.250 --> 01:39:18.667
Mom, I'll always choose you too.

01:39:23.917 --> 01:39:26.708
This family is exactly where I belong.

01:39:31.167 --> 01:39:32.167
Wait.

01:40:09.625 --> 01:40:11.375
Are you okay?

01:40:11.458 --> 01:40:12.458
Yeah.

01:40:24.750 --> 01:40:25.833
You sure?

01:40:25.917 --> 01:40:27.250
Uh-huh.

01:40:27.750 --> 01:40:29.708
Okay. All right. Let's just...

01:40:29.792 --> 01:40:31.042
That's better.

01:40:31.125 --> 01:40:32.250
Okay.

01:40:32.333 --> 01:40:34.292
Thank you, Los Angeles.

01:40:34.375 --> 01:40:37.292
And Eric, if you're out there
and you'll still have me,

01:40:37.375 --> 01:40:39.125
I can't wait to marry you.

01:40:40.542 --> 01:40:43.542
I can't wait to marry you too!

01:40:43.625 --> 01:40:44.750
What?

01:40:45.583 --> 01:40:47.208
I said yes!

01:40:48.292 --> 01:40:51.125
Okay, well, whatever that was,
just get him up here.

01:40:51.208 --> 01:40:54.292
Excuse me. Pardon me. Excuse me.

01:40:57.750 --> 01:41:00.250
-Did you know she could do that?
-Not at all.

01:41:09.417 --> 01:41:12.667
-We did it!
-Yes! You two did it.

01:41:12.750 --> 01:41:14.375
You did it together.

01:41:15.667 --> 01:41:17.750
-We did.
-I know.

01:41:24.708 --> 01:41:28.500
Wherever my sister is,
it's where I want to be.

01:41:29.458 --> 01:41:30.792
Me too.

01:42:06.542 --> 01:42:08.458
It's him! That's the guy!

01:42:08.542 --> 01:42:09.958
-Excuse me.
-It's him!

01:42:26.333 --> 01:42:29.000
No, no, no. I just need to get down.

01:42:38.708 --> 01:42:40.375
They still got it!

01:42:57.917 --> 01:43:00.000
No, I just need to get down. Okay.

01:43:00.083 --> 01:43:02.583
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.292
-I can't believe you just did that.
-I know.

01:43:09.375 --> 01:43:10.667
So what do you say?

01:43:10.750 --> 01:43:12.000
Will you marry me?

01:43:13.125 --> 01:43:14.542
One condition.

01:43:14.625 --> 01:43:16.667
I'm kissing you early.

01:43:49.917 --> 01:43:50.917
Hi, Jake.

01:43:51.958 --> 01:43:55.417
Dr. Coleman. This is Bess.

01:43:55.500 --> 01:43:59.333
We just met,
but there is something about her.

01:43:59.417 --> 01:44:03.167
-Yes. Nice dress.
-Thank you.

01:44:03.250 --> 01:44:07.083
Did you hear that? Nice dress.
She likes your dress.

01:44:31.542 --> 01:44:33.583
We'll go somewhere to eat after this.

01:44:33.667 --> 01:44:34.917
Thanks for coming, everybody.

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:36.417
-I see.
-We're here, Mom.

01:44:36.500 --> 01:44:38.250
-All right.
-Here we are.

01:44:45.333 --> 01:44:46.333
Wait.

01:44:49.625 --> 01:44:52.250
Girls! What did you do?

01:44:52.333 --> 01:44:53.875
It's called lip plumper.

01:44:53.958 --> 01:44:54.958
-Run.
-Wh--

01:44:56.583 --> 01:44:57.792
It could be worse.

01:44:57.875 --> 01:45:00.167
-It could be worse, you know.
-It could not be worse!

01:45:00.250 --> 01:45:01.917
I mean... It's okay.

01:45:02.708 --> 01:45:04.208
Just testing out a new look.

01:45:09.292 --> 01:45:10.958
Camera's A marker.

01:45:11.042 --> 01:45:12.292
Hi, everybody.

01:45:12.375 --> 01:45:14.125
Welcome to Freakier Friday.

01:45:17.583 --> 01:45:19.750
What? Ryan, I'm fine.

01:45:19.833 --> 01:45:21.250
I don't need...

01:45:22.833 --> 01:45:24.208
It's so good, you can't do it.

01:45:24.292 --> 01:45:25.292
What?

01:45:26.708 --> 01:45:28.417
-What?
-That's the right...

01:45:29.458 --> 01:45:30.917
-No, no, no. Banana.
-Banana.

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.042
I have Mystery Date.

01:45:33.125 --> 01:45:35.542
Truth is,
I bet you the dud is very hot now.

01:45:35.625 --> 01:45:36.625
I see.

01:45:39.125 --> 01:45:40.583
Are we talking about the board game?

01:45:42.500 --> 01:45:44.500
Jamie just turned around like this.

01:45:44.583 --> 01:45:45.750
She was like this.

01:45:45.833 --> 01:45:47.625
-Mom?
-Yes?

01:45:53.542 --> 01:45:55.667
You know, last time.

01:45:56.208 --> 01:45:57.750
Okay, I'm locking in.

01:45:57.833 --> 01:45:59.625
We have to find her.

01:45:59.708 --> 01:46:00.958
But until then--

01:46:01.042 --> 01:46:02.875
Until then, what?

01:46:02.958 --> 01:46:04.958
I don't know why I keep going...

01:46:09.167 --> 01:46:10.667
I can't. Sorry.

01:46:13.875 --> 01:46:16.042
Okay, Jamie, reach for the enema box.

01:46:21.958 --> 01:46:23.375
She's had 29 doughnuts.

01:46:23.958 --> 01:46:25.000
Just give me the doughnut.

01:46:25.083 --> 01:46:26.417
You're prediabetic.

01:46:27.167 --> 01:46:28.417
What's that?

01:46:31.792 --> 01:46:32.792
Not supposed to eat those.

01:46:32.875 --> 01:46:34.458
You learned a lesson.

01:46:35.667 --> 01:46:37.667
My God, I could be a pirate, huh?

01:46:38.542 --> 01:46:40.000
You fancy that?

01:46:40.083 --> 01:46:41.375
Put on my jumper, eat my---

01:46:43.542 --> 01:46:45.708
You wanna fight? I can fight too.

01:46:45.792 --> 01:46:47.042
Let's fight!

01:46:47.125 --> 01:46:48.792
Oh, my God.

01:46:48.875 --> 01:46:50.042
Let us out!

01:46:50.125 --> 01:46:51.292
Let us out!

01:46:51.375 --> 01:46:53.500
-Do you want to be fired?
-It's a hit.

01:46:56.708 --> 01:46:58.708
Anna Louise Coleman, do you think--

01:46:58.792 --> 01:47:01.750
Is that my middle name?

01:47:01.833 --> 01:47:03.583
Yes, it is your middle name.

01:47:09.542 --> 01:47:10.958
That's different.

01:47:11.042 --> 01:47:12.542
What's that? The pink Power Ranger?

01:47:12.625 --> 01:47:15.208
I'm kidding. I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

01:47:15.292 --> 01:47:17.583
Let's not. Let's not. Let's not.

01:47:17.667 --> 01:47:19.042
Oh, my God!

01:47:20.792 --> 01:47:21.792
What the hell is she?

01:47:21.875 --> 01:47:24.750
What's that? A Pepto Bismol? Come on.
What is she doing?

01:47:26.875 --> 01:47:28.667
Here we are. In the pelvis.

01:47:28.750 --> 01:47:30.333
Like peanut butter molasses.

01:47:30.417 --> 01:47:32.417
-Yes.
-Peanut butter molasses.

01:47:32.500 --> 01:47:33.542
Slow.

01:47:34.917 --> 01:47:38.000
Were any of those teenagers
a "Bad Boss Betty"?

01:47:38.083 --> 01:47:39.625
No. I'm sorry.

01:47:40.792 --> 01:47:41.917
Good. More.

01:47:43.458 --> 01:47:44.875
That really was so bad.

01:47:44.958 --> 01:47:46.917
What are you doing down there?

01:47:47.833 --> 01:47:48.958
Just crawling.

01:47:51.458 --> 01:47:52.667
Look at the road!

01:47:55.125 --> 01:47:56.958
-I got caught!
-Cut!

01:47:57.042 --> 01:47:58.833
That was fun.

01:47:58.917 --> 01:48:02.000
Thank you for watching.
We love you so much.

01:48:02.083 --> 01:48:04.458
-Thanks for coming.
-I think I just peed.

01:48:06.958 --> 01:48:08.000
Okay, cut.
