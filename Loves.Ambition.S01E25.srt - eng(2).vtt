00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:44.940
Wait...

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:45.780
I know

00:01:45.981 --> 00:01:47.140
there are rumors circulating,

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:48.021
that have

00:01:48.821 --> 00:01:50.300
damaged Yan Studio's reputation.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.580
But those are deliberate smears.

00:01:54.021 --> 00:01:55.300
The storm will pass.

00:01:55.621 --> 00:01:56.821
You are

00:01:56.821 --> 00:01:57.780
my collaborators.

00:01:58.021 --> 00:01:59.541
You know about our garment quality

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.381
and the high sales

00:02:01.661 --> 00:02:03.060
of our first batch of clothes.

00:02:05.901 --> 00:02:07.101
Since you're so concerned

00:02:07.101 --> 00:02:08.221
about your own interests,

00:02:08.541 --> 00:02:09.261
fine.

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:12.101
Whether Yan Studio thrives or fails

00:02:12.341 --> 00:02:12.981
will no longer

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.981
concern you.

00:02:16.541 --> 00:02:17.981
I'll give you one minute to decide.

00:02:19.661 --> 00:02:21.221
If you decide to keep working with me,

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:22.781
then go back.

00:02:24.061 --> 00:02:25.700
And I'll process final payments

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.300
according to contract terms.

00:02:28.261 --> 00:02:29.821
If you decide not to,

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:31.580
I'll pay you right now.

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.821
Yan.

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.020
Look who's here.

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.781
Yan.

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.981
Long time no see.

00:02:54.101 --> 00:02:54.981
What brings you here?

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.860
Sweetie.

00:02:57.341 --> 00:02:58.341
I am

00:02:58.381 --> 00:02:59.700
representing Moscow

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.180
for a Sino-Russian cultural exchange.

00:03:02.941 --> 00:03:04.700
I absolutely adore Yan Studio's dresses.

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:05.541
So,

00:03:05.661 --> 00:03:06.941
I came to visit.

00:03:07.221 --> 00:03:07.860
Of course,

00:03:08.101 --> 00:03:09.381
I came mainly to see you.

00:03:11.781 --> 00:03:13.261
It's an honor to have you.

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.501
Who are they?

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:22.661
They are

00:03:23.501 --> 00:03:24.460
my partners.

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:25.781
Hello.

00:03:26.781 --> 00:03:28.020
I must say

00:03:28.061 --> 00:03:30.180
you've shown excellent judgment

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.580
in choosing to collaborate

00:03:32.661 --> 00:03:33.620
with a sophisticated

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.341
and visionary brand.

00:03:36.061 --> 00:03:36.620
Thanks.

00:03:36.821 --> 00:03:38.180
We're very visionary.

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:39.140
Exactly.

00:03:39.261 --> 00:03:39.860
Visionary.

00:03:39.981 --> 00:03:40.781
Visionary.

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:42.981
You know what?

00:03:43.261 --> 00:03:44.740
In Russia now,

00:03:44.781 --> 00:03:46.460
Chinese-inspired dresses

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.381
are considered the new trend.

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.221
Is international expansion

00:03:51.261 --> 00:03:52.740
part of Yan Studio's

00:03:52.781 --> 00:03:54.061
development plans?

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:55.541
Let me know

00:03:55.541 --> 00:03:56.501
if I can help.

00:03:58.661 --> 00:03:59.101
By the way,

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:00.341
I need

00:04:00.341 --> 00:04:02.700
to attend a high-end closing banquet.

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.541
Must choose a gown from Yan Studio.

00:04:06.061 --> 00:04:06.740
Help me pick one?

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:07.341
No problem.

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:10.020
Our new collection's ready.

00:04:10.501 --> 00:04:11.381
Let me show you.

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.541
Hey.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.901
Leave it to me.

00:04:23.661 --> 00:04:24.180
Okay.

00:04:29.661 --> 00:04:30.141
Hi.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:32.300
Mr. Shen, right?

00:04:32.781 --> 00:04:33.541
Nice to meet you.

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:34.820
Sit.

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:37.781
We've long admired you.

00:04:38.141 --> 00:04:39.380
Your father and you

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:40.541
are role models

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:41.740
for all entrepreneurs.

00:04:42.221 --> 00:04:42.661
Indeed.

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:43.420
Today,

00:04:43.541 --> 00:04:44.701
it's a pleasure

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.420
to meet you.

00:04:47.221 --> 00:04:47.901
Yes, absolutely.

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.901
Me too.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.781
Mr. Shen.

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:51.620
Who is

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:52.940
that lady?

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:55.781
She's the wife

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.901
of a Russian real estate tycoon,

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:59.940
and Ms. Xu's close friend.

00:04:59.981 --> 00:05:01.461
She trusts this studio's potential.

00:05:01.541 --> 00:05:03.021
Perhaps Yan Studio will

00:05:03.101 --> 00:05:05.581
become an officially recognized company

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.221
for cultural promotion.

00:05:08.101 --> 00:05:09.180
Orders will flood in.

00:05:10.021 --> 00:05:11.141
It's true?

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:15.856
It's not easy
for my wife to do business.

00:05:16.221 --> 00:05:17.264
Please look out for her.

00:05:18.021 --> 00:05:19.541
No problem.

00:05:19.781 --> 00:05:21.221
We're all loyal partners

00:05:21.701 --> 00:05:22.940
of Yan Studio.

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:24.781
Mr. Shen.

00:05:25.541 --> 00:05:26.341
Today,

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:27.500
I promise you.

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:29.461
Ms. Xu's business

00:05:29.901 --> 00:05:30.661
is ours.

00:05:30.701 --> 00:05:31.541
You can count on us.

00:05:33.141 --> 00:05:33.781
Thank you.

00:05:35.541 --> 00:05:36.141
Yan.

00:05:37.701 --> 00:05:38.221
Look!

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:39.221
Is it pretty?

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:41.461
I absolutely

00:05:41.461 --> 00:05:42.820
adore the dress you picked for me.

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:43.901
It's perfect!

00:05:44.021 --> 00:05:44.820
So beautiful!

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:47.141
Truly stunning!

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:49.341
Yan,

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:51.901
are you in some kind of trouble?

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:53.701
No.

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.101
Your husband told me everything.

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:59.060
I believe

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:00.820
you'll push through this darkness

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:02.021
and see your rainbow.

00:06:02.781 --> 00:06:04.260
At Yanbo Resort,

00:06:04.581 --> 00:06:06.820
I saw your passion for your career.

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:08.620
Any challenge

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:10.260
won't defeat you.

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:20.620
Those are the most empowering

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:23.541
and comforting words

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:25.541
I've heard recently.

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:29.221
You can do this.

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:30.260
Rest assured,

00:06:31.901 --> 00:06:32.860
I'll do my best

00:06:32.901 --> 00:06:33.904
to overcome the crisis.

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:36.260
I'll keep wearing your designs

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:37.820
and show them to the world.

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:41.141
How long will you stay

00:06:41.221 --> 00:06:42.021
in Jingzhou?

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:44.940
I came with my husband.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:46.300
He is here

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:47.860
for a cross-border collaboration.

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:48.620
For business?

00:06:49.021 --> 00:06:50.541
So, we do our things separately.

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:51.860
By the way,

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:53.300
your husband's company

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:54.541
has been shortlisted

00:06:54.541 --> 00:06:55.420
for a partnership.

00:06:55.661 --> 00:06:57.420
But all candidates undergo

00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:58.740
a three-month evaluation period.

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:02.860
I'll await good news in three months.

00:07:04.901 --> 00:07:06.541
During the evaluation period,

00:07:06.541 --> 00:07:07.860
you must come see me.

00:07:08.141 --> 00:07:09.581
I definitely will!

00:07:11.141 --> 00:07:12.141
Open your arms.

00:07:15.221 --> 00:07:17.820
Get precise measurements taken.

00:07:18.021 --> 00:07:18.701
Again?

00:07:18.781 --> 00:07:19.500
Of course!

00:07:19.541 --> 00:07:20.500
Then you can choose

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:21.740
plenty of styles that suit you.

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:23.101
Sounds great!

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:26.860
Good luck.

00:07:27.461 --> 00:07:27.981
Goodbye.

00:07:28.461 --> 00:07:28.981
Goodbye.

00:07:42.581 --> 00:07:43.420
Thank you for today.

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:47.981
I've heard

00:07:48.341 --> 00:07:49.141
of your situation.

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:51.620
I keep watching you online.

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:54.781
What?

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:56.221
Want to lend me money?

00:07:59.581 --> 00:08:01.060
I won't undermine your principles

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:01.820
or resolutions.

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:04.221
But I must do something.

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:08.420
Hear me out first.

00:08:08.901 --> 00:08:09.620
Look at this.

00:08:10.661 --> 00:08:12.420
This could help get your company

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:13.300
out of crisis.

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:19.141
Qinglan Cup Fashion Design Competition?

00:08:20.901 --> 00:08:22.581
Yao mentioned this before.

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:25.060
It's highly influential

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:26.940
in the design community.

00:08:29.101 --> 00:08:30.661
Major media outlets

00:08:31.101 --> 00:08:32.341
will cover it too.

00:08:32.821 --> 00:08:34.660
Winning this competition would

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:35.500
help you

00:08:36.221 --> 00:08:37.101
gain recognition

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:38.260
from the fashion industry.

00:08:39.181 --> 00:08:40.221
With an award, you will

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:41.660
have a chance to speak,

00:08:42.301 --> 00:08:43.061
show people

00:08:43.181 --> 00:08:44.780
the authentic brocade,

00:08:45.581 --> 00:08:47.260
and restate Yan Studio's philosophy.

00:08:47.941 --> 00:08:48.821
You can tell consumers

00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:51.260
that intangible heritage stuff
is not priceless

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:52.941
but worthwhile.

00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:57.740
Registration has closed already.

00:08:58.941 --> 00:09:00.221
I've already signed you up.

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:02.821
Just submit the company documents
on time,

00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:03.981
along with the photos.

00:09:06.421 --> 00:09:08.301
Am I crossing the line?

00:09:12.941 --> 00:09:14.061
Thank you.

00:09:18.221 --> 00:09:19.181
I really

00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:21.461
appreciate it.

00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:24.821
I won't disturb you.

00:09:25.701 --> 00:09:26.380
I'm leaving.

into two groups.

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:05.701
Meng Zhao and Huanhuan will

00:10:05.701 --> 00:10:07.181

00:10:07.301 --> 00:10:08.020

00:10:09.101 --> 00:10:10.821
with the Qinglan Cup competition.

00:10:10.981 --> 00:10:11.421
Good luck!

00:10:11.581 --> 00:10:12.341
I hope

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:13.740
you can do your best.

00:10:13.981 --> 00:10:15.421
Now, let's have Yao explain

00:10:15.421 --> 00:10:17.221
the concept behind
our competition entries.

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:19.260
For this collection,

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:20.461
I'm planning

00:10:20.461 --> 00:10:21.900
to use traditional handmade fabrics.

00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:23.301
The fabrics

00:10:23.301 --> 00:10:25.380
require Su embroidery techniques.

00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:26.421
These three

00:10:26.421 --> 00:10:28.380
are my preliminary designs.

00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:29.301
The first piece,

00:10:29.301 --> 00:10:30.900
titled Flames,

00:10:30.941 --> 00:10:32.821
uses white

00:10:32.941 --> 00:10:34.860
and red hues

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:36.181
to make a great contrast,

00:10:36.701 --> 00:10:38.260
expressing both elegance

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:39.540
and attraction.

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:41.101
The second one...

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:41.900
We need photographs

00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:42.981
showing front,

00:10:42.981 --> 00:10:43.981
back,

00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:45.260
and side profiles

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:46.981
of each garment.

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:48.821
Ensure structural

00:10:48.821 --> 00:10:50.020
and design integrity,

00:10:50.101 --> 00:10:51.140
and complete accessories.

00:10:51.701 --> 00:10:52.860
Through detailed close-ups,

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:54.101
we must highlight the quality

00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:55.461
and texture of the fabrics

00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:57.181
and the fancy hand craftsmanship.

00:10:57.181 --> 00:10:59.024
♪Cut off malicious labels♪

00:11:00.461 --> 00:11:03.620

Very good!

00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:12.181
You've well mixed traditional fashion

00:11:12.701 --> 00:11:13.821
with modern one.

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:17.061
The detailing is impeccable.

00:11:17.181 --> 00:11:18.660
This is true artisanal craftsmanship.

00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:20.780
Yao, you know what?

00:11:21.101 --> 00:11:22.301
My proudest achievement

00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:23.981
is being your permanent model.

00:11:26.011 --> 00:11:27.530
♪Discard what doesn't fit♪

00:11:27.581 --> 00:11:28.500
What's wrong?

00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:29.981
Why are you crying?

00:11:33.101 --> 00:11:35.140
The stress just got to me.

00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:36.620
Cry if you want to.

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:38.140
Let it all out.

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:39.421
Look,

00:11:40.221 --> 00:11:41.780
my shoulders are yours.

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:44.341
Get out of here!

00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:45.140
Come on.

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:46.941
I'm just emotional

00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:48.421
because of my beautiful designs.

00:11:49.101 --> 00:11:50.020
Unbelievable!

00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:51.701
Who designed this masterpiece?

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:53.740
It's breathtaking!

00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:56.140
Stop it.

00:11:57.221 --> 00:11:58.301
Then Qiao Lin and I...

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:00.540
Can I lean on you, Yan?

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:02.301
I'll go try the outfit.

00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:03.380
Wait a moment.

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:04.941
I'm coming with you.

00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:05.941
Me too.

00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:07.701

Ms. Xu.

00:12:42.061 --> 00:12:43.900
I noticed an accounting irregularity

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.301
while processing payments.

00:12:46.981 --> 00:12:47.620
Take a look.

00:12:50.701 --> 00:12:51.821
This situation

00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:53.221
is completely new to me.

00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:55.380
I usually just

00:12:55.461 --> 00:12:56.341
assist Mr. Dong,

00:12:56.780 --> 00:12:57.540
so I'm unfamiliar

00:12:57.540 --> 00:12:58.740
with the remaining procedures.

00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:00.101
I have no idea

00:13:00.101 --> 00:13:01.020
how to fix this.

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:02.941
Tried to reach Dong?

00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:04.301
Sure.

00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:06.260
But his phone's disconnected.

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:07.740
His WeChat account is deleted.

00:13:08.101 --> 00:13:08.900
He has

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:10.421
crossed the line!

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:11.941
He doesn't want us to find him.

00:13:11.941 --> 00:13:13.020
He's running away.

00:13:15.312 --> 00:13:17.584
(Sold a batch of clothing,
processing fee)

00:13:18.101 --> 00:13:20.140
Mr. Lin once collaborated

00:13:20.181 --> 00:13:22.020
with Mr. Dong

00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:22.900
on work.

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.061
He seemed professional

00:13:25.821 --> 00:13:27.341
and checked the accounting quickly.

00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:28.620
Why don't we

00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:29.900
ask him for help?

00:13:30.461 --> 00:13:31.020
I see.

00:13:31.301 --> 00:13:31.941
You may leave.

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:32.900
Alright, Ms. Xu.

00:13:33.101 --> 00:13:33.860
I'll go back.

00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:46.620
Yan.

00:13:48.421 --> 00:13:49.301
Good idea.

00:13:50.341 --> 00:13:50.821
Can we talk?

00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:51.941
Sure.

00:13:54.101 --> 00:13:55.061
Here is the thing.

00:13:56.101 --> 00:13:56.860
You know

00:13:57.101 --> 00:13:58.821
we've been struggling to hire a CFO.

00:13:59.341 --> 00:14:00.341
The accounting assistant

00:14:00.341 --> 00:14:01.260
has been overwhelmed.

00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:02.821
So she asked me

00:14:03.101 --> 00:14:03.941
if it's possible

00:14:04.701 --> 00:14:07.181
to have Lin Tao temporarily
fill the position.

00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:09.301
Lin Tao?

00:14:09.341 --> 00:14:09.981
It's fine.

00:14:10.061 --> 00:14:11.301
If you have a problem,

00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:12.701
we could actually

00:14:12.701 --> 00:14:13.701
wait a bit longer.

00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:14.941
We'll hire someone anyway.

00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:16.821
No problem. I don't object.

00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:19.181
We can't
leave a finance position vacant.

00:14:19.701 --> 00:14:20.500
It's for business.

00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:25.140
Are you concerned about...?

00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:27.061
No, I'm not worried.

00:14:27.421 --> 00:14:28.860
Lin Tao happens to be unemployed.

00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:30.301
He's got nothing to do.

00:14:30.581 --> 00:14:31.581
This position actually

00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:32.821
suits him well.

00:14:33.061 --> 00:14:33.701
I'll explain

00:14:33.701 --> 00:14:34.701
to Yu Yiming.

00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:35.500
Don't worry.

00:14:36.101 --> 00:14:36.981
Is it really okay?

00:14:37.221 --> 00:14:37.740
Sure.

00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:40.301
Okay.

00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:41.620
Then it's settled.

00:14:41.941 --> 00:14:42.500
I'm leaving.

00:14:47.568 --> 00:14:48.421
(Payment Reminder:
Please settle balance promptly)

00:14:48.421 --> 00:14:49.301
(Sender: Ruibo Fabric Company)
This was received

00:14:49.301 --> 00:14:50.581
yesterday.

00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:52.581
This wasn't

00:14:52.581 --> 00:14:53.620
filed before.

00:14:53.821 --> 00:14:54.701
Mr. Dong

00:14:54.701 --> 00:14:55.860
handled this personally.

00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:57.941
I was completely unaware of it.

00:14:58.341 --> 00:14:59.301
Now,

00:14:59.341 --> 00:15:00.500
he's completely disappeared

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:01.701
and can't be found.

00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:04.461
Don't worry.

00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:09.740
Ruibo Fabric Company?

00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:12.860
Liu.

00:15:13.341 --> 00:15:14.500
I remember

00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:15.581
during our last session,

00:15:15.821 --> 00:15:17.020
there was a receipt

00:15:17.301 --> 00:15:19.020
from the same company.

00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:21.620
Gather all financial records

00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:22.860
of the company.

00:15:23.301 --> 00:15:24.181
Let's recheck them.

00:15:24.421 --> 00:15:25.780
Okay, I'll retrieve them.

00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:27.380
All here.

00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:31.181
Mr. Lin.

00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:32.581
I owe you.

00:15:32.581 --> 00:15:33.860
Thank you so much.

00:15:34.061 --> 00:15:34.821
You actually

00:15:34.821 --> 00:15:36.221
remember a receipt.

00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:38.101
Unexpectedly, it led us to uncover

00:15:38.101 --> 00:15:39.101
such a substantial sum.

00:15:40.061 --> 00:15:40.620
No problem.

00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:42.421
If you have any problems, let me know.

00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:44.020
Finance work is always

00:15:44.301 --> 00:15:44.941
detail-oriented.

00:15:45.181 --> 00:15:46.221
Every detail matters

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:47.101
immensely.

00:15:47.221 --> 00:15:47.780
Understood.

00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:50.181
Ms. Xu.

00:15:50.421 --> 00:15:51.380
It's all settled.

00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:52.740
All thanks to

00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:53.941
Mr. Lin's assistance today.

00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:56.181
Thank you.

00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:57.581
Liu,

00:15:57.981 --> 00:15:58.620
you may leave.

00:15:58.860 --> 00:15:59.941
I'll get back to work.

00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:02.540
Lin Tao.

00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:04.020
It's time to have lunch.

00:16:04.101 --> 00:16:05.500
Join us for lunch?

00:16:05.821 --> 00:16:06.701
I'll pass.

00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:08.221
I'm glad I could help.

00:16:08.461 --> 00:16:09.301
See you.

00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:10.260
Lin Tao.

00:16:12.101 --> 00:16:13.341
Qiao Lin told me

00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:14.701
about your situation.

00:16:15.701 --> 00:16:17.301
Where are you working?

00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:20.461
At the martial arts gym.

00:16:20.981 --> 00:16:21.821
Doing odd jobs.

00:16:22.421 --> 00:16:23.140
Just let me know

00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:24.701
if you have financial matters.

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:27.540
I can be your external consultant.

00:16:29.301 --> 00:16:29.981
Here's the thing.

00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:32.900
Since our CFO

00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:33.821
left his position,

00:16:34.701 --> 00:16:36.260
the role has been vacant.

00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:38.701
So,

00:16:39.701 --> 00:16:41.780
if you want to change your job,

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:43.540
you can join us.

00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:47.260
Me?

00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:49.380
Is that okay?

00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:50.540
Absolutely.

00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:54.341
You understand my company's finances

00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:56.101
and have professional skills.

00:16:56.301 --> 00:16:58.221
Even Liu admires you.

00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:01.221
But for the record,

00:17:01.821 --> 00:17:03.600
there's a three-month probation period.

00:17:04.221 --> 00:17:05.020
If it's okay,

00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:06.100
you can start tomorrow.

00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:08.100
Of course.

00:17:08.461 --> 00:17:09.381
To be honest,

00:17:10.141 --> 00:17:11.060
Qiao Lin knows

00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:13.500
I lost my banking job.

00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:16.020
I don't want to return home

00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:17.008
and upset my parents.

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:18.540
I wanted to stay in Jingzhou

00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:19.580
and find a new job

00:17:19.621 --> 00:17:20.461
before telling them.

00:17:20.661 --> 00:17:22.221
I don't want them to worry about me.

00:17:23.221 --> 00:17:24.020
You should

00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:24.941
call them later

00:17:24.981 --> 00:17:25.701
and reassure them.

00:17:26.701 --> 00:17:28.060
Welcome aboard.

00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:30.020
Welcome.

00:17:31.621 --> 00:17:33.020
Thank you for trusting me.

00:17:33.461 --> 00:17:34.421
I will

00:17:34.461 --> 00:17:35.500
do a good job,

00:17:35.981 --> 00:17:37.381
so you can focus on business

00:17:37.621 --> 00:17:39.100
without worries.

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:40.981
See you tomorrow.

00:17:41.661 --> 00:17:42.141
Okay.

00:17:42.221 --> 00:17:43.340
I'll go get prepared.

00:17:52.701 --> 00:17:53.820
Let's get back

00:17:53.861 --> 00:17:54.780
to where we were.

00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:58.260
When pairing with silver accessories,

00:17:58.300 --> 00:17:59.300
use black eyeshadow.

00:17:59.381 --> 00:17:59.820
Yan.

00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:01.020
Yes?

00:18:01.861 --> 00:18:02.740
Our eligibility

00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:03.621
for the competition

00:18:03.621 --> 00:18:04.340
was revoked.

00:18:05.008 --> 00:18:05.904
(We regret to inform you of your disqualification
from the Qinglan Cup competition.)

00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:13.381
Stop wasting your time here.

00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:14.621
It's pointless.

00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:16.981
Getting Yan Studio requalified

00:18:16.981 --> 00:18:18.141
isn't within my authority.

00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:21.340
Can you help us

00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:22.020
contact

00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:23.381
the person in charge?

00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:24.020
We can

00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:25.181
explain it again

00:18:25.461 --> 00:18:26.941
in detail.

00:18:27.181 --> 00:18:27.941
I assure you

00:18:28.141 --> 00:18:29.100
our clothing quality

00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:30.260
is impeccable.

00:18:31.141 --> 00:18:31.861
You've explained

00:18:31.861 --> 00:18:32.621
clearly enough,

00:18:32.941 --> 00:18:33.941
but the point is,

00:18:33.941 --> 00:18:35.740
explanations aren't enough.

00:18:36.381 --> 00:18:37.141
A contestant

00:18:37.141 --> 00:18:38.381
with ongoing public disputes

00:18:38.381 --> 00:18:39.100
would negatively

00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:40.421
controversial our competition.

00:18:40.941 --> 00:18:42.060
But we're clearly

00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:43.500
the victims of counterfeits!

00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:45.100
How does that make us guilty?

00:18:45.421 --> 00:18:45.981
Miss.

00:18:46.181 --> 00:18:48.020
We've tried our best

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:49.941
to mitigate the negative impact.

00:18:49.941 --> 00:18:51.300
- So...
- But the rumors persist!

00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:53.181
It's provoked gossip,

00:18:53.181 --> 00:18:54.020
true or not.

00:18:54.181 --> 00:18:55.221
Please leave now.

00:18:55.941 --> 00:18:56.381
Miss.

00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:57.020
Wait.

00:18:57.461 --> 00:18:58.181
Please consider.

00:18:58.381 --> 00:18:59.381
Yan Studio

00:18:59.381 --> 00:19:00.780
values cultural heritage.

00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:01.621
We use

00:19:01.621 --> 00:19:02.901
handwoven brocade.

00:19:02.981 --> 00:19:03.740
The counterfeits

00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:04.740
are machine-made.

00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:06.100
You should investigate it!

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:07.701
Why aren't you investigating?

00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:09.701
Miss.

00:19:10.981 --> 00:19:11.981
Miss, here's the thing.

00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:13.981
The reason we persist so strongly

00:19:13.981 --> 00:19:15.100
in joining this competition

00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:16.901
is to seize this chance
to help the public

00:19:17.461 --> 00:19:18.820
distinguish right from wrong.

00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:21.461
This isn't just
about clearing Yan Studio's name

00:19:21.584 --> 00:19:23.901
but also showing respect
for intangible cultural heritage.

00:19:23.901 --> 00:19:24.701
What do you say?

00:19:24.941 --> 00:19:25.701
Clearing your name

00:19:25.701 --> 00:19:27.300
isn't the organizer's obligation.

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:29.661
I've made my position clear.

00:19:29.981 --> 00:19:30.740
I can't

00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:31.580
help you.

00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:32.981
Instead of wasting time here,

00:19:32.981 --> 00:19:34.461
you should focus on damage control.

00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:36.221
Removing your stains matters.

00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:38.580
Chen.

00:19:39.421 --> 00:19:39.820
Come.

00:19:39.941 --> 00:19:40.621
The fifth group.

00:19:51.941 --> 00:19:53.540
Are we really leaving like this?

00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:54.780
We should stay here

00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:56.181
until they give us approval.

00:19:57.020 --> 00:19:58.141
She said we have stains?

00:19:58.621 --> 00:19:59.861
What kind of organizer is that?

00:19:59.901 --> 00:20:00.941
With zero accountability.

00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:02.768
Always dodging responsibility.

00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:07.421
Let's try something else.

00:20:09.181 --> 00:20:10.448
We must join the competition.

00:20:25.621 --> 00:20:26.661
(Qiao Lin)
Yan Studio has been disqualified

00:20:26.661 --> 00:20:27.461
for the competition

00:20:27.461 --> 00:20:28.820
and thinks we would

00:20:28.861 --> 00:20:30.500
negatively impact the competition.

00:20:35.661 --> 00:20:36.221
Mr. Shen.

00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:38.300
Sun Siwei is here.

00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:40.020
She wants to interview you.

00:20:41.181 --> 00:20:42.141
Haven't I already

00:20:42.141 --> 00:20:42.740
declined?

00:20:42.941 --> 00:20:43.340
Fine.

00:20:43.661 --> 00:20:44.421
I'll send her away.

00:20:45.981 --> 00:20:46.421
Wait.

00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:51.300
Have her get ready.

00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:53.260
This is

00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:54.300
an update on the progress

00:20:54.421 --> 00:20:55.580
of the New District project.

00:20:55.780 --> 00:20:56.181
Good.

00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:57.941
Thank you

00:20:57.941 --> 00:20:58.981
for this interview.

00:20:59.421 --> 00:21:00.461
We know you are

00:21:00.461 --> 00:21:01.421
typically low-profile

00:21:01.461 --> 00:21:03.100
and rarely appear

00:21:03.141 --> 00:21:04.020
in the spotlight.

00:21:04.221 --> 00:21:05.381
Making an exception today

00:21:05.381 --> 00:21:06.300
to be interviewed by me

00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:07.221
is my honor.

00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:09.300
Don't overinterpret this.

00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:11.661
I'm not making exceptions for anyone.

00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:15.221
My wife founded Yan Studio

00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:16.621
and faced some complications.

00:21:17.981 --> 00:21:19.100
I learn

00:21:19.661 --> 00:21:21.861
that keeping low-key is good.

00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:24.020
But if overdone,

00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:26.780
it will be bad.

00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:29.181
It makes others overlook

00:21:29.381 --> 00:21:30.340
your strengths.

00:21:31.221 --> 00:21:33.540
My wife originally wanted

00:21:33.621 --> 00:21:34.941
to work quietly.

00:21:34.941 --> 00:21:36.661
She stopped me

00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:37.820
from promoting her brand.

00:21:38.381 --> 00:21:40.340
But in the end,

00:21:41.181 --> 00:21:42.461
some people maliciously

00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:43.901
created knockoffs,

00:21:43.941 --> 00:21:45.060
tarnishing her reputation.

00:21:46.221 --> 00:21:48.060
Yet numerous influencers

00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:49.580
conducted comparisons

00:21:49.621 --> 00:21:51.100
between Yan Studio's clothes

00:21:51.141 --> 00:21:52.461
and the counterfeits.

00:21:52.621 --> 00:21:54.500
Their conclusion showed

00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:55.580
no big differences.

00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:56.100
Perhaps

00:21:56.340 --> 00:21:57.300
the only difference is

00:21:57.300 --> 00:21:58.661
that Yan Studio charges more.

00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:00.060
Many consumers

00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:01.260
felt outraged

00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:03.381
by the result,

00:22:03.461 --> 00:22:03.941
accusing

00:22:04.141 --> 00:22:05.100
Yan Studio

00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:06.861
of treating customers as fools.

00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:08.901
What's your response, Mr. Shen?

00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:11.221
As everyone knows,

00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:13.740
Jinda Group's properties

00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:15.580
never compete through price wars.

00:22:16.941 --> 00:22:19.181
Our construction philosophy ensures

00:22:19.421 --> 00:22:20.981
every brick,

00:22:21.701 --> 00:22:23.020
or every steel beam,

00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:25.181
or even every grain of sand

00:22:25.421 --> 00:22:26.981
meets national standards.

00:22:27.421 --> 00:22:28.500
It's not

00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:30.740
about appearance.

00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:33.540
After enduring a storm,

00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:35.020
property owners will know

00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:35.981
what it means

00:22:36.461 --> 00:22:37.461
to get what they pay for.

00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:39.901
Just like Yan Studio,

00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:43.340
they insist on using handwoven brocade,

00:22:43.941 --> 00:22:45.941
aiming to convey cultural values

00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:47.901
embedded in the craftsmanship.

00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:49.981
Some attention-seeking influencers

00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:51.181
distort facts and claim

00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:52.221
that my wife

00:22:53.181 --> 00:22:54.861
is exploiting nostalgia for profit

00:22:55.861 --> 00:22:57.020
and deceiving consumers.

00:22:57.500 --> 00:22:58.701
That is nonsense.

00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:02.461
May I ask if your statement

00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:03.780
represents Jinda's position?

00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:05.141
Or is this a personal endorsement

00:23:05.141 --> 00:23:06.500
for Yan Studio?

00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:08.901
The public should

00:23:08.901 --> 00:23:09.540
listen to

00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:11.020
Yan Studio.

00:23:12.621 --> 00:23:13.941
Certain malicious individuals

00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:15.020
disregarded truths

00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:16.661
for attention.

00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:18.780
They created the buzz

00:23:18.861 --> 00:23:20.820
to tarnish Yan Studio's reputation.

00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:22.941
This is cyberbullying,

00:23:24.221 --> 00:23:24.941
not justice.

00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:27.260
Understood.

00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:29.780
As a spouse,

00:23:29.941 --> 00:23:32.100
what advice would you give

00:23:32.141 --> 00:23:33.340
your entrepreneurial wife?

00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:35.901
Her vision remains

00:23:35.901 --> 00:23:36.820
remarkably clear.

00:23:36.901 --> 00:23:37.461
Therefore,

00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:39.421
she requires no suggestions from me.

00:23:39.981 --> 00:23:41.461
Instead, I should learn

00:23:41.461 --> 00:23:42.540
about her perseverance

00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:44.100
and composure.

00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:48.500
In this fast-paced world,

00:23:48.901 --> 00:23:51.221
my wife deliberately chose

00:23:51.221 --> 00:23:52.861
labor-intensive handmade textiles.

00:23:53.381 --> 00:23:54.381
(She knew)

00:23:54.381 --> 00:23:55.461
(this path would be tough.)

00:23:56.221 --> 00:23:57.981
(Yet she leads her team)

00:23:58.540 --> 00:23:59.661
(into rural villages,)

00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:01.901
(realizing production)

00:24:01.981 --> 00:24:03.221
(of the embroidery,)

00:24:04.381 --> 00:24:05.621
(and giving local women)

00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:06.941
(many jobs to do.)

00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:09.020
(Their husbands working outside)

00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:10.500
(may return home)

00:24:11.181 --> 00:24:12.500
(and live with their families)

00:24:12.901 --> 00:24:14.181
(and children.)

00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:16.300
(Children won't be left behind.)

00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:18.300
(My wife is)

00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:19.421
(doing a meaningful career)

00:24:19.621 --> 00:24:21.181
(with compassion.)

00:24:23.861 --> 00:24:24.981

Hello?

00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:02.661
Is this Yan Studio?

00:29:04.141 --> 00:29:05.221
Yes, who is this?

00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:08.240
This is the organizer
of the Qinglan Cup.

00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:10.221
We have

00:29:10.221 --> 00:29:11.941
received many public requests

00:29:11.941 --> 00:29:13.941
to requalify Yan Studio

00:29:13.941 --> 00:29:15.300
for the competition.

00:29:15.941 --> 00:29:16.780
After deliberation,

00:29:16.901 --> 00:29:18.221
we decided

00:29:18.221 --> 00:29:19.300
to requalify Yan Studio.

00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:24.260
Thank you.

00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:26.701
When choosing partners,

00:29:27.181 --> 00:29:28.901
I value more than just business acumen.

00:29:29.661 --> 00:29:32.661
I also assess his character
and attitude towards family members.

00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:34.421
My wife mentioned

00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:36.100
Yan Studio has encountered difficulties.

00:29:36.661 --> 00:29:38.500
What impressed me was your approach.

00:29:38.941 --> 00:29:40.820
As a husband,
you silently supported your wife

00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:43.381
without overshadowing her brilliance.

00:29:43.701 --> 00:29:44.820
That's truly commendable.

00:29:45.901 --> 00:29:46.540
You flatter me.

00:29:48.181 --> 00:29:48.820
Actually,

00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:50.740
what made me decide

00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:52.421
to partner with Jinda Group

00:29:52.901 --> 00:29:54.100
was seeing how wisely

00:29:54.221 --> 00:29:55.820
you manage your marriage

00:29:56.941 --> 00:29:59.020
and your wife's relentless drive

00:29:59.141 --> 00:30:00.500
to succeed.

00:30:00.941 --> 00:30:01.580
Mr. Shen.

00:30:02.421 --> 00:30:04.020
After our interactions,

00:30:04.141 --> 00:30:05.861
I'm satisfied with Jinda's strength

00:30:05.941 --> 00:30:06.941
and sincerity.

00:30:08.421 --> 00:30:09.661
Jinda also highly values

00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:10.701
this collaboration.

00:30:11.941 --> 00:30:12.421
Good.

00:30:13.981 --> 00:30:15.340
Before the evaluation period ends,

00:30:15.381 --> 00:30:16.701
maintain your current performance

00:30:17.701 --> 00:30:18.740
and don't let me down.

00:30:19.421 --> 00:30:19.861
Sure.

00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:21.740
By the way,

00:30:21.941 --> 00:30:23.461
Sophia loved the dress

00:30:23.461 --> 00:30:24.981
from Ms. Xu.

00:30:25.661 --> 00:30:26.981
It put her in the spotlight.

00:30:28.221 --> 00:30:29.621
Yan is happy

00:30:29.901 --> 00:30:31.260
that her aesthetic sense

00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:32.528
earns Sophia's approval.

00:30:32.981 --> 00:30:33.461
Alright.

00:30:34.461 --> 00:30:34.901
Take care.

00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:35.621

00:31:09.981 --> 00:31:10.941

00:31:21.421 --> 00:31:22.820
I'm genuinely here to help.

Since we met,

00:31:25.020 --> 00:31:25.981
I'll make it clear

00:31:26.221 --> 00:31:27.020
to you.

00:31:29.861 --> 00:31:30.960
Qiao Lin already told me.

00:31:37.461 --> 00:31:38.340
I'm truly sorry.

00:31:38.701 --> 00:31:40.260
They need an accountant,

00:31:40.740 --> 00:31:41.780
and I can be.

00:31:42.181 --> 00:31:42.820
Also,

00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:46.981

00:31:53.260 --> 00:31:53.981
hit me.

00:31:54.181 --> 00:31:54.820
I'll take it.

00:32:09.381 --> 00:32:11.461
You're not holding it against me?

00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:14.181
I hope you'll contribute to Yan Studio.

00:32:17.461 --> 00:32:18.861
I hope you'll keep your word.

00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:42.020

00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:43.020
clarify things with him.

00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:44.181

So why...

00:37:23.821 --> 00:37:25.540
Why didn't it move you?

00:37:44.020 --> 00:37:46.100
Are you unsatisfied

00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:47.020
with this runway show?

00:37:47.461 --> 00:37:48.620
Or do you have no confidence

00:37:48.941 --> 00:37:49.741
in yourself?

00:37:49.741 --> 00:37:50.540
Absolutely not.

00:37:51.381 --> 00:37:52.861
I'm very confident in myself.

00:37:53.901 --> 00:37:55.461
I'm even more confident in Yan Studio.

00:37:58.261 --> 00:37:59.261
Within such a short time,

00:37:59.261 --> 00:38:00.140
we've optimized

00:38:00.540 --> 00:38:05.341
the lighting, stage design, music,
models, and overall tone

00:38:05.981 --> 00:38:07.060
to perfection.

00:38:07.821 --> 00:38:08.821
Everything now

00:38:08.821 --> 00:38:09.660
looks perfect.

00:38:12.341 --> 00:38:13.660
I have watched

00:38:13.660 --> 00:38:14.741
today's full rehearsal.

00:38:15.261 --> 00:38:16.341
During the presentation,

00:38:17.060 --> 00:38:19.461
the outfits are stunning,
and the sets are good.

00:38:20.020 --> 00:38:21.100
Everything's excellent,

00:38:21.341 --> 00:38:22.981
yet there's an emptiness.

00:38:23.981 --> 00:38:25.821
Like there's no connection between them.

00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:28.381
As you said,

00:38:28.901 --> 00:38:29.741
it didn't move me.

00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:32.341
The missing connection

00:38:32.381 --> 00:38:34.180
refers to emotional resonance, right?

00:38:35.781 --> 00:38:36.180
Exactly.

00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:38.060
I want audiences

00:38:38.981 --> 00:38:40.620
and judges to not only appreciate

00:38:41.261 --> 00:38:41.981
the craftsmanship

00:38:41.981 --> 00:38:43.100
in our collection,

00:38:44.180 --> 00:38:45.941
but also feel the stories

00:38:46.901 --> 00:38:48.620
behind these garments.

00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:55.461
I only understand architecture.

00:38:56.861 --> 00:38:58.981
But I know
every creator's original intention

00:38:59.220 --> 00:39:00.421
stems

00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:03.180
from the simplest,

00:39:03.741 --> 00:39:04.861
most fundamental hope.

00:39:05.261 --> 00:39:06.381
They're emotionally driven.

00:39:06.781 --> 00:39:07.821
For example,

00:39:08.821 --> 00:39:09.861
the Potala Palace

00:39:10.901 --> 00:39:12.580
was built by Songtsen Gampo

00:39:12.700 --> 00:39:14.620
for Princess Wencheng.

00:39:14.861 --> 00:39:15.381
Of course,

00:39:15.421 --> 00:39:17.540
there are
many similar architectural wonders.

00:39:17.700 --> 00:39:19.020
The runway setup

00:39:19.301 --> 00:39:20.540
creates spatial layers

00:39:20.660 --> 00:39:22.100
through dimensional design.

00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:24.941
It visually conveys beauty

00:39:25.461 --> 00:39:26.421
and evokes emotions.

00:39:27.261 --> 00:39:28.060
But things like this

00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:29.901
can't impart souls

00:39:29.941 --> 00:39:30.741
or emotions.

00:39:32.981 --> 00:39:34.180
Do you remember

00:39:35.060 --> 00:39:36.461
when you started Yan Studio,

00:39:36.981 --> 00:39:38.461
what moved you most?

00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:46.941
Yao once mentioned

00:39:49.461 --> 00:39:50.941
that every Yi girl,

00:39:51.660 --> 00:39:52.741
in the whole process

00:39:53.540 --> 00:39:54.301
of growth,

00:39:54.301 --> 00:39:55.500
at every significant stage,

00:39:56.660 --> 00:39:57.700
has gifts.

00:39:58.341 --> 00:39:59.700
Their families craft

00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:03.060
special outfits
and dazzling headpieces for them.

00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:06.261
Every stitch

00:40:08.220 --> 00:40:10.261
carries their love for their children.

00:40:11.580 --> 00:40:12.140
Good.

00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:14.540
It's something

00:40:14.660 --> 00:40:15.901
that can resonate with people.

00:40:16.981 --> 00:40:17.821
In the finals,

00:40:17.901 --> 00:40:18.660
all teams

00:40:18.660 --> 00:40:20.180
showcase technical perfection.

00:40:20.941 --> 00:40:23.060
We'll focus on raw emotionality

00:40:23.660 --> 00:40:24.781
for the runway presentation.

00:40:39.301 --> 00:40:41.381
Grandmothers pass craftsmanship
to mothers,

00:40:42.020 --> 00:40:43.461
mothers to daughters.

00:40:44.901 --> 00:40:45.901
It's heritage

00:40:48.821 --> 00:40:49.700
and evolution.

00:40:53.381 --> 00:40:55.421
It's the bloodline connecting

00:40:57.741 --> 00:40:59.381
craftspeople to the craftsmanship.

00:41:13.741 --> 00:41:14.381
Hello?

00:41:14.781 --> 00:41:15.700
Are you home?

00:41:16.580 --> 00:41:17.580
Can you gather everyone

00:41:17.580 --> 00:41:18.741
for a meeting at the office?

00:41:19.341 --> 00:41:20.781
I need to modify our strategy.

00:41:21.180 --> 00:41:21.540
Got it.

00:41:22.341 --> 00:41:22.981
Appreciate it.

00:41:37.700 --> 00:41:38.341
Thank you.

00:41:41.301 --> 00:41:41.968
I'll drive you.

00:41:42.981 --> 00:41:43.461
Okay.

00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:55.280
Blending tradition with modernity,

00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:57.060
(Yan Studio reveals
neo-Chinese aesthetics)

00:41:57.060 --> 00:41:58.576
(rooted in ethnic cultural essence.)

00:41:58.576 --> 00:41:59.620
(Due to the counterfeits,)

00:41:59.620 --> 00:42:00.660
(the brand)

00:42:00.821 --> 00:42:01.540
(once faced)

00:42:01.540 --> 00:42:03.020
(a devastating impact)

00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:04.341
(that damaged its reputation)

00:42:04.341 --> 00:42:05.821
(and consumer trust.)

00:42:06.060 --> 00:42:08.220
(However, through this competition,)

00:42:08.301 --> 00:42:09.741
(they've demonstrated)

00:42:09.741 --> 00:42:11.981
(a unique design philosophy
and commercial success.)

00:42:12.100 --> 00:42:13.020
(Meanwhile,)

00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:14.620
(they gained acclaim,)

00:42:14.861 --> 00:42:16.261
(won the Commercial Value Award,)

00:42:16.301 --> 00:42:18.620
(and achieved miraculous sales growth.)

00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:19.540
Cheers.

00:42:21.941 --> 00:42:22.700
Guys.

00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:24.660
Right now,

00:42:24.901 --> 00:42:25.981
let Ms. Xu

00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:27.781
speak.

00:42:28.741 --> 00:42:29.580
Welcome.

00:42:32.981 --> 00:42:33.500
Alright.

00:42:33.741 --> 00:42:34.861
On behalf

00:42:35.461 --> 00:42:36.341
of Yan Studio,

00:42:36.381 --> 00:42:37.620
I'm speaking.

00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:39.620
This journey

00:42:39.620 --> 00:42:40.901
has been challenging.

00:42:42.220 --> 00:42:43.461
I think

00:42:44.220 --> 00:42:45.660
we're all aware of that.

00:42:46.781 --> 00:42:49.140
Yan Studio's success

00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:50.981
belongs to

00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:52.821
every team member here.

00:42:53.060 --> 00:42:53.861
Thank you all.

00:42:58.421 --> 00:42:59.180
What's more,

00:42:59.461 --> 00:43:01.781
special gratitude goes

00:43:03.620 --> 00:43:04.540
to someone.

00:43:06.941 --> 00:43:08.421
Well,

00:43:10.020 --> 00:43:11.421
in the lowest moments

00:43:11.421 --> 00:43:12.540
of Yan Studio,

00:43:12.540 --> 00:43:13.580
he backed us up

00:43:15.301 --> 00:43:17.261
and gave us strength.

00:43:21.381 --> 00:43:22.580
Thank you, Mr. Liang.

00:43:24.741 --> 00:43:25.941
That's our first investor.

00:43:26.020 --> 00:43:27.220
Thank you, Mr. Liang.

00:43:27.821 --> 00:43:31.821
- Mr. Liang.
- Mr. Liang.

00:43:32.421 --> 00:43:33.140
Listen,

00:43:33.821 --> 00:43:34.781
I'll continue investing.

00:43:35.180 --> 00:43:36.140
The amount will double.

00:43:38.180 --> 00:43:39.781
In the coming days, Yan Studio and I

00:43:39.941 --> 00:43:40.700
will advance

00:43:40.821 --> 00:43:41.901
together.

00:43:42.781 --> 00:43:43.381
Also,

00:43:44.381 --> 00:43:45.461
after drinking,

00:43:45.981 --> 00:43:47.020
we'll have a lucky draw.

00:43:47.020 --> 00:43:48.301
No cap on the prize money!

00:43:50.020 --> 00:43:50.620
Cheers!

00:43:50.781 --> 00:43:54.301
Thank you, Mr. Liang.

00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:55.261
Thank you.

00:43:55.461 --> 00:43:56.060
Thank you.

00:43:56.060 --> 00:43:56.781
So exciting!

00:43:59.500 --> 00:44:00.540
There's prize money.

00:44:02.020 --> 00:44:02.781
Listen.

00:44:02.821 --> 00:44:03.700
There's prize money.

00:44:06.781 --> 00:44:08.341
The renowned Spanish designer

00:44:08.580 --> 00:44:09.060
Ivan

00:44:10.100 --> 00:44:10.981
saw your performance

00:44:11.020 --> 00:44:12.341
at the Qinglan Cup competition

00:44:12.381 --> 00:44:13.220
and showed interest.

00:44:13.901 --> 00:44:14.901
His assistant called me,

00:44:15.180 --> 00:44:16.500
saying Ivan wants to meet you.

00:44:18.421 --> 00:44:19.540
What's that? Is it good?

00:44:19.580 --> 00:44:20.140
Get me one.

00:44:21.421 --> 00:44:23.020
I'll inform them later.

00:44:24.140 --> 00:44:25.580
So what should we prepare?

00:44:26.700 --> 00:44:27.301
Samples,

00:44:27.381 --> 00:44:28.781
and have all documents ready.

00:44:29.941 --> 00:44:31.700
I think to show our

00:44:31.700 --> 00:44:32.381
sincerity,

00:44:33.540 --> 00:44:34.461
you should learn some

00:44:34.461 --> 00:44:35.220
Spanish.

00:44:35.341 --> 00:44:36.220
Definitely.

00:44:36.461 --> 00:44:37.341
Cheers!

00:44:37.901 --> 00:44:39.381
I'll find a tutor.

00:44:39.781 --> 00:44:40.580
No need.

00:44:40.580 --> 00:44:41.341
I'll teach you.

00:44:42.261 --> 00:44:43.020
It's easy.

00:44:43.060 --> 00:44:44.100
Hello. Thank you.

00:44:44.580 --> 00:44:45.741
It's an honor to meet you.

00:44:46.580 --> 00:44:47.440
Say hi in Spanish.

00:44:48.301 --> 00:44:49.220

00:44:49.941 --> 00:44:50.461
