00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.560
What are you thinking?

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.690
Hey.
You said we'd be honest with each other.

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:27.380
I was thinking what if I hurt you.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.760
We haven't even started dating,
yet you're thinking of that?

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:35.480
Because we are different.

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.930
No one is the same.

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:40.560
When different people meet,

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.570
you can only call it love
if you quarrel and stumble along.

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.060
Don't think too much.

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.070
If you like me,
then just like me.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.920
What's going on?
Why are your hands so cold?

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.070
Don't do that.

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.580
Why? Is it giving you butterflies?

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.870
Hyung.

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.520
Do you want to go see the stars with me?

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.690
Where are you going after moving out?

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.260
I'm going to move into the dorm.

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.020
Then, I'm thinking about going on a trip
during semester breaks.

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:37.690
Where to?

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.550
Anywhere.

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.500
I've always dreamed of
going backpacking abroad

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.320
when I get into university.

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.590
Oh, right. Do you want to go together?

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.590
I can't go abroad.

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.150
Wh-Why?

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.540
Did you commit a crime?

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.840
What are you thinking?

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.240
Oh.

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.040
What's wrong?

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.280
The bracelet. It's missing.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.210
The bracelet?

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:23.610
I bought it
thinking about giving it to you.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.300
I found it!

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:43.430
Dongha!

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:46.340
Are you okay?

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.420
It seems rusty.

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:15.250
Hyung, it hurts.

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.600
That's enough.

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.120
What's going on? Come to your senses.

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.720
Hyung, it's me. It's me.

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.470
Lee Joowon!

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:58.980
I was thinking what if I hurt you.

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.860
Because we are different.

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:11.300
Lee Joowon!

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:12.960
Dongha!

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.020
Lee Joowon!

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.120
Dongha!

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.550
Dongha!

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:18.470
Han Dongha!

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:21.620
Are you sure you heard it right?

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.110
I heard something from around here.

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:29.570
The smell of blood...

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:38.440
Don't go, hyung.

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:44.490
Don't you get it?

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.050
You'll be in danger if you're with me.

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:50.000
I'll decide whether it's dangerous or not.

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.570
You almost died because of me just now.

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:54.390
But I didn't die.

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:55.380
Hey, Han Dongha!

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:58.050
You said you liked me!

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.080
So...

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:08.160
Explain what just happened.

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:17.980
You saw me drinking your blood.

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:23.830
What more do you need me to explain?

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:31.340
That's why I'm against you moving in.

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:32.630
You get it?

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:34.900
You didn't want to get hurt, right?

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:40.260
You're not afraid
that I'll find out about this,

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.010
but that I'd leave you to be alone

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:44.900
and that you'd get hurt.

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:52.260
But...

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:56.180
even so, I still like you.

00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:59.180
What should I do?

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.910
But I don't.

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:38.110
Enough.

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:43.390
I said enough!

00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:46.720
Are you addicted to
working out or something? So darn noisy.

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:57.630
Has our house always been this quiet?

00:07:57.630 --> 00:07:59.280
Right.

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:01.150
It was quite lively when Dongha was here.

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:02.660
What is Joowon doing?

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:05.280
No idea. He's just holing up in his room.

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:06.260
What about Seonjae?

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.530
He hasn't been home for days.

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:14.640
What do you think Dongha...
is doing right now?

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:19.610
He must be mad at us.

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:22.680
Dongha.

00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:33.250
Are you okay?

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:36.950
Are you also vampires?

00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:43.830
Seems like I'm right.

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:46.350
Dongha.

00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:49.030
So you agreed to let me move in

00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:51.530
because you needed my blood?

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:05.380
I've always treated you as my family.

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:10.240
I guess I was wrong.

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:20.870
I should've stopped
that thought at the start.

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:22.930
I don't actually want to drink his blood.

00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:24.600
Really?

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:28.280
You said that we could get addicted to it.

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:29.420
You believed that?

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:30.890
Of course.

00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:34.090
What if you follow him wherever he goes?

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:37.650
Why would I like someone like you...

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:39.890
What do you mean?

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:41.860
Nothing.

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:49.270
I want to eat the toast Dongha makes.

00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:51.080
Why was that so delicious?

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:53.840
It was human food too.

00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:26.900
Lee Joowon!

00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:42.860
Don't go, hyung.

00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:45.150
You almost died because of me.

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:49.730
No... That wasn't you.

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:56.360
Don't you get it?

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:58.280
You almost died because of me just now.

00:10:58.280 --> 00:10:59.190
But I didn't die.

00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:00.110
Hey, Han Dongha!

00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:02.910
You said you liked me!

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:08.010
Can you just explain?

00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:17.910
I'm busy. Why did you call me?

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:25.640
I just missed you
since I haven't seen you for a long time.

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:28.030
Are you... sick?

00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:30.260
Wait.

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:34.110
This is a sample.

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:38.300
Try it.

00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:43.820
With this, we don't have to
drink human blood anymore?

00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:48.860
Well... there's no perfect replacement
in this world.

00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:51.790
We can only continue developing them.

00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:58.950
Lee Joowon will be the happiest.

00:11:58.950 --> 00:12:02.460
Why are you
talking about Lee Joowon again?

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:06.320
Right.

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:08.610
Oh, yes.

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:12.320
Did you bring the thing
I asked you to bring?

00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:18.080
Here.

00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:24.380
But why do you want this?

00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:27.440
I think someone needs this very much.

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:35.660
Are you okay?

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:38.500
No.

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:41.750
Then why do that?

00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:49.670
Because... someone said I'm a good person.

00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:52.980
But...

00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:55.390
I think you're really a good person.

00:12:56.810 --> 00:12:58.020
Me?

00:12:58.870 --> 00:13:00.510
Yes.

00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:03.540
It's obvious when someone's a good person.

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:06.950
I've never heard someone say that before.

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:12.220
That's why I want to become one.

00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:18.400
How is there not a single star?

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:25.080
What are you looking at?

00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:29.080
Where did you go?
What have you been doing?

00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:31.360
Are you worried about me?

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:35.550
I should have disappeared
for a few more days.

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:45.880
I went to be sad for a few days.

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:47.780
After all, I went through a breakup.

00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:49.280
Are you talking about me?

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:51.910
Is there anyone else here?

00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:57.230
I'm sorry.

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:00.230
You regret it, right?

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:03.820
That you didn't hold Dongha back.

00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:06.140
No.

00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:09.560
I think I did the right thing.

00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:15.840
I did the right thing.

00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:18.640
And?

00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:22.700
I lied even at the very last moment.

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:26.790
He always showed me his everything,

00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:30.140
but I never told him the truth

00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:32.090
'cause I was too timid.

00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:41.450
Good for you.

00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:54.750
Humans have this game

00:14:54.750 --> 00:14:56.700
called Truth or Dare.

00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:58.500
And?

00:14:59.350 --> 00:15:02.250
Playing the game is an excuse.

00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:04.890
It's just an excuse to tell the truth.

00:15:04.890 --> 00:15:06.170
Who goes first?

00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:08.240
You go first.

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:10.120
I'll go first then.

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:15.570
I'm going to give up.

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:19.020
I thought about it.

00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:22.370
I don't think you deserve me.

00:15:24.810 --> 00:15:26.640
Now it's your turn.

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:39.170
I...

00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:46.460
miss him.

00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:07.890
Then go see him.

Thanks.
