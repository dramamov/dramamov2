WEBVTT

00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:05.422
If we'd gotten closer back then,
I wonder how things would be now?

00:00:05.505 --> 00:00:08.008
Maybe we'd still be close.
Or Mama would still be alive.

00:00:08.091 --> 00:00:09.175
What do you mean?

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:11.594
If I hadn't followed
you that night you snuck out…

00:00:11.678 --> 00:00:13.763
I would've gone home with her.

00:00:13.847 --> 00:00:15.306
Ugh, I hate this killer!

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:16.641
I think that will change things.

00:00:16.725 --> 00:00:20.437
Because you told me
to not burden myself with regret.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.064
Ma…! Patpat is still not here?

00:00:23.148 --> 00:00:26.192
I'll figure out what
you're hiding, Olivia.

00:00:26.276 --> 00:00:28.528
Tell me the truth.
What is Kai planning to do?

00:00:28.611 --> 00:00:31.781
H-He'll go meet up with Bella.

00:00:31.865 --> 00:00:34.951
and they're going to elope.

00:00:35.035 --> 00:00:36.536
Kai! What happened?

00:00:36.619 --> 00:00:37.871
Where's Bella?

00:01:36.137 --> 00:01:39.057
Kai, you have to tell me where Bella is.

00:01:39.474 --> 00:01:41.017
Her family will worry even more

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.269
when they find out
she went missing while with us.

00:01:45.855 --> 00:01:47.065
{\an8}

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.859
{\an8}Maybe she didn't really go missing.

00:01:52.946 --> 00:01:54.155
{\an8}You know…

00:01:55.281 --> 00:01:56.741
{\an8}Maybe she left him.

00:02:03.373 --> 00:02:04.874
{\an8}She didn't leave me.

00:02:07.752 --> 00:02:11.756
{\an8}I'm the one who
failed to keep our promise.

00:02:13.091 --> 00:02:14.717
{\an8}

00:02:17.887 --> 00:02:20.056
{\an8}

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.517
{\an8}When Miss Mia saw us earlier,

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.644
{\an8}I thought she would try to stop us.

00:02:25.145 --> 00:02:27.147
{\an8}I can't believe she even gave us money.

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.857
{\an8}Who'd have expected that?

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.360
{\an8}I can't believe she
supports us running off together.

00:02:34.112 --> 00:02:35.238
{\an8}Yeah.

00:02:36.573 --> 00:02:40.118
{\an8}I thought we'd break up.

00:02:40.201 --> 00:02:41.619
{\an8}

00:02:41.703 --> 00:02:47.750
{\an8}

00:02:47.834 --> 00:02:48.960
{\an8}Kai?

00:02:50.503 --> 00:02:51.629
{\an8}Hey.

00:02:52.213 --> 00:02:54.674
{\an8}Is there something wrong?

00:02:54.757 --> 00:03:00.054
{\an8}

00:03:00.138 --> 00:03:01.347
{\an8}Bella…

00:03:04.517 --> 00:03:06.728
{\an8}I think it's wrong for us to elope.

00:03:09.606 --> 00:03:10.732
{\an8}Wrong?

00:03:11.733 --> 00:03:13.359
{\an8}How is that wrong?

00:03:14.652 --> 00:03:16.863
{\an8}Kai, this is what you want, right?

00:03:18.031 --> 00:03:19.949
{\an8}Kai, now is the right time.

00:03:20.033 --> 00:03:21.326
{\an8}This is it.

00:03:22.327 --> 00:03:24.537
{\an8}This is our chance.

00:03:24.621 --> 00:03:27.415
Kai, now we can get
away from all of them.

00:03:27.498 --> 00:03:29.500
We can now get away from Papa.

00:03:29.584 --> 00:03:31.586
Kai, no one will get in our way anymore.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.840
That's just it, Bella…

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.346
Given my current condition…

00:03:44.474 --> 00:03:46.100
I still can't give you a good life.

00:03:51.105 --> 00:03:52.523
Last night…

00:03:53.816 --> 00:03:55.443
When I smelled the alcohol.

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:03.618
I wanted to drink it so badly!

00:04:07.372 --> 00:04:09.582
Good thing you stopped me.

00:04:09.666 --> 00:04:10.750
Kai.

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:15.129
That's why we need to be together, Kai.

00:04:16.047 --> 00:04:17.966
When we're together,

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:20.843
I can stop you from drinking alcohol.

00:04:20.927 --> 00:04:22.053
Right?

00:04:25.056 --> 00:04:26.140
Bella.

00:04:31.396 --> 00:04:32.897
I want to take care of you.

00:04:35.108 --> 00:04:36.859
But before I can do that…

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.655
I need to deal with
my alcohol problem first.

00:04:40.738 --> 00:04:42.407
I'll get better.

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:43.950
I'll finish my treatment.

00:04:46.202 --> 00:04:47.620
If you can wait for me…

00:04:50.331 --> 00:04:51.499
…Bella…

00:04:53.084 --> 00:04:55.461
I'll take care of
you for the rest of your life.

00:05:20.737 --> 00:05:23.406
And after that…

00:05:24.198 --> 00:05:27.160
I took her to the stop
so she could go home.

00:05:27.618 --> 00:05:30.413
I told her to message
you as soon as she gets home.

00:05:33.916 --> 00:05:35.251
Alright.

00:05:36.127 --> 00:05:40.465
Take a shower in our bathroom.
We'll leave once you're ready, okay?

00:05:54.437 --> 00:05:56.064
Stupid.

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:00.276
You knew they were running off,
but you didn't tell me.

00:06:00.359 --> 00:06:03.362
You don't want them together.
Why should I bother telling you?

00:06:04.447 --> 00:06:06.240
They were already far
away from their families.

00:06:06.324 --> 00:06:08.910
- I even gave them money.
- You shouldn't have done that.

00:06:08.993 --> 00:06:10.328
I did it for love.

00:06:10.411 --> 00:06:12.580
So they can love each
other somewhere far away.

00:06:12.663 --> 00:06:14.332
But what did he do?

00:06:14.415 --> 00:06:16.292
He broke up with his girlfriend.

00:06:22.507 --> 00:06:25.927
He set her free, because he loves her.

00:06:27.136 --> 00:06:29.764
How can a couple love each
other and still end up breaking up?

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:32.517
It doesn't make sense to me.

00:06:33.518 --> 00:06:36.896
Mia, sometimes you have
to let go of someone you love

00:06:37.522 --> 00:06:38.940
for their own good.

00:06:39.649 --> 00:06:41.275
I don't accept that.

00:06:43.653 --> 00:06:46.781
That will never happen to us.

00:06:48.658 --> 00:06:50.451
I will never let you go,

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:52.787
my safety pin.

00:07:11.097 --> 00:07:12.390
Matmat.

00:07:13.349 --> 00:07:16.644
You didn't eat much earlier
because you kept checking your phone.

00:07:18.187 --> 00:07:20.523
Hmm. No.

00:07:20.898 --> 00:07:22.358
Because…

00:07:23.067 --> 00:07:24.735
Patpat called.

00:07:25.611 --> 00:07:27.363
Did you call him back?

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:29.449
Mm-hmm, but nothing.

00:07:29.532 --> 00:07:33.453
I can't reach him. He won't answer.

00:07:34.704 --> 00:07:37.832
Maybe he has no signal?
He must be on his way home.

00:07:39.542 --> 00:07:40.835
- Gemma?
- Oh?

00:07:40.918 --> 00:07:41.919
Any update?

00:07:42.545 --> 00:07:45.798
Nope. Kai hasn't called yet either.

00:07:46.757 --> 00:07:48.801
Maybe he called Patrick.

00:07:48.885 --> 00:07:53.598
Patpat won't pick up.
Matmat has already called him,

00:07:53.973 --> 00:07:55.808
27 times.

00:07:56.434 --> 00:07:59.479
Alright.
I'll try calling the other nurses.

00:08:00.313 --> 00:08:01.522
Okay, thanks.

00:08:05.067 --> 00:08:09.655
Matmat, are you going
to be able to work on your mural?

00:08:16.245 --> 00:08:17.538
Don't worry.

00:08:17.622 --> 00:08:20.166
You'll speak to Patrick later.

00:08:20.249 --> 00:08:21.250
Hmm?

00:08:23.669 --> 00:08:24.837
I'll be right over here.

00:08:48.611 --> 00:08:50.571
- Bro?
- Hmm?

00:08:50.655 --> 00:08:54.742
Thank you, and sorry for the trouble.

00:08:55.326 --> 00:08:58.454
I know you don't have work today,

00:08:58.538 --> 00:09:01.541
but you still came to help me.

00:09:04.001 --> 00:09:06.712
What matters is you came back.

00:09:08.714 --> 00:09:12.343
Sorry for the trouble too, Miss Mia.

00:09:14.845 --> 00:09:18.891
Bro, I promise to focus on my recovery.

00:09:18.975 --> 00:09:21.852
I'll do whatever
treatment my doctor advises.

00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:23.771
As you should.

00:09:24.605 --> 00:09:26.148
Go on.

00:09:26.232 --> 00:09:28.526
I'll make it up to you, bro.

00:09:28.609 --> 00:09:29.694
Thanks!

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.283
Let's go?

00:09:39.328 --> 00:09:41.539
Matmat might be inside. Let me go check.

00:09:42.415 --> 00:09:43.583
Alright.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.126
I'll stay here.

00:09:46.294 --> 00:09:47.545
I'll wait for you.

00:09:57.263 --> 00:09:59.056
Go help Kyla change.

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:00.766
- Alright.
- Okay, thank you.

00:10:07.398 --> 00:10:09.150
Mark's safe for now.

00:10:09.942 --> 00:10:12.570
Good thing Samuel
was transferred to my care.

00:10:14.905 --> 00:10:17.867
I won't let your words affect me, Olivia.

00:10:18.451 --> 00:10:22.288
You need to reevaluate your system, Eden.

00:10:22.371 --> 00:10:23.456
Why?

00:10:25.499 --> 00:10:26.834
Should I be like you?

00:10:26.917 --> 00:10:30.921
Should I feed the patients
food from outside the hospital?

00:10:35.009 --> 00:10:36.010
Hmm?

00:10:37.928 --> 00:10:41.849
Why do you want
Samuel to be your patient so badly?

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:47.480
You said it yourself,
mind your own business.

00:10:47.563 --> 00:10:50.191
Olivia, I'm calling you out

00:10:50.274 --> 00:10:53.319
because you are going against the rules.

00:10:53.402 --> 00:10:56.197
- What if you're poisoning--
- I would never do that!

00:10:59.867 --> 00:11:01.535
I'm warning you, Olivia.

00:11:03.621 --> 00:11:05.414
I told you,

00:11:06.415 --> 00:11:08.668
I see everything.

00:11:09.669 --> 00:11:12.296
You can't hide anything from me. Hmm?

00:11:27.645 --> 00:11:29.397
- I got it.
- Kai…

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:34.026
Kai, at least you got
to see Bella for one night.

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:39.240
And you were able to stay sober!

00:11:39.949 --> 00:11:43.202
It was hard to resist, Mister Tommy.

00:11:43.285 --> 00:11:47.832
Mia left the liquor she bought outside.

00:11:47.915 --> 00:11:50.209
Mia? Mia?

00:11:50.292 --> 00:11:52.628
Mia was with you and Patrick?

00:11:52.711 --> 00:11:53.963
Yes.

00:11:54.046 --> 00:11:56.674
And she was supportive of Bella and me.

00:11:56.757 --> 00:11:59.677
She didn't mind me
and Bella sharing a room,

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:01.762
her and Patrick shared one too.

00:12:01.846 --> 00:12:05.766
Then she gave us money
before we left in the morning.

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:09.103
And you know like
when they're here at the hospital,

00:12:09.186 --> 00:12:10.521
they don't seem like a good fit?

00:12:10.604 --> 00:12:12.773
- Oh?
- But out there,

00:12:12.857 --> 00:12:15.776
Mister Tommy, they had a spark!

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:19.572
- A spark?
- Really?

00:12:19.655 --> 00:12:22.658
You should've seen them!

00:12:25.619 --> 00:12:28.706
I'm telling everyone! They have a spark?

00:12:28.789 --> 00:12:30.040
"HAVE YOU HEARD? SOMEONE HAS A SPARK!"

00:12:38.132 --> 00:12:39.133
Matmat?

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:47.725
Have you been here long, Patpat?

00:12:47.808 --> 00:12:50.394
I just got here, Matmat.

00:12:51.437 --> 00:12:53.147
Hmm…

00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:56.775
Why didn't you tell me
you were home already?

00:12:56.859 --> 00:13:01.155
Why didn't you call? Matmat called you…

00:13:03.199 --> 00:13:05.075
…27 times.

00:13:10.122 --> 00:13:12.583
Sorry, Matmat, my phone's got no charge.

00:13:12.666 --> 00:13:13.792
Hmm?

00:13:13.876 --> 00:13:17.254
Didn't… Didn't
you get to charge your phone?

00:13:17.796 --> 00:13:19.256
Where you were?

00:13:20.883 --> 00:13:22.259
I forgot to.

00:13:23.844 --> 00:13:25.221
Nobody,

00:13:25.304 --> 00:13:27.973
Nobody reminded you to charge your phone?

00:13:31.018 --> 00:13:32.895
Go home now.

00:13:32.978 --> 00:13:35.481
You're suspended,
so you shouldn't be here.

00:13:35.564 --> 00:13:37.983
Matmat's here because he has work.

00:13:38.067 --> 00:13:39.026
I'll help you.

00:13:39.109 --> 00:13:41.278
Matmat can do this, it's his work.

00:13:41.362 --> 00:13:42.905
Matmat doesn't need your help.

00:14:22.611 --> 00:14:23.904
Nurse Patty!

00:14:24.738 --> 00:14:26.949
- What?
- I have something to tell you.

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:29.535
Pogi.

00:14:29.618 --> 00:14:32.997
- Don't bother if it isn't about work--
- Just hear me out. This one's juicy.

00:14:33.706 --> 00:14:35.499
It's about Patrick and Miss Mia.

00:14:36.292 --> 00:14:39.169
Really? What is it? Come on, spill.

00:14:39.253 --> 00:14:42.256
- I overheard Kai…
- They stayed overnight there, too?

00:14:42.339 --> 00:14:44.425
They were so sweet
with each other, Mister Tommy.

00:14:44.508 --> 00:14:49.763
Miss Mia and
Patrick shared a room together?

00:14:49.847 --> 00:14:53.559
Sounds like a married couple.
Maybe they were honeymooning, too.

00:14:53.642 --> 00:14:56.770
I wouldn't be surprised
if they were to get married soon.

00:14:57.605 --> 00:14:59.815
Patrick and Miss Mia are a couple?

00:15:01.567 --> 00:15:03.360
Miss Mia's his girlfriend!

00:15:03.444 --> 00:15:04.612
Miss Mia!

00:15:04.695 --> 00:15:06.488
He's dating Mia?

00:15:07.281 --> 00:15:09.742
I'm not sure about that.
But according to Kai,

00:15:09.825 --> 00:15:12.494
Patrick and Mia stayed overnight, too,

00:15:12.578 --> 00:15:14.371
in the same place he and Bella stayed.

00:15:14.455 --> 00:15:16.415
They stayed together in one room.

00:15:16.874 --> 00:15:17.958
Really?

00:15:18.375 --> 00:15:20.377
Maybe Kai just assumed.

00:15:20.461 --> 00:15:22.171
Doc, just think about it.

00:15:22.254 --> 00:15:25.174
Would you share a room
with a girl who's not your girlfriend?

00:15:25.883 --> 00:15:27.092
So…

00:15:27.176 --> 00:15:30.763
Patrick was with Mia in Montanesa
when Kai and Bella were there?

00:15:31.221 --> 00:15:32.348
Exactly.

00:16:25.401 --> 00:16:26.318
Doc!

00:16:26.402 --> 00:16:28.946
Why didn't you tell me Matmat's here?

00:16:29.029 --> 00:16:31.949
How would I know!
You're the one itching to spill.

00:16:32.032 --> 00:16:33.951
You didn't even check
if anyone else was around.

00:16:39.123 --> 00:16:41.750
Does it really take this
long just to check on Matmat?

00:17:04.148 --> 00:17:05.816
Is that you and Matmat in the drawing?

00:17:10.404 --> 00:17:11.530
Mm, no.

00:17:12.531 --> 00:17:14.908
We never been in a camping van.

00:17:17.077 --> 00:17:18.996
Maybe it's his dream,

00:17:19.538 --> 00:17:20.956
to travel with you.

00:17:23.625 --> 00:17:25.586
Or maybe that's Mia.

00:17:28.047 --> 00:17:29.131
Oh, no.

00:17:30.966 --> 00:17:34.762
Well, your overnight stay with Mia
doesn't really count as travel--

00:17:34.845 --> 00:17:36.430
Mia and I weren't together.

00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:38.223
Liar.

00:17:44.313 --> 00:17:46.440
You're lying again.

00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:50.652
Matmat said, that it's bad to lie.

00:17:50.736 --> 00:17:51.737
Matmat.

00:17:52.196 --> 00:17:54.323
You were with Mia.

00:17:54.406 --> 00:17:55.824
But you said…

00:17:56.742 --> 00:17:59.995
You said you were going to a patient but

00:18:00.079 --> 00:18:01.997
you were really with Mia.

00:18:13.967 --> 00:18:15.427
It's true, Matmat.

00:18:16.386 --> 00:18:18.013
You're a liar!

00:18:19.807 --> 00:18:22.184
Why do always you lie?

00:18:22.267 --> 00:18:25.771
When Mia came to the apartment,

00:18:25.854 --> 00:18:28.107
you lied about that too!

00:18:28.732 --> 00:18:31.985
You were together last night,
but you didn't tell me!

00:18:33.737 --> 00:18:35.489
I don't mean to lie, Matmat.

00:18:36.323 --> 00:18:37.407
I'm sorry.

00:18:37.491 --> 00:18:38.617
Sorry.

00:18:41.912 --> 00:18:44.039
You're lying because…

00:18:45.749 --> 00:18:47.876
you don't want to be around Matmat!

00:18:50.462 --> 00:18:52.089
That's not true.

00:18:53.465 --> 00:18:55.592
You want to be with Miss Mia.

00:18:59.012 --> 00:19:01.014
Miss Mia or Matmat?

00:19:08.355 --> 00:19:10.107
Of course, I choose you.

00:19:10.649 --> 00:19:13.360
Liar! Liar!

00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:17.281
Liar! Liar!

00:19:18.157 --> 00:19:21.243
You told Mama you wanted me gone!

00:19:21.994 --> 00:19:24.329
"I hope my brother dies!"

00:19:25.372 --> 00:19:29.585
You told Mama you wanted me dead!

00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:32.504
You want me dead!

00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:49.062
"I hope my brother dies!"

00:19:49.146 --> 00:19:52.399
I hope my brother dies!

00:19:52.482 --> 00:19:54.860
I hope my brother dies!

00:19:54.943 --> 00:19:57.529
"I hope my brother dies!"

00:19:58.405 --> 00:20:00.616
I'm not his nanny!

00:20:00.699 --> 00:20:02.326
He doesn't own me!

00:20:02.409 --> 00:20:04.536
This is my life! This is my life!

00:20:05.162 --> 00:20:06.246
What did you just say?

00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:08.498
This
is my life! This is my life!

00:20:08.582 --> 00:20:10.709
Patpat said, "This is my life!"

00:20:10.792 --> 00:20:12.544
This is my life. This is my life.

00:20:15.047 --> 00:20:17.799
I hope he dies!

00:20:20.636 --> 00:20:22.930
I hope my brother dies!

00:20:24.598 --> 00:20:25.933
Patpat!

00:20:26.016 --> 00:20:27.142
Patpat!

00:20:27.976 --> 00:20:29.561
Patpat!

00:20:30.938 --> 00:20:31.980
Patpat--

00:20:35.234 --> 00:20:36.235
Patpat!

00:20:38.153 --> 00:20:39.363
Patpat!

00:20:41.073 --> 00:20:42.574
Pat…

00:20:43.659 --> 00:20:45.035
Patpat!

00:20:52.417 --> 00:20:54.920
I hope Matmat dies!

00:21:02.678 --> 00:21:10.102
"I hope my brother dies!"

00:21:21.154 --> 00:21:22.322
Matmat, no.

00:21:22.406 --> 00:21:24.116
- I saved you, remember?
- I hate you!

00:21:24.199 --> 00:21:25.492
I hate you!

00:21:25.575 --> 00:21:29.413
- You wanted me to die.
- I saved you that day.

00:21:29.496 --> 00:21:31.957
You want Matmat dead!

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:34.668
I hate you! I hate you!

00:21:34.751 --> 00:21:36.003
I hate you!

00:21:37.004 --> 00:21:38.547
I hate you!

00:21:55.939 --> 00:21:57.774
Patrick. Patrick…

00:22:57.834 --> 00:22:58.960
I'm sorry.

00:23:02.172 --> 00:23:03.799
Sorry, Matmat.

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:24.653
Sorry.

00:23:24.736 --> 00:23:26.196
Sorry, sorry.

00:23:30.325 --> 00:23:31.701
I'm sorry…

00:23:59.604 --> 00:24:01.731
People like him shut
themselves off from the world

00:24:01.815 --> 00:24:03.859
when they feel
emotions they can't explain.

00:24:05.527 --> 00:24:08.613
Talk to your brothers
so they can make up.

00:24:08.697 --> 00:24:11.158
He first needs to forgive himself.

00:24:11.241 --> 00:24:13.368
I'll wait for Matmat. He needs space.

00:24:13.451 --> 00:24:14.786
I didn't expect we'd end up like this.

00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:16.413
You didn't expect
your brother would be angry?

00:24:16.496 --> 00:24:18.957
It's just your usual
fight between siblings.

00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:21.710
Don't belittle misunderstandings.

00:24:21.793 --> 00:24:24.713
It could cost a life.
