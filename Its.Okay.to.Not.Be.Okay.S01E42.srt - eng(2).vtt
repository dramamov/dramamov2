00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:06.339
"The little brother
killed his big brother."

00:00:06.756 --> 00:00:09.467
That was just a dream.
Our swim, the overnight stay,

00:00:09.551 --> 00:00:11.928
everything we shared that morning,
all of that was just a dream!

00:00:12.011 --> 00:00:13.638
We were really together in Montanesa.

00:00:13.722 --> 00:00:14.723
That's all it'll ever be.

00:00:14.806 --> 00:00:16.558
Are you cutting me out of your life

00:00:16.641 --> 00:00:18.935
just to try to make up for
your past with your brother?

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:20.645
It's wrong that I
keep forgetting Matmat.

00:00:20.729 --> 00:00:22.939
It was a mistake that I
ever entertained having you in my life.

00:00:23.022 --> 00:00:25.692
Stop playing hostage
and victim to your family.

00:00:25.775 --> 00:00:26.860
I know that.

00:00:26.943 --> 00:00:28.987
But that doesn't
mean my conscience is clear.

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.280
Mia, let's stop this.

00:00:30.363 --> 00:00:31.698
This is where it ends for us.

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.258
Miss Mia!

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.471
What's really my purpose in life?

00:01:37.555 --> 00:01:40.183
I'm giving security guard vibes here.

00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:41.684
{\an8}- Madeth, you need to do this.

00:01:41.768 --> 00:01:44.020
{\an8}We still haven't spoken to Mia!

00:01:44.103 --> 00:01:45.396
{\an8}But boss,

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.525
{\an8}could she at least let me in the house?

00:01:49.692 --> 00:01:52.654
{\an8}Just keep knocking,
she can't not open the door.

00:01:52.737 --> 00:01:56.574
{\an8}-

00:01:56.658 --> 00:01:57.575
{\an8}

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.411
{\an8}- Miss Mia!
You can't leave her.

00:02:00.495 --> 00:02:02.038
{\an8}Because it's her birthday tomorrow.

00:02:02.997 --> 00:02:03.915
{\an8}Huh?

00:02:03.998 --> 00:02:06.584
{\an8}Then why am I the one here?

00:02:06.668 --> 00:02:09.587
{\an8}I should be the one fixing the surprises.

00:02:09.671 --> 00:02:12.423
{\an8}The confetti, cake,

00:02:12.507 --> 00:02:14.467
{\an8}spring rolls!

00:02:14.551 --> 00:02:16.886
{\an8}Madeth, you don't understand.

00:02:17.637 --> 00:02:20.181
{\an8}Mia can't be alone because…

00:02:20.265 --> 00:02:23.768
{\an8}when it's your birthday,
you remember being born, right?

00:02:23.852 --> 00:02:26.020
{\an8}Of course, it's my birthday.

00:02:27.105 --> 00:02:28.523
{\an8}I'm not finished yet!

00:02:29.023 --> 00:02:31.526
{\an8}So you remember, your birth,

00:02:32.235 --> 00:02:35.280
{\an8}- you remember, your mother.

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:39.409
Ahh.

00:02:40.326 --> 00:02:43.788
And Miss Mia
shouldn't remember her mom?

00:02:44.497 --> 00:02:45.915
Oh, thank you!

00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:49.586
She'll have a hard time,
so make sure she's okay.

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:51.462
And your planned surprises?

00:02:51.796 --> 00:02:52.964
Just do them there.

00:02:54.048 --> 00:02:55.174
Huh?

00:02:55.258 --> 00:02:56.718
How?

00:02:56.801 --> 00:02:57.844
Boss…

00:02:58.428 --> 00:02:59.262
how?

00:02:59.345 --> 00:03:03.433
Why do I have to do it all?
What are you going to do?

00:03:03.516 --> 00:03:06.394
Of course, I'll do something.
I won't just do nothing!

00:03:07.145 --> 00:03:08.646
You sure, boss?

00:03:09.272 --> 00:03:11.649
I might end up working harder than you.

00:03:14.444 --> 00:03:18.239
Madeth, you know I always
give Mia my best effort, right?

00:03:18.323 --> 00:03:20.617
So go ahead,
I still have things to do here.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:21.743
Boss!

00:03:26.831 --> 00:03:28.291
Miss Mia!

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:30.919
{\an8}Miss Mia?

00:03:32.003 --> 00:03:33.796
{\an8}Ma, let's go!

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.882
{\an8}Wait, wait a second!

00:03:35.965 --> 00:03:38.468
{\an8}I'm still stretching out my knees.

00:03:39.344 --> 00:03:41.846
{\an8}Ma, are you sure
you can still go to work?

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.891
{\an8}Yes, but you go
to your Aunt Sugar instead.

00:03:44.974 --> 00:03:47.393
{\an8}Pick up the mangoes I ordered, okay?

00:03:47.477 --> 00:03:49.229
{\an8}- Okay?
Okay, I'll get them.

00:03:50.063 --> 00:03:53.107
{\an8}Uh, do you need company?
Do you need help?

00:03:53.191 --> 00:03:55.860
{\an8}- No, I can manage.
Yes, she does.

00:03:55.944 --> 00:03:58.738
Ma, how many kilos of
mangoes did you order?

00:03:58.821 --> 00:04:00.073
Two kilos.

00:04:00.156 --> 00:04:02.033
Oh, help her carry those, okay?

00:04:02.116 --> 00:04:04.410
Since he's been working out.

00:04:04.494 --> 00:04:07.330
Ma, I'm sure I can
carry two kilos of mangoes.

00:04:07.413 --> 00:04:10.333
No, make it ten kilos.
I'll sell some at the hospital.

00:04:10.416 --> 00:04:11.834
Her mangoes are sweet.

00:04:12.418 --> 00:04:14.170
Oh, my knees. And also,

00:04:14.254 --> 00:04:16.047
you drive, okay?

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.174
- Alright, Ma.
- Dear, you'll get tired.

00:04:18.258 --> 00:04:20.301
Let him drive.

00:04:20.385 --> 00:04:22.345
{\an8}Ma, it looks like your knees are fine--

00:04:22.428 --> 00:04:23.930
{\an8}No, they still hurt!

00:04:24.013 --> 00:04:26.266
{\an8}- Look, they still hurt.
You were just pushing me…

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:28.768
{\an8}Okay, Ma, we'll go ahead.
Take care of your knees.

00:04:28.851 --> 00:04:30.478
Yes, Vincent, take care of her, okay?

00:04:30.561 --> 00:04:32.522
- Got it!
- Okay!

00:04:33.982 --> 00:04:35.566
Ouch…

00:04:43.116 --> 00:04:44.284
{\an8}Olivia?

00:04:45.076 --> 00:04:46.411
What's that for?

00:04:46.494 --> 00:04:47.996
For Matmat.

00:04:48.079 --> 00:04:50.081
I heard he's into dinosaurs.

00:04:50.164 --> 00:04:51.916
I'll take it to him, it might help.

00:04:53.418 --> 00:04:56.754
You even meddle with non-patients?

00:04:57.338 --> 00:04:59.048
Come on Eden,

00:04:59.132 --> 00:05:02.010
you turn every act of
kindness into a problem.

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:04.971
Are you really
that pessimistic about life?

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:07.807
Excuse me, Miss Olivia.

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:09.642
I need help with a patient.

00:05:29.454 --> 00:05:31.748
M-mama…

00:05:32.373 --> 00:05:36.044
M-mama dinosaur!

00:05:36.127 --> 00:05:38.254
Hello, Matmat!

00:05:38.337 --> 00:05:40.882
May I come in?

00:05:40.965 --> 00:05:44.343
M-mama dinosaur!

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.901
M-mama

00:05:59.984 --> 00:06:01.819
dinosaur!

00:06:01.903 --> 00:06:03.571
M-mama…

00:06:07.617 --> 00:06:10.328
Did you see that, Nurse Eden?

00:06:10.953 --> 00:06:13.414
She's Mama Dinosaur.

00:06:14.332 --> 00:06:15.666
But,

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:19.378
did you know there are other dinosaurs?

00:06:19.754 --> 00:06:23.674
Tyrannosaurus rex, Spinosaurus,

00:06:23.758 --> 00:06:26.469
Giganotosaurus.

00:06:26.552 --> 00:06:28.179
It all depends on,

00:06:28.971 --> 00:06:30.598
when they were born.

00:06:32.725 --> 00:06:36.229
Is there a dinosaur that can fly?

00:06:37.522 --> 00:06:39.774
Pterodactyl.

00:06:39.857 --> 00:06:44.612
Looks like a dinosaur, but it's not.

00:06:44.695 --> 00:06:47.657
That's what the book says.

00:06:49.158 --> 00:06:51.536
Oh, why aren't they dinosaurs?

00:06:53.204 --> 00:06:56.749
T-They're related to dinosaurs.

00:06:57.834 --> 00:06:59.877
Like cousins.

00:07:00.503 --> 00:07:03.798
Their bodies are just different.

00:07:04.382 --> 00:07:06.300
Hmm. I see.

00:07:06.384 --> 00:07:11.681
So, animals have families too, right?

00:07:11.764 --> 00:07:14.767
Like you and Patpat, you're family.

00:07:17.895 --> 00:07:21.315
You're so nice, M-Mama Dinosaur.

00:07:21.399 --> 00:07:23.484
Is Mama Dinosaur nice?

00:07:23.568 --> 00:07:24.861
Yes, she's nice.

00:07:28.156 --> 00:07:30.074
Like your mama?

00:07:37.957 --> 00:07:39.750
My mama is nice.

00:07:43.921 --> 00:07:46.132
But she's not always to my little brother.

00:07:49.385 --> 00:07:53.181
She's always nice to Matmat but,

00:07:53.264 --> 00:07:58.519
s-sometimes not to Patpat.

00:08:08.237 --> 00:08:10.072
Drink some soup.

00:08:10.156 --> 00:08:11.908
There's ginger.

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:14.994
It's good for your immune system.

00:08:15.703 --> 00:08:19.332
This caldereta's just the right spice,

00:08:19.415 --> 00:08:21.000
to wake up your appetite.

00:08:21.083 --> 00:08:24.003
Don't like malunggay?
You've got bitter ground.

00:08:24.545 --> 00:08:26.214
You need vegetables.

00:08:26.631 --> 00:08:28.925
If you don't want meat,
there's fish here.

00:08:31.594 --> 00:08:33.095
I'm sorry for troubling you.

00:08:34.931 --> 00:08:36.432
You don't need to worry about me too.

00:08:37.475 --> 00:08:39.435
Honestly, I'm thinking…

00:08:41.354 --> 00:08:44.482
maybe I should've just thrown you out.

00:08:46.192 --> 00:08:47.193
What?

00:08:49.612 --> 00:08:52.865
My daughter hasn't admitted her feelings,
and you already rejected her.

00:08:53.241 --> 00:08:54.825
If I were some other mother,

00:08:54.909 --> 00:08:57.578
you'd probably be getting
yelled at and cursed right now.

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:00.331
I'm sorry.

00:09:02.291 --> 00:09:04.377
But I'm not that kind of mother.

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:08.214
My conscience wouldn't let me do that.

00:09:08.297 --> 00:09:12.385
And I can't stand seeing
people around me go hungry.

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:17.974
Thank you.

00:09:18.057 --> 00:09:19.475
And again, I'm really sorry.

00:09:19.559 --> 00:09:21.644
I'll accept your apology

00:09:21.727 --> 00:09:24.063
once you eat and regain your strength.

00:09:24.814 --> 00:09:28.442
If it's okay with you,
I'll take Matmat home

00:09:28.526 --> 00:09:30.903
so you can focus on yourself.

00:09:30.987 --> 00:09:35.116
Then when you're
feeling okay, you two can talk.

00:09:38.536 --> 00:09:40.329
Why are you being so kind to us?

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.502
Whatever you went through before,

00:09:47.128 --> 00:09:49.547
is just part of who you are now.

00:09:51.549 --> 00:09:53.593
And from what I see,

00:09:53.676 --> 00:09:55.845
you're such a good kid, Patrick.

00:09:57.597 --> 00:09:59.223
Because of that kindness,

00:09:59.307 --> 00:10:03.060
I'd be glad to have
you as a son in my next life.

00:10:05.855 --> 00:10:06.856
Eat up.

00:10:17.116 --> 00:10:18.576
I don't want a next life.

00:10:40.389 --> 00:10:42.933
Don't you have to work?
You'll just get dirty here.

00:10:43.017 --> 00:10:43.976
No worries!

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:46.228
I just have client calls today.

00:10:46.312 --> 00:10:48.230
Oh, so you're just sitting around all day.

00:10:48.314 --> 00:10:49.315
Yes!

00:10:49.398 --> 00:10:52.193
But those calls were important, okay?

00:10:52.276 --> 00:10:55.738
Plus, I am guiding my publishing staff.

00:10:55.821 --> 00:10:58.574
And we're also
preparing for her birthday.

00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:01.243
Her birthday?

00:11:01.327 --> 00:11:03.079
Yes, tomorrow.

00:11:03.162 --> 00:11:06.499
I need it to be special,
for my favorite writer in the world.

00:11:08.417 --> 00:11:11.420
Is Mia the only writer in your company?

00:11:11.962 --> 00:11:13.631
No, we've got plenty.

00:11:13.714 --> 00:11:14.840
Why'd you ask?

00:11:14.924 --> 00:11:16.008
Nothing.

00:11:16.509 --> 00:11:17.635
Gemma!

00:11:18.302 --> 00:11:19.845
Auntie!

00:11:20.304 --> 00:11:23.474
Good morning!
I'm here pick up Mama's order.

00:11:23.557 --> 00:11:25.893
Oh, right! I forgot!

00:11:25.976 --> 00:11:27.728
Can you wait?

00:11:27.812 --> 00:11:31.315
I had so many customers,
so I haven't packed it yet.

00:11:31.982 --> 00:11:34.151
Maybe your friend
can help out while I sort it?

00:11:34.568 --> 00:11:37.863
Sure, auntie! I mean, mom. Wait, no!

00:11:37.947 --> 00:11:39.532
But sure, whatever you need!

00:11:39.615 --> 00:11:41.575
Apples for you and for you!

00:11:41.659 --> 00:11:44.537
This apple will change your lives.

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:46.539
How many kilos?

00:11:46.622 --> 00:11:48.165
- Just one.
- Okay, sure.

00:11:48.249 --> 00:11:50.626
Auntie, I'll take the mangoes.

00:11:50.709 --> 00:11:52.795
Actually,
I already prepared them earlier.

00:11:52.878 --> 00:11:56.257
Your mother just said
you'd be bringing a young man!

00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:58.175
Auntie, don't be too loud.

00:11:58.259 --> 00:12:02.012
I'll report back to her
that this one's approved.

00:12:03.722 --> 00:12:06.559
Ma'am, here's a thousand. Change please!

00:12:06.642 --> 00:12:09.603
Come on! Just call me auntie.

00:12:09.687 --> 00:12:11.313
Sure, auntie!

00:12:13.482 --> 00:12:15.568
- Auntie, I'll get going.
- Alright, sure.

00:12:15.651 --> 00:12:17.403
Vincent, I'm going.

00:12:17.486 --> 00:12:19.405
Oh, wait!

00:12:19.488 --> 00:12:22.867
Take these. You can
snack on them later at the hospital.

00:12:25.453 --> 00:12:26.745
Gemma,

00:12:26.829 --> 00:12:29.707
I'd say you're already
sweeter than that orange.

00:12:32.501 --> 00:12:34.378
Auntie, I'll walk Gemma over to her car.

00:12:34.462 --> 00:12:36.380
- Go on.
- I'll be back right away.

00:12:36.464 --> 00:12:37.631
Thank you, auntie.

00:12:37.715 --> 00:12:40.759
Hey, don't just
touch the fruits! Buy them!

00:12:43.345 --> 00:12:46.765
Matmat, does
your new friend have a name yet?

00:12:47.266 --> 00:12:50.019
Why not call her "Mama Joy"?

00:12:50.102 --> 00:12:52.271
"Mama Joy"?

00:12:53.022 --> 00:12:54.482
Why "Mama Joy"?

00:12:54.565 --> 00:12:56.108
No reason. I just thought of it.

00:12:56.192 --> 00:12:59.320
You said she was
like your dinosaur's mama.

00:13:00.321 --> 00:13:02.281
Is "Mama Joy" a nice name?

00:13:02.364 --> 00:13:05.075
Sounds like an old lady's name, Miss Li.

00:13:07.244 --> 00:13:09.788
Look, Matmat's smiling now.

00:13:10.915 --> 00:13:13.292
He even chatted with Nurse Eden.

00:13:14.877 --> 00:13:16.295
Seems like he's okay.

00:13:20.674 --> 00:13:23.969
Does that mean
you're ready to go home too?

00:13:29.683 --> 00:13:34.063
Remember what we tell our patients?

00:13:35.231 --> 00:13:38.234
If we want a happy environment,

00:13:39.318 --> 00:13:41.070
we need to start with ourselves.

00:13:43.906 --> 00:13:47.535
Happiness begins with you.

00:13:58.420 --> 00:13:59.421
Patrick…

00:14:02.174 --> 00:14:04.677
Think about your own happiness too.

00:14:06.845 --> 00:14:09.098
So you can share it with Matmat.

00:14:10.391 --> 00:14:13.018
It's okay to put
yourself first some times.

00:14:13.102 --> 00:14:15.354
That's not being selfish.

00:14:21.068 --> 00:14:22.945
Can I ask you a favor?

00:14:28.284 --> 00:14:31.120
Wow, boss. You seem so exhausted.

00:14:31.203 --> 00:14:35.416
I didn't just man the store,
I carried fruit boxes too.

00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:37.751
It's your own fault, Boss V.

00:14:37.835 --> 00:14:40.004
You're always trying to show off.

00:14:43.632 --> 00:14:44.758
By the way, Boss V.,

00:14:44.842 --> 00:14:46.510
- Gemma texted.
- Hmm?

00:14:48.095 --> 00:14:50.180
- And?
- She's asking how you're doing.

00:14:50.264 --> 00:14:55.394
She asked if you
were late to your client calls.

00:14:57.271 --> 00:14:58.689
So she's concerned?

00:14:58.772 --> 00:15:01.525
She didn't put a smiley or heart emoji.

00:15:01.609 --> 00:15:04.194
The message
seemed neutral, so I'm not sure.

00:15:05.195 --> 00:15:07.072
She's definitely concerned!

00:15:07.156 --> 00:15:09.825
You wouldn't ask if
you don't care, right?

00:15:09.909 --> 00:15:12.828
Success!

00:15:12.912 --> 00:15:16.665
Success? You call that a success?
That's all you achieved today!

00:15:17.124 --> 00:15:19.543
I accomplished more things than you today!

00:15:19.627 --> 00:15:21.295
I reserved a restaurant.

00:15:21.378 --> 00:15:25.257
I ordered a cake as
black as Miss Mia's soul.

00:15:26.342 --> 00:15:28.010
And Mia? Where's Mia?

00:15:31.305 --> 00:15:32.848
Dude, she's at home.

00:15:33.557 --> 00:15:36.852
I told you not to leave Mia alone.

00:15:37.811 --> 00:15:40.356
Why are you here eating those fruits!

00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:44.234
- Miss Mia! Miss Mia, please!

00:15:44.318 --> 00:15:47.529
Please wake up! Get up!

00:15:47.613 --> 00:15:50.491
Miss Mia, it's already noon!

00:15:50.574 --> 00:15:52.576
- Miss Mia!

00:15:54.411 --> 00:15:55.913
Happy now?

00:15:57.623 --> 00:15:59.375
Miss Mia!

00:15:59.458 --> 00:16:01.710
Miss Mia, can we take a selfie?

00:16:01.794 --> 00:16:03.504
I need pics or it didn't happen.

00:16:03.587 --> 00:16:05.673
Just to prove that you're okay.

00:16:06.799 --> 00:16:09.134
- Thank you, Miss Mia!

00:16:09.218 --> 00:16:10.886
Leave me alone.

00:16:15.641 --> 00:16:17.059
Okay!

00:16:17.142 --> 00:16:19.228
You really left Mia alone?

00:16:20.062 --> 00:16:21.563
"Leave me alone."

00:16:21.647 --> 00:16:23.190
Of course, I listened.

00:16:23.273 --> 00:16:24.775
I'm very obedient

00:16:24.858 --> 00:16:28.737
I followed your orders, I followed hers.
I listen to both of you. Now I'm here.

00:16:28.821 --> 00:16:30.739
- Right? Hey!
- Argh!

00:16:30.823 --> 00:16:32.866
Hey, Boss V, please!

00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:35.035
You know what Miss Mia's like.

00:16:35.119 --> 00:16:39.957
I can stay outside
her house and wait there forever.

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:42.334
If she doesn't want to go out, she won't.

00:16:42.418 --> 00:16:44.378
We can't do anything about that.

00:16:44.461 --> 00:16:46.547
Let's try again tomorrow, Boss V.

00:16:50.467 --> 00:16:53.345
What flavor was the cake you ordered
that's as black as her soul?

00:16:55.681 --> 00:16:58.058
Dark chocolate.

00:16:58.142 --> 00:16:59.309
Nice, right?

00:16:59.393 --> 00:17:01.895
Dark and not that sweet.

00:17:04.023 --> 00:17:06.066
Dinosaur! It's a dinosaur!

00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:08.610
I'm not a dinosaur,
my name is Trexy!

00:17:08.694 --> 00:17:10.487
A talking dinosaur!

00:17:10.571 --> 00:17:12.656
Aah!

00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:14.450
I won't allow it!

00:17:26.587 --> 00:17:28.922
We have to end up together.

00:17:42.102 --> 00:17:43.979
"I have Matmat's favorite.

00:17:44.063 --> 00:17:47.775
Come back here if
you don't want me to break this."

00:17:53.697 --> 00:17:56.075
Miss, can I get a serving of vegetables?

00:17:56.158 --> 00:17:58.952
I'll get this fried fish too.

00:17:59.578 --> 00:18:00.662
Thank you.

00:18:30.734 --> 00:18:37.074
"THE LITTLE BROTHER
KILLED HIS BIG BROTHER"

00:18:58.345 --> 00:18:59.680
{\an8}"It's my birthday tomorrow.

00:18:59.763 --> 00:19:03.058
{\an8}Buy me a cake? Okay, any food will do".

00:19:20.534 --> 00:19:22.286
Here you go, sir.

00:19:24.705 --> 00:19:26.165
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

00:19:48.395 --> 00:19:50.856
"Fine. Forget about the birthday.

00:19:50.939 --> 00:19:54.276
Bring me medicine and soup. I'm sick".

00:20:16.632 --> 00:20:19.801
I knew it. You can't resist me.

00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:29.603
So…

00:20:30.687 --> 00:20:31.939
What's for dinner--

00:20:40.113 --> 00:20:41.365
Aah!

00:20:42.908 --> 00:20:44.368
Why are you here?

00:20:44.451 --> 00:20:45.786
I'm sorry, ma'am.

00:20:46.495 --> 00:20:48.330
Someone's looking for you.

00:20:49.122 --> 00:20:50.332
Who?

00:20:58.298 --> 00:21:00.217
What are you doing here?

00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:03.845
Patrick asked me to get their things.

00:21:06.139 --> 00:21:07.391
So what are you?

00:21:07.891 --> 00:21:10.352
His new assistant or something?

00:21:10.435 --> 00:21:13.230
Say whatever you want.

00:21:13.313 --> 00:21:15.023
I just need to get their stuff.

00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:27.536
And you?

00:21:27.619 --> 00:21:29.162
Why are you still here?

00:21:29.746 --> 00:21:32.040
I didn't get to work this morning, ma'am.

00:21:32.124 --> 00:21:35.168
I came tonight to check on some things.

00:21:35.252 --> 00:21:36.378
Leave.

00:22:02.779 --> 00:22:04.573
Hey! Why are you in there?

00:22:04.656 --> 00:22:05.782
I'm hungry.

00:22:07.242 --> 00:22:08.785
Let's wait for her time to come.

00:22:08.869 --> 00:22:10.370
That's it?

00:22:10.454 --> 00:22:13.081
I'm sorry for what I did.
Please don't avoid me.

00:22:13.165 --> 00:22:16.752
I'm sorry for thinking
about wanting you dead.

00:22:16.835 --> 00:22:18.003
You're pissing me off.

00:22:18.086 --> 00:22:19.379
You're cute when you're mad.

00:22:19.463 --> 00:22:21.590
Why does Patrick like you?

00:22:21.673 --> 00:22:23.383
It's just us two.

00:22:23.467 --> 00:22:25.302
Patpat is mine alone.

00:22:25.385 --> 00:22:27.012
I'm all yours.
