Mr. Rain and Ms. Mink

00:00:21.245 --> 00:00:23.799
want to renovate their vacation home.

00:00:23.824 --> 00:00:25.209
I have a close friend.

00:00:25.233 --> 00:00:26.628
She's getting famous on IG right now.

00:00:27.358 --> 00:00:28.264
Are you okay?

00:00:28.744 --> 00:00:30.065
I really liked it.

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:31.837
The way you talked about your company.

00:00:31.916 --> 00:00:33.950
But I would never work with you.

00:00:33.981 --> 00:00:36.082
Why don't you try taking her out for a nice meal?

00:00:36.107 --> 00:00:37.230
She lives for food.

00:00:38.732 --> 00:00:40.519
Finish this entire jar of plum wine.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.633
I might consider working for you.

00:00:46.198 --> 00:00:47.185
Why did you kick me?

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:48.434
Whose clothes are these?

00:00:48.459 --> 00:00:49.402
They're my clothes.

00:00:49.427 --> 00:00:50.909
Why are you wearing them?

00:00:58.144 --> 00:00:59.514
What happened?

00:01:08.567 --> 00:01:10.796
Why is the world spinning, lady?

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.437
Same thing.

00:01:12.462 --> 00:01:14.440
Lady, where are you going? Wait up.

00:01:14.754 --> 00:01:16.745
Did you call a Grab yet?

00:01:17.232 --> 00:01:18.258
Ouch.

00:01:18.283 --> 00:01:19.853
So cute.

00:01:20.501 --> 00:01:21.720
I'm not a cat.

00:01:21.813 --> 00:01:22.918
So kind.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.542
Should we talking about work?

00:01:28.561 --> 00:01:31.141
Whose shoe is this? Damn it.

00:01:34.627 --> 00:01:36.213
Oh, wait.

00:01:36.238 --> 00:01:37.420
No!

00:01:37.445 --> 00:01:38.917
Wait, wait, wait.

00:01:40.234 --> 00:01:41.854
Ow, go!

00:02:06.588 --> 00:02:08.010
You should be thanking me.

00:02:08.034 --> 00:02:10.302
Otherwise, you would've ended up sleeping on the street.

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.070
Fine, thank you.

00:02:20.893 --> 00:02:22.600
Damn it.

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.365
Can you please speed up a bit?

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:49.743
I'll give you a big tip.

00:03:50.816 --> 00:03:52.050
Thank you so much.

00:03:56.436 --> 00:03:57.445
Uh, hey you.

00:03:57.478 --> 00:03:58.499
About last night

00:03:58.584 --> 00:04:00.882
just forget about it, including the offer.

00:04:00.906 --> 00:04:02.062
Let's pretend I never said anything.

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.272
As for the clothes, just give them back to Tertis.

00:04:04.296 --> 00:04:05.315
Have you called a ride yet?

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:10.015
Lady, wait a sec.

00:04:11.383 --> 00:04:13.330
Have you ever been to Kitakyushu?

00:04:15.084 --> 00:04:16.297
Why are you asking?

00:04:16.698 --> 00:04:18.240
Just answer me. Have you been there?

00:04:20.122 --> 00:04:21.900
Yes, I have. Three years ago.

00:04:29.466 --> 00:04:31.182
Hey, hurry up and get out.

00:04:31.206 --> 00:04:32.833
Yes, I'm on my way out.

00:04:33.551 --> 00:04:34.852
When you're done, get out quickly.

00:04:34.876 --> 00:04:36.014
I'm about to lock up the house.

[JINTA Architect]

00:05:02.695 --> 00:05:05.110
I think we should go with a Muji feel.

00:05:05.136 --> 00:05:05.977
Like a wooden

00:05:06.002 --> 00:05:08.456
I think you can adjust this part more.

00:05:09.867 --> 00:05:11.566
Sorry I'm late, everyone.

00:05:11.591 --> 00:05:13.010
Hey, you're only a little late.

00:05:13.161 --> 00:05:14.248
It's no big deal.

00:05:14.628 --> 00:05:16.843
It is. You have to be punctual for work.

00:05:17.258 --> 00:05:18.224
Oh.

00:05:18.463 --> 00:05:19.286

00:05:22.085 --> 00:05:23.560
Did she agree to work with us?

00:05:34.737 --> 00:05:36.024
Did we miss?

00:05:36.213 --> 00:05:37.383
She probably didn't agree.

00:06:09.103 --> 00:06:10.710
I have an answer now.

00:06:20.256 --> 00:06:21.716
I'll work for you.

00:07:44.752 --> 00:07:46.554
Are you really going to work here?

00:07:46.828 --> 00:07:48.169
You're not messing with me again, are you?

00:07:48.929 --> 00:07:50.482
When I'm serious, you don't believe me.

00:07:51.531 --> 00:07:53.506
But you were so against it before.

00:07:53.672 --> 00:07:55.811
Why did you suddenly agree to work here?

00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:00.410
Why I'm here isn't important.

00:08:00.434 --> 00:08:01.687
What's important is

00:08:02.354 --> 00:08:04.034
you're the one who needs me, right?

00:08:05.436 --> 00:08:06.429
Well, yes.

00:08:07.606 --> 00:08:08.788
But before I agree

00:08:08.812 --> 00:08:10.501
I have three conditions.

00:08:12.029 --> 00:08:13.193
First

00:08:13.217 --> 00:08:15.797
I will not work overtime under any circumstances.

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:16.596
Second

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:17.949
I will not answer messages

00:08:17.973 --> 00:08:19.742
or phone calls after work hours.

00:08:19.766 --> 00:08:20.535
Third

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:24.088
you have to take me out for delicious food every week.

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.923
What kind of conditions are these?

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:28.156
If you don't agree

00:08:28.733 --> 00:08:29.993
I won't work here.

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:46.560
Fine.

00:08:47.133 --> 00:08:49.000
I accept your conditions.

00:08:50.162 --> 00:08:51.415
Then it's a deal.

00:08:58.397 --> 00:08:59.743

this will be your new home.

00:09:35.023 --> 00:09:36.052
Understand?

00:09:37.716 --> 00:09:38.717
I know.

00:09:38.741 --> 00:09:41.529
I know it'll be hard at first.

00:09:42.008 --> 00:09:44.487
Just take your time to adjust, okay?

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:47.573
Can you stop fussy?

00:09:51.531 --> 00:09:53.600
Tertis, what's your friend doing?

00:09:53.646 --> 00:09:54.851
She's talking to rocks.

00:09:56.010 --> 00:09:58.198
Don't even try to understand her.

00:09:58.658 --> 00:09:59.729
You won't get it.

00:09:59.754 --> 00:10:01.695
- Do you want to be in the middle?
- What's do you mean?

00:10:01.719 --> 00:10:02.707
You're being difficult again.

00:10:05.783 --> 00:10:06.667
Come.

00:10:11.026 --> 00:10:12.045
Rin.

00:10:13.074 --> 00:10:15.287
This is May from accounting.

00:10:15.462 --> 00:10:17.452
And this is Yong, an architect.

00:10:17.477 --> 00:10:19.057
If you need anything, you can ask them.

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:22.214
Welcome to JINTA Architect, Rin.

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:24.887
We're like a family here. We all help each other out.

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:27.299
That's okay. I don't want to be family.

00:10:28.418 --> 00:10:30.593
Oh, why not?

00:10:32.121 --> 00:10:33.441
I've heard that

00:10:33.466 --> 00:10:36.411
if a company says they're like a family

00:10:36.435 --> 00:10:38.888
they usually end up in disaster.

00:10:38.913 --> 00:10:42.610
So I think it's better if we just stay as regular employees.

00:10:46.975 --> 00:10:48.807
Where can I get some water?

00:10:49.294 --> 00:10:50.670
Over there.

00:10:50.695 --> 00:10:51.834
Okay.

00:10:53.262 --> 00:10:54.400
Disaster?

00:10:57.854 --> 00:10:59.451
The project I want you to work on

00:10:59.475 --> 00:11:02.177
is the renovation of Rain and Mink's vacation home.

00:11:02.964 --> 00:11:04.336
It's an old house.

00:11:04.616 --> 00:11:05.683
But it's still beautiful.

00:11:06.336 --> 00:11:07.845
Initially, they

00:11:07.991 --> 00:11:10.190
want it to be a vacation home

00:11:10.214 --> 00:11:12.625
where he and his wife can relax together.

00:11:15.504 --> 00:11:17.724
Wait, hey, don't use your shirt.

00:11:17.749 --> 00:11:19.144
There are no tissues.

00:11:19.168 --> 00:11:20.325
It's too late.

00:11:20.678 --> 00:11:22.089
It's all wet now.

00:11:24.621 --> 00:11:25.847
You're so clumsy.

00:11:26.634 --> 00:11:28.044
As for the details

00:11:28.069 --> 00:11:31.310
they'll probably call us in for a briefing soon.

00:11:31.493 --> 00:11:32.575
Anyway

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:34.960
please prepare some references and basic information.

00:11:34.984 --> 00:11:36.635
In the meantime, you can

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:38.293
help others in the company with their work.

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:39.567
Okay.

00:11:40.787 --> 00:11:41.938
I'm hungry.

00:11:42.306 --> 00:11:44.091
Lady, take me to get Japanese food.

00:11:47.043 --> 00:11:48.523
It's your first day and you're already demanding it?

00:11:48.548 --> 00:11:49.850
But you already agreed.

00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:54.094
Are you going to back out?

00:11:56.239 --> 00:11:57.192
Well

00:11:57.451 --> 00:11:59.582
I'll order a bento box from my usual place for now.

00:11:59.606 --> 00:12:00.507
Is that okay?

00:12:03.017 --> 00:12:03.741
Fine.

00:12:03.765 --> 00:12:05.265
I'll let it slide since it's a first day.

00:12:07.506 --> 00:12:08.928
Let get back to work.

00:12:09.253 --> 00:12:12.316
When it arrives, please give it to me.

00:12:12.689 --> 00:12:13.690
On my desk.

00:12:14.182 --> 00:12:15.437
Be hurry, I'm hungry.

00:12:32.438 --> 00:12:34.988
Hello, Ms. Noi. This is Tertis.

00:12:35.432 --> 00:12:36.605
What?

00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:39.078
Do we design dog houses?

00:12:39.278 --> 00:12:40.833
400 square meters!

00:12:40.857 --> 00:12:42.030
Yes, we do.

00:12:42.054 --> 00:12:43.653
Our office loves animals.

00:12:50.402 --> 00:12:51.589
Hey!

00:12:51.614 --> 00:12:53.648
Damn it.

00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:55.343
Oh.

00:13:35.883 --> 00:13:36.930
Bye.

00:13:40.737 --> 00:13:41.756

The Scenario for Ms. Fai's Garden House

00:13:43.511 --> 00:13:44.532
who made it?

00:13:44.556 --> 00:13:45.627
She wants to see it.

00:13:45.651 --> 00:13:46.983
Rin made it.

00:13:47.917 --> 00:13:49.097
But she's already gone home.

00:14:04.097 --> 00:14:05.163
Is she picking up?

00:14:06.053 --> 00:14:07.230
No.

00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:11.435
[Told you I don't talk about work after hours.]

00:14:11.459 --> 00:14:13.393
[Tell your boss that, too.]

00:14:38.816 --> 00:14:41.010
But we agreed, no overtime.

00:14:41.035 --> 00:14:43.130
No OT, no answering texts after work.

00:14:43.369 --> 00:14:45.202
I'm not asking you to work overtime.

00:14:45.226 --> 00:14:47.515
I'm asking you to answer your phone, reply to texts

00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:49.823
when people really need your help.

00:14:50.270 --> 00:14:51.770
There are eight hours in a workday.

00:14:51.795 --> 00:14:52.827
Why not ask during that time?

00:14:52.851 --> 00:14:54.948
Why do you have to ask after work? I don't get it.

00:14:54.955 --> 00:14:57.250
If it wasn't important, they wouldn't have asked you.

00:14:57.629 --> 00:14:59.676
You're still young, so you probably don't know yet.

00:14:59.688 --> 00:15:00.795
In professional life

00:15:00.819 --> 00:15:02.606
not everything can go the way you want it to.

00:15:02.631 --> 00:15:04.110
But we had an agreement.

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:07.872
I hope an adult like you wouldn't forget that.

00:15:26.436 --> 00:15:27.730
Let me ask again.

00:15:28.656 --> 00:15:30.800
Do we really need this kid named Rin?

00:15:30.999 --> 00:15:32.415
Can't we just fire her?

00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:34.063
Calm down.

00:15:34.087 --> 00:15:37.150
Kids these days are just cheeky like that.

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:38.735
In all my life

00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:41.223
I've never met a kid so disrespectful.

00:15:41.247 --> 00:15:42.394
If we were in Japan

00:15:42.419 --> 00:15:43.965
this kid wouldn't have a place to stand.

00:15:45.436 --> 00:15:47.264
We still need Rin's help, Aokbab.

00:15:47.511 --> 00:15:49.066
Try to be nice to her.

00:15:49.159 --> 00:15:51.269
You can't be harsh with kids these days.

00:15:51.293 --> 00:15:52.954
If you scold them, they won't listen.

00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:54.350
Then what should I do?

00:15:54.875 --> 00:15:56.868
You have to make them see that what they think

00:15:56.952 --> 00:15:58.626
has many different perspectives.

00:15:58.650 --> 00:16:00.733
If you're going to use young grass, you have to be patient.

00:16:00.757 --> 00:16:01.851
It takes a lot of tolerance.

00:16:01.985 --> 00:16:03.057
Don't you mean a gentle approach?

00:16:04.359 --> 00:16:05.500
You just said "young grass."

00:16:05.524 --> 00:16:06.646
I said "gentle approach."

00:16:06.671 --> 00:16:08.553
Don't argue, I heard you said "young grass."

00:16:08.577 --> 00:16:10.255
What? I said "gentle approach."

00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:12.178
You said it. Don't argue with me.

00:16:12.202 --> 00:16:13.907
I told you, I said "gentle approach."

00:16:13.932 --> 00:16:15.000
Okay, fine.

00:16:18.115 --> 00:16:20.625
I'll try the gentle approach like you said.

00:16:28.883 --> 00:16:30.608
Please complete all of these CAD drawings.

00:16:30.632 --> 00:16:31.788
I need them by today.

00:16:34.934 --> 00:16:37.354
Giving me this now? How am I supposed to finish?

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:39.455
Someone as talented as you

00:16:39.665 --> 00:16:41.133
should be able to finish it in time.

00:16:43.123 --> 00:16:45.452
But if you can't finish it, that's okay too.

00:16:45.632 --> 00:16:47.977
You can just carry it over to the next day.

00:16:48.001 --> 00:16:51.116
Let it pile up with your other tasks. I understand.

00:16:51.141 --> 00:16:53.025
Because you have to go home at 6.

00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:56.533
Yes.

00:16:58.316 --> 00:16:59.854
You can wait for the work.

00:17:00.127 --> 00:17:02.595
Because I'm going home at 6.

00:17:05.310 --> 00:17:06.857
If you can do it, then try.

00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:37.590
Now you see why our classmates called her Master Rin.

00:18:13.910 --> 00:18:15.503
The work is done, Ms. Aokbab.

00:18:20.386 --> 00:18:21.339
Oh.

00:18:22.133 --> 00:18:23.533
It's exactly 6 o'clock.

00:18:23.684 --> 00:18:26.059
Time to clock out. I have to go home.

00:18:26.942 --> 00:18:28.973
But it seems like your work

00:18:28.997 --> 00:18:30.677
still has a lot left.

00:18:32.461 --> 00:18:33.910
Well, good luck.

00:18:34.949 --> 00:18:36.802
Good bye.

00:18:51.493 --> 00:18:53.400
I'm home!

00:18:53.450 --> 00:18:54.705
Wow.

00:18:54.730 --> 00:18:56.840
Why are you so happy today? What did you do?

00:18:58.706 --> 00:19:00.246
Be careful. I'll hold it.

00:19:01.463 --> 00:19:02.237
Go ahead.

00:19:07.326 --> 00:19:10.056
Someone tried to challenge Master Rin today.

00:19:10.446 --> 00:19:12.161
So I had to show them what's up.

00:19:15.605 --> 00:19:17.187
Hey, Rin.

00:19:17.473 --> 00:19:19.268
Work

00:19:19.292 --> 00:19:21.467
isn't about one-upping each other

00:19:21.655 --> 00:19:24.303
or taking your emotions out on one another.

00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:27.840
Here.

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:33.061
You have to rely on each other to move forward.

00:19:33.266 --> 00:19:35.302
Just like how you're helping me right now.

00:19:37.073 --> 00:19:38.799
Suddenly you're a life coach.

00:19:45.111 --> 00:19:46.561
Why don't we just hire a handyman?

00:19:46.586 --> 00:19:47.155
Good point.

00:19:47.179 --> 00:19:47.855
Yeah.

00:19:49.326 --> 00:19:50.040
So?

00:19:50.065 --> 00:19:51.018
I don't know.

Yes?

00:20:01.662 --> 00:20:04.531
Please check the wooden wall here for me.

00:20:04.556 --> 00:20:05.927
Right here in this area.

00:20:05.987 --> 00:20:07.928
And then take the actual materials

00:20:07.958 --> 00:20:11.144
and compare to see if this part matches.

00:20:11.175 --> 00:20:11.920
Got it.

00:20:11.944 --> 00:20:12.653
Thanks.

00:20:12.678 --> 00:20:13.685
Sure, no problem.

Ms. Aokbab.

00:20:16.532 --> 00:20:17.802
Mr. Rain's secretary just called.

00:20:17.827 --> 00:20:19.733
He wants to schedule an urgent meeting for this evening.

00:20:20.315 --> 00:20:21.349
Today?

00:20:23.646 --> 00:20:26.124
Okay, you can go ahead and confirm.

00:20:26.362 --> 00:20:27.217
Okay.

00:20:27.242 --> 00:20:28.791
Then I'll go with you, Ms. Aokbab.

It's only 4. Are you letting me go home already?

- We haven't.

00:33:31.374 --> 00:33:32.109
Rin.

00:33:32.134 --> 00:33:33.198
Wait, wait, wait.

00:33:33.799 --> 00:33:34.725
What?

00:33:34.901 --> 00:33:35.980
It's on your back.

00:33:36.407 --> 00:33:37.400
Stay still.

00:33:46.650 --> 00:33:48.436
Ahh! Lady!

00:33:53.397 --> 00:33:54.323
Lady.

00:33:54.955 --> 00:33:56.122
Are you messing with me?

00:33:56.857 --> 00:33:57.844
Sorry.

00:34:03.485 --> 00:34:04.426
Are you okay?

00:34:04.450 --> 00:34:06.170
My shoulder is broke.

00:34:07.097 --> 00:34:08.110
You're exaggerating.

00:34:26.406 --> 00:34:27.587
Nice house.

00:34:29.755 --> 00:34:31.744
My parents designed it themselves.

00:34:32.617 --> 00:34:34.036
Your parents are architects?

00:34:34.836 --> 00:34:35.748
No.

00:34:35.967 --> 00:34:37.368
My dad was an engineer.

00:34:37.707 --> 00:34:38.701
He's up there now.

00:34:38.932 --> 00:34:41.470
And my mom loved decorating.

00:34:42.087 --> 00:34:43.384
She's an angel now.

00:34:47.605 --> 00:34:49.218
It's just me and my sister Prim.

00:34:58.576 --> 00:35:00.157
Why were you crying, lady?

00:35:03.589 --> 00:35:04.789
Were you spying on me?

00:35:06.029 --> 00:35:08.802
No, I just happened to see you.

00:35:09.791 --> 00:35:12.504
People have their sad moments, that's why they cry.

00:35:13.311 --> 00:35:16.161
You can tell me if something's wrong.

00:35:24.536 --> 00:35:25.596
Alright.

00:35:25.629 --> 00:35:28.057
If you don't want to talk, I won't ask anymore.

00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:32.198
You and that person named Mind

00:35:32.223 --> 00:35:32.952
Hey.

00:35:34.668 --> 00:35:36.150
I thought you said you weren't going to ask.

00:35:37.150 --> 00:35:38.558
That was a different question.

00:35:38.582 --> 00:35:39.609
Just let me ask.

00:35:40.489 --> 00:35:42.681
You and Mind seemed close.

00:35:43.373 --> 00:35:44.799
Have you known each other for a long time?

00:35:47.858 --> 00:35:50.215
What happened today and what you saw

00:35:50.599 --> 00:35:52.022
don't you dare tell anyone.

00:35:52.248 --> 00:35:54.689
That's an order. Understand?

00:36:02.249 --> 00:36:03.743
Don't be late tomorrow.

00:36:26.262 --> 00:36:27.362
What's up?

00:36:28.392 --> 00:36:31.534
Vee, do you remember the girl with Aokbab JINTA Architect?

00:36:33.335 --> 00:36:34.475
The one named Rin.

00:36:34.795 --> 00:36:37.504
Can you find some more information about her for me?

00:36:38.205 --> 00:36:39.134
I can do that.

00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:41.510
And what's the status of the site visit to Rain's house?

00:36:42.154 --> 00:36:43.590
We have a date set now.

00:36:43.732 --> 00:36:45.363
I've already informed the team to prepare for the site visit.

00:36:46.574 --> 00:36:47.574
Thanks a lot, Vee.

00:36:47.599 --> 00:36:48.500
You're welcome.

00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:06.556
What's up, Pad?

00:37:07.536 --> 00:37:09.460
Hey, sorry, Aokbab.

00:37:09.484 --> 00:37:11.933
I can't go with you to the site visit tomorrow.

00:37:12.241 --> 00:37:14.483
One of the professors called in sick unexpectedly.

00:37:14.592 --> 00:37:15.945
So I have to cover for them.

00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:18.437
Okay. No problem.

00:37:18.461 --> 00:37:20.483
I'll try calling Chan.

00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:22.652
Okay, thanks. Sorry about that.

00:37:28.825 --> 00:37:30.125
What's up, little sis?

00:37:30.485 --> 00:37:31.530
Hey, Chan.

00:37:31.554 --> 00:37:33.750
Pad is busy tomorrow.

00:37:33.943 --> 00:37:36.267
Can you go to the site visit with me instead?

00:37:37.045 --> 00:37:39.015
Oh, I'm actually out camping.

00:37:39.406 --> 00:37:41.154
About 2-3 days before I'm back to the office.

00:37:42.096 --> 00:37:45.410
Hey, why didn't you tell me you were going somewhere?

00:37:45.726 --> 00:37:47.935
So I have to go to the site visit alone, is that it?

00:37:49.929 --> 00:37:51.175
Sorry, sis.

00:37:51.598 --> 00:37:52.391
Hey.

00:37:52.563 --> 00:37:53.764
Why don't you ask Master Rin to go with you?

00:37:54.352 --> 00:37:55.932
No way. She's so annoying.

00:37:56.145 --> 00:37:56.932
Hey.

00:37:56.957 --> 00:37:57.951
Your intention

00:37:57.975 --> 00:38:00.202
was to have Master Rin help with this project, wasn't it?

00:38:00.355 --> 00:38:02.455
This way, you two can get to know each other's working styles better.

00:38:02.534 --> 00:38:05.065
Yeah, okay. I'll think about it.

00:38:05.683 --> 00:38:07.613
And you, hurry back to work.

00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:09.353
Yes.

00:38:11.905 --> 00:38:12.925
Yes, Mom!

00:38:20.883 --> 00:38:22.965
Why do I have to take her out to eat like this?

00:38:22.989 --> 00:38:24.233
Such a waste of work time.

00:38:24.257 --> 00:38:25.211
I heard that.

00:38:26.237 --> 00:38:27.566
But you agreed, lady.

00:38:27.764 --> 00:38:29.106
Condition No. 3, remember?

00:38:37.377 --> 00:38:38.805
Hey, Rin.

00:38:38.830 --> 00:38:40.918
I have to go to a site visit at Rain's house tomorrow.

00:38:40.942 --> 00:38:41.900
I'm going.

00:38:42.802 --> 00:38:44.415
I haven't even finished my sentence.

00:38:44.642 --> 00:38:45.730
I can read your mind, lady.

00:38:45.754 --> 00:38:46.875
So, how many days are we staying over?

00:38:47.430 --> 00:38:48.790
It's a day trip.

00:38:51.055 --> 00:38:52.375
Why aren't we staying over?

00:38:52.650 --> 00:38:53.999
Hey, why would we stay over?

00:38:54.023 --> 00:38:55.270
No one does that.

00:38:55.405 --> 00:38:56.895
We're going to another province,

00:38:56.919 --> 00:38:58.238
we should make it worthwhile.

00:38:59.791 --> 00:39:02.014
We're going for work, not for a vacation.

00:39:02.867 --> 00:39:04.596
But tomorrow is Friday.

00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:05.887
We can do some sightseeing on weekend.

00:39:07.554 --> 00:39:08.948
If you're not going, that's fine.

00:39:08.973 --> 00:39:10.496
I can go by myself.

00:39:14.890 --> 00:39:16.323
Fine.

00:39:16.583 --> 00:39:17.730
Just one night.

00:39:19.702 --> 00:39:21.442
We'll come back in the morning, okay?

00:39:21.628 --> 00:39:23.703
Yay! You're so kind, lady.

00:39:23.727 --> 00:39:25.590
Let's get a nice hotel. A 5-star one.

00:39:25.717 --> 00:39:26.684
5-star.

00:39:31.288 --> 00:39:32.389
Lady, can I order more?

00:39:32.413 --> 00:39:33.334
I don't think this is enough.

00:39:34.971 --> 00:39:35.975
How many days?

00:39:36.233 --> 00:39:38.193
I'll be back the day after tomorrow.

00:39:39.095 --> 00:39:40.300
This is a surprise.

00:39:40.324 --> 00:39:42.273
You barely go anywhere.

00:39:42.297 --> 00:39:44.006
Especially not with people you're not close to.

00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:45.335
What made you agree to go?

00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:47.278
Ugh, I didn't want to go.

00:39:47.543 --> 00:39:49.930
But it's for work, so I have to.

00:39:50.098 --> 00:39:52.011
I'm being forced by my professional duties.

00:40:00.019 --> 00:40:01.619
I know you well.

00:40:02.139 --> 00:40:04.349
Someone like you can't be forced by anyone.

00:40:04.542 --> 00:40:05.435
Not unless you want to go yourself.

00:40:05.459 --> 00:40:06.317
Power bank!

00:40:06.647 --> 00:40:08.430
I should go get it before I forget.

00:40:09.049 --> 00:40:10.289
Power bank.

00:40:18.835 --> 00:40:20.076
I'm here.

00:40:20.450 --> 00:40:22.678
You're 5 minutes late. Be on time next time.

00:40:22.944 --> 00:40:24.684
Lady, it's just 5 minutes.

00:40:28.817 --> 00:40:30.089
Lady, give me a hand.

00:40:31.257 --> 00:40:33.284
When we get there, let's eat first.

00:40:33.308 --> 00:40:34.991
I've already searched for the best spots.

00:40:35.311 --> 00:40:37.010
Is your life all about eating?

00:40:37.366 --> 00:40:40.330
An army marches on its stomach.

00:40:41.462 --> 00:40:42.543
Let's go.

00:40:43.075 --> 00:40:46.374
Did you just trick me into carrying your bag?

00:40:46.398 --> 00:40:47.579
No.

00:41:27.982 --> 00:41:28.921
Whoa.

00:41:29.743 --> 00:41:31.503
The view is amazing, lady.

00:41:32.769 --> 00:41:34.231
The location is incredible.

00:41:36.458 --> 00:41:37.803
But a house by the sea like this

00:41:37.827 --> 00:41:39.830
has both its pros and cons.

00:41:40.270 --> 00:41:42.175
There's the sun, the wind

00:41:42.199 --> 00:41:43.574
and then there's the humidity.

00:41:44.744 --> 00:41:46.430
Hello.

00:41:47.305 --> 00:41:48.460
Hello.

00:41:49.279 --> 00:41:50.298
You must be the architects

00:41:50.322 --> 00:41:51.906
here to see Mr. Rain's house, right?

00:41:51.931 --> 00:41:52.720
Yes, we are.

00:41:52.832 --> 00:41:53.888
I'm Mun.

00:41:53.912 --> 00:41:56.020
Mr. Rain asked me to assist you.

00:41:56.240 --> 00:41:58.950
I'll give you a tour of the house.

00:41:59.269 --> 00:42:00.249
Thank you for your help.

00:42:00.274 --> 00:42:01.104
This way, please.

00:42:10.833 --> 00:42:12.088
Please, come in.

00:42:14.172 --> 00:42:15.310
This house actually

00:42:15.335 --> 00:42:17.577
belonged to Ms. Mink's late grandmother.

00:42:17.601 --> 00:42:19.090
She left it to Ms. Mink as an inheritance

00:42:19.115 --> 00:42:21.150
back when Ms. Mink was still in school.

00:42:23.007 --> 00:42:24.930
Before her grandmother passed away

00:42:25.269 --> 00:42:27.149
Ms. Mink still used to visit this house.

00:42:28.110 --> 00:42:30.867
But it's a shame no one lives here now.

00:42:34.788 --> 00:42:38.190
The house has fallen into disrepair, as you can see.

00:42:41.797 --> 00:42:42.984
Well then...

00:42:43.674 --> 00:42:45.996
I'll leave you to your work.

00:42:46.267 --> 00:42:48.491
If you need anything, just let me know.

00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:49.998
Thank you.

00:42:50.186 --> 00:42:51.298
I'll be on my way then.

00:43:02.692 --> 00:43:03.697
Shall we start?

00:43:20.802 --> 00:43:22.790
Lady, move a bit.

00:43:22.815 --> 00:43:23.550
Move what?

00:43:23.575 --> 00:43:26.010
I'm measuring. Your head is in the way.

00:43:26.761 --> 00:43:28.950
Move it. Look at the wall.

00:43:28.950 --> 00:43:30.394
I'm measuring this part.

00:43:30.494 --> 00:43:32.110
This part is more important.

00:43:37.679 --> 00:43:39.027
Whatever you say.

00:43:50.042 --> 00:43:51.102
Lady.

00:43:51.208 --> 00:43:52.155
What?

00:44:11.783 --> 00:44:14.150
I was going to say there's a water leak.

00:44:18.370 --> 00:44:20.143
Oh, over there?

00:44:21.138 --> 00:44:22.178
I'll go check.

00:44:59.342 --> 00:45:00.589
Thanks, lady.

00:45:10.919 --> 00:45:12.028
Take pictures of the surroundings

00:45:12.052 --> 00:45:13.520
and measure the interior and exterior areas.

00:45:13.545 --> 00:45:14.766
Then send it all to Vee.

00:45:17.955 --> 00:45:20.174
I told you we'd be seeing each other a lot.

00:45:23.738 --> 00:45:24.827
Have you been here long?

00:45:25.100 --> 00:45:26.153
Want to take a look inside together?

00:45:30.456 --> 00:45:32.450
I think it's better if we work separately.

00:45:35.971 --> 00:45:36.918
I just wanted to talk to you.

00:45:36.924 --> 00:45:38.345
But I don't want to talk to you, Mind.

00:45:40.106 --> 00:45:41.486
Please, feel free to look around the house.

00:45:42.088 --> 00:45:43.750
JINTA Architect is done here.

00:45:44.811 --> 00:45:46.071
Rin, let's go.

00:45:49.140 --> 00:45:51.242
It reminds me of the time we went to the beach together.

00:45:52.273 --> 00:45:53.440
Do you remember, Aokbab?

00:46:07.260 --> 00:46:08.284
Let's go get something to eat.

00:46:08.308 --> 00:46:09.029
You're hungry, right?

00:46:10.615 --> 00:46:11.674
I'm hungry?

00:46:12.161 --> 00:46:12.915
Yes.

00:46:20.949 --> 00:46:22.836
I'm always down for food. Let's go.

00:46:51.616 --> 00:46:53.713
Lady, what are you doing? You're making a mess.

00:46:54.633 --> 00:46:55.648
You don't know how to crack it?

00:46:57.758 --> 00:46:59.273
Give it here. I'll do it for you.

00:46:59.552 --> 00:47:00.727
Such a waste.

00:47:06.838 --> 00:47:09.401
How did you grow up without knowing how to do this?

00:47:09.761 --> 00:47:11.323
What do you do when you go out for seafood?

00:47:11.850 --> 00:47:13.527
I order the kind that's already shelled.

00:47:13.767 --> 00:47:15.791
And if there isn't a shelled option?

00:47:16.017 --> 00:47:17.284
I have someone else do it for me.

00:47:17.477 --> 00:47:19.612
Don't tell me that someone is Mind.

00:47:35.664 --> 00:47:37.604
Mind, you're so good at cracking crabs.

00:47:39.709 --> 00:47:41.282
Well, if I can't do it

00:47:41.433 --> 00:47:42.827
who's going to do it for you?

00:47:46.181 --> 00:47:47.114
Then...

00:47:48.309 --> 00:47:51.191
can you crack crabs for me forever?

00:49:47.050 --> 00:49:48.874
She really used to do it for you, didn't she?

00:49:53.190 --> 00:49:54.276
Don't eat it.

00:49:55.629 --> 00:49:56.784
You can't eat this shrimp either.

00:49:56.809 --> 00:49:58.451
What is wrong with you?

00:49:58.809 --> 00:50:00.132
Tell me first.

00:50:00.163 --> 00:50:02.246
What's about you and old hag from Mind Space?

00:50:02.560 --> 00:50:03.585
Watch your words.

00:50:03.724 --> 00:50:05.145
Are you defending her?

00:50:06.389 --> 00:50:07.655
Give it here. You're not eating any.

00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:10.221
Whatever is between us is my business.

00:50:11.456 --> 00:50:12.178
Give it here.

00:50:12.202 --> 00:50:12.684
Let go.

00:50:12.708 --> 00:50:13.895
Give it to me.

00:50:22.416 --> 00:50:23.736
What a waste.

00:50:24.342 --> 00:50:25.623
What are you doing?

00:50:26.005 --> 00:50:27.225
You're the one.

00:50:28.226 --> 00:50:29.626
Peel another one for me.

00:50:31.720 --> 00:50:32.676
Don't eat it.

00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:33.962
But this is my money.

00:50:33.987 --> 00:50:35.375
I'm your subordinate.

00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:37.395
I'm your boss. I'm treating you to this meal.

00:50:37.420 --> 00:50:39.041
You can't just order everyone around.

00:50:39.065 --> 00:50:40.052
This is my hand.

00:50:52.766 --> 00:50:55.339
There's no reservation name Aokbab in system.

00:50:56.036 --> 00:50:58.207
How can that be? I already made a reservation.

00:50:58.823 --> 00:51:00.649
But there's really nothing in the system.

00:51:01.021 --> 00:51:03.042
Can I see the booking confirmation, please?

00:51:04.753 --> 00:51:05.666
Here it is.

00:51:09.963 --> 00:51:12.290
[Sunday, June 29, 2025]

00:51:14.118 --> 00:51:15.764
[May]

00:51:18.430 --> 00:51:21.165
The reservation you made is for next month.

00:51:21.189 --> 00:51:22.663
Not for this month.

00:51:25.559 --> 00:51:29.678
[Sunday, June 29, 2025]

00:51:32.215 --> 00:51:33.889
[May]

00:51:34.138 --> 00:51:35.813
So Tertis booked the wrong date.

00:51:35.838 --> 00:51:37.085
What was he thinking?

00:51:38.233 --> 00:51:40.733
Do you have any available rooms for tonight?

00:51:41.246 --> 00:51:42.558
Our hotel is fully booked tonight.

00:51:42.582 --> 00:51:44.756
Every room is occupied.

00:51:45.627 --> 00:51:47.222
Are there any other hotels around

00:51:47.246 --> 00:51:48.294
here you can recommend?

00:51:48.319 --> 00:51:49.455
I'm not sure.

00:51:49.480 --> 00:51:50.929
I'm very sorry.

00:51:51.602 --> 00:51:53.451
I can share my room, if you want.

00:51:56.890 --> 00:51:58.612
I can go sleep with my team member.

00:52:01.195 --> 00:52:02.186
That's okay.

00:52:02.830 --> 00:52:04.181
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

00:52:04.206 --> 00:52:04.995
Let's go.

00:52:28.520 --> 00:52:29.973
Can you stop tapping?

00:52:41.228 --> 00:52:42.430
Lady, why did you turn it off?

00:52:42.430 --> 00:52:43.950
I don't like listening to music.

00:52:50.832 --> 00:52:53.680
So the story goes like this.

00:52:53.787 --> 00:52:56.971
My friends and I like to go to the beach.

00:52:57.384 --> 00:53:00.032
The road is quite rural.

00:53:00.646 --> 00:53:02.773
Suddenly, my car...

00:53:02.804 --> 00:53:04.631
- ran over something.
- Can you turn that off?

00:53:04.717 --> 00:53:06.370
- Lady, I'm listening.
- At the front desk

00:53:06.395 --> 00:53:08.547
there was only one room left, number 13.

00:53:08.934 --> 00:53:10.304
And when we opened it

00:53:10.462 --> 00:53:12.058
it smelled so musty.

00:53:12.082 --> 00:53:14.255
And there were sacred threads hanging everywhere.

00:53:15.248 --> 00:53:16.114
Hey.

00:53:16.323 --> 00:53:18.053
Why did you turn it off, lady?

00:53:18.307 --> 00:53:19.819
I just want to drive in silence.

00:53:27.629 --> 00:53:29.089
That's enough. Just sit quietly.

00:53:32.873 --> 00:53:33.973
Oh, lady...!

00:53:35.238 --> 00:53:37.618
Aha! you knew it.

00:53:44.676 --> 00:53:46.309
Are you sure this is the right way?

00:53:47.902 --> 00:53:50.119
This is what Google Maps said.

00:53:50.496 --> 00:53:52.231
You're scared of ghosts, aren't you?

00:53:52.573 --> 00:53:53.775
Boo!

00:53:54.072 --> 00:53:55.789
Ow, can you not do that?

00:53:55.813 --> 00:53:56.927
It's dangerous.

00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:58.344
I thought you said you weren't scared of ghosts.

00:53:59.409 --> 00:54:00.516
Busted.

00:54:01.613 --> 00:54:02.799
Just admit you're scared.

00:54:22.040 --> 00:54:24.447
Lady, what's wrong with the car?

00:54:25.133 --> 00:54:27.192
It says there's a problem with the tire.

00:54:29.034 --> 00:54:29.894
Oh.

00:54:40.831 --> 00:54:42.285
Lady, the tire's flat.

00:54:48.984 --> 00:54:51.350
Try to find the number for a garage around here.

00:54:51.375 --> 00:54:52.600
- A garage?
- Yes.

00:54:54.380 --> 00:54:55.772
I have no signal.

00:54:56.843 --> 00:54:57.704
What do we do?

00:55:00.581 --> 00:55:02.029
I don't have any either.

00:55:03.192 --> 00:55:04.402
What do we do?

00:55:05.263 --> 00:55:06.504
What do we do?

00:55:06.752 --> 00:55:09.019
I think we have to walk.

00:55:10.771 --> 00:55:12.440
Walk to the nearest hotel.

00:55:12.464 --> 00:55:14.495
I think there was one nearby on the map earlier.

00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:15.707
Right now?

00:55:15.732 --> 00:55:17.276
Do you want to sleep here instead?

00:55:17.300 --> 00:55:19.002
There's no other choice.

00:55:19.942 --> 00:55:21.087
This place is even scarier.

00:55:21.118 --> 00:55:22.750
Hurry up, lady. Stop thinking.

00:55:23.338 --> 00:55:24.333
Let's go.

00:55:24.357 --> 00:55:25.700
Open it. How to open?

00:55:53.993 --> 00:55:55.388
It's just like the haunted hotel

00:55:55.412 --> 00:55:56.435
from the show we listened to today.

00:55:57.633 --> 00:55:59.062
Why aren't you sleeping in your own room?

00:55:59.087 --> 00:56:00.697
Don't tell me you're scared of ghosts.

00:56:02.098 --> 00:56:04.888
Do you think we can beat Mind Space?

00:56:04.912 --> 00:56:06.657
Of course. We will not lose.

00:56:06.897 --> 00:56:08.190
Why can't we lose?

00:56:08.215 --> 00:56:09.609
Because the person named Mind

00:56:10.009 --> 00:56:11.642
is the person I hate the most.

00:56:11.890 --> 00:56:14.118
I helped you get away from that old hag.

00:56:14.143 --> 00:56:15.792
Aren't you going to say thank you?

00:56:16.655 --> 00:56:17.681
Rin.

00:56:18.664 --> 00:56:20.364
I'm going to erase Mind from my life.

00:56:20.846 --> 00:56:22.770
And I will take back everything that's mine.
