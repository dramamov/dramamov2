[Fated Hearts]

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:43.979
[Episode 17]

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:46.560
This is the first time

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.350
I've ever given a girl a gift.

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:50.630
You cannot refuse it.

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.240
Then I suppose I should be honored.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.950
Should I

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.880
give you a generous gift in return?

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.390
After my mother passed away,

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.520
everyone close to me,

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.400
those I trusted,

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.840
either left or betrayed me.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.400
I've long been used to

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.910
hiding how I really feel.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.000
But with you,

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.040
I don't feel the need to hide anything.

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:35.620
You know what?

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.910
You were the first person

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.730
who ever said you'd protect me.

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.390
You were also the first to tell me

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:44.680
I didn't have to

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:45.880
lick my wounds alone.

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:47.840
I'm truly happy…

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.890
to have met you in this life.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.170
What's gotten into you?

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.430
Are you feeling emotional

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.360
because of your sister's wedding?

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:18.340
Save these sweet words

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:19.120
for your own

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.680
wedding night.

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:24.150
Alright.

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:26.030

Your Highness,

it's getting late.

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:27.070
Do you plan to sit with me until dawn?

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:13.310
Princess, if you're tired,

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:14.690
you may go to bed first.

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:21.830
I know you still

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:23.230
can't let go of Fu Yixiao.

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.260
But I believe that one day,

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:27.270
I'll take her place in your heart.

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:30.430
Actually, I've prepared

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:31.510
a gift for you.

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:34.630
Tonight,

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:37.240
I'm willing to help you leave Susha.

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:47.000
What did you say?

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:51.710
No one would expect us

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:53.700
to run away on our wedding night.

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:55.270
With this,

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:56.970
our escape should go smoothly.

00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:58.590
[Su]

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:02.720
Do you know

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:04.120
what this will cost you?

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:07.480
If I don't make sacrifices,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:08.680
how can I ever

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:09.870
replace Fu Yixiao?

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:12.510
Princess Xiyang,

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:14.310
I can give you

00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:17.390
the status and honor
befitting the Princess of Zhennan.

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:18.600
But I'll never

00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:20.680
love you.

00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:25.920
You don't have to do this for me.

00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:27.680
I don't want to owe you anything.

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:29.140
You don't owe me anything.

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:31.380
I'm doing this willingly.

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:36.450
[Happiness]

00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:51.400
There are too many people here.

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:56.940
Let me take you somewhere.

00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:06.320
Enjoy.

00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:12.720
Didn't you always complain

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:13.630
that the food at my manor

00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:14.720
was too bland?

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:17.410
Today, I'll treat you to some tasty meat.

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:18.870
Is there no meat

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:20.820
at the First Prince's Residence?

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:21.840
The roasted meat at my place

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:23.100
can't compare to this.

00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:24.670
The roasted meat here

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:26.470
is the best in all of Yujing City.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.860
But you're hardly ever in Yujing.

00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:29.550
How do you know

00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:30.840
where to find good food?

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:31.750
I didn't know.

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:32.910
Yao told me.

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:37.180
You specifically asked him about it?

00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:44.510
Don't you usually

00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:45.910
prefer light food?

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:48.180
Why are you adding so many spices?

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:50.210
You like spicy food, don't you?

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:52.750
Besides spicy food,
you also enjoy drinking.

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:54.030
Aside from garlic,

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:55.530
you're not picky at all.

00:09:58.030 --> 00:09:59.290
You remember all that?

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:01.120
When did you notice?

00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:02.390
You've been at my place

00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:03.480
for a while now.

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:04.870
If I couldn't

00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:06.150
even pick up on that,

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:07.970
how could I command an army?

00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:10.800
Since you're so observant,

00:10:11.270 --> 00:10:12.550
do you also remember what Lu Ke

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:13.880
and Yun Fang like to eat?

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:14.750
They...

00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:22.570
Eat while it's hot.

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:24.900
It won't taste as good once it's cold.

00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:30.360
How is it?

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:32.960
It's really good.

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:35.320
Here.

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:44.920
You're so thoughtful.

00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:45.720
I assume you've cared for

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:47.380
plenty of other women before.

00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:49.870
Yes.

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:52.150
I've traveled far and wide

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:53.360
and met all kinds of people.

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:56.020
Naturally, I've crossed paths
with many women.

00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:57.240
Some of them

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:58.960
said they wanted to stay and serve me

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:00.750
to thank me for saving their lives.

00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:02.000
I couldn't drive them away,

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.440
so I just let them stay.

00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:06.810
They were completely obedient to me.

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:09.480
Sounds like your years on the battlefield

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:10.740
were a little too easy.

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:12.390
What do you mean?

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:14.720
I've saved quite a few people

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:16.030
on the battlefield too.

00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:16.750
Some of them were

00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:19.080
handsome, down-on-their-luck scholars.

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:20.480
Like you, I was very kind.

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:21.630
If they wanted

00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:23.790
to offer themselves
in return for my kindness,

00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:25.270
I brought them all home.

00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:26.360
They were perfect

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:26.790
for teaching

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:28.030
Fang and Shunzi.

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:29.750
It saved me a fortune on tutors.

00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:31.360
Alright, stop making things up.

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:32.630
I was joking just now.

00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:34.550
There weren't that many women

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:36.320
on the remote battlefields.

00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:37.960
But I wasn't lying.

00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:39.390
Fang told me himself—

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:41.670
I really did save

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:43.080
four or five broke scholars

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:44.140
and bring them home

00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:46.410
to tutor the kids in reading and writing.

00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:54.030
S-Seriously?

00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:56.120
I don't remember any of that.

00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:57.650
But Fang wouldn't lie to me.

00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:13.280
Stop eating.

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:14.860
I was messing with you.

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:16.660
You actually believed me?

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:22.080
I knew I shouldn't have trusted you.

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:28.650
Why are you looking at me like that?

00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:30.270
I'm just thinking about the rumors

00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:31.720
that the First Prince of Susha

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:33.510
is ruthless and bloodthirsty.

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:35.140
Looking at you now,

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:37.240
I find those rumors ridiculous.

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:38.360
Not entirely.

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:40.510
Remember I told you

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:41.510
when I was young,

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:42.970
anyone who tried to hurt me

Even back then,

00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:46.990
the palace was full of rumors

00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:48.390
that I was bloodthirsty.

00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:50.720
Later, I went to war

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:53.030
and stained my hands with even more blood.

we're the same kind of people?

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:10.680
Jinxiu's Beiyan Pass.

00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:11.440
Your Highness,

00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:13.480
but Beiyan Pass isn't
part of the southern frontier.

00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:14.380
If we go there,

00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:16.280
the border troops will only

00:24:16.350 --> 00:24:17.810
take us to Shengjing City.

00:24:18.270 --> 00:24:20.110
You left Susha without permission.

00:24:20.110 --> 00:24:21.720
That's already
disobeying the imperial edict.

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:23.550
If you're taken to Shengjing,

00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:25.160
you'll be completely defenseless

00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:26.960
with little chance of survival.

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:29.070
If I had a choice,

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:31.890
I wouldn't go to Shengjing either.

00:24:32.030 --> 00:24:33.560
But if we continue forward,

00:24:34.030 --> 00:24:35.830
Feng Suige will stop us for sure.

00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:38.610
Better to take my chances in Shengjing

00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:40.620
than be locked up in Susha.

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:42.730
Let's go.

00:24:43.270 --> 00:24:43.750
Yes.

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:45.070
This way.

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:52.640
Once we get through the gorge ahead,

00:25:52.690 --> 00:25:54.590
we'll reach Jinxiu's Beiyan Pass.

00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:56.390
Princess, you can rest easy now.

00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:18.440
Feng Suige?

00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:22.440
Wait.

00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:24.680
If Xia Jingshi suspects

00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:25.270
we're lying in wait at Qixia Valley,

00:26:25.270 --> 00:26:26.510
[Beiyan Pass]

00:26:26.510 --> 00:26:27.870
he'd rather detour

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:29.070
to Jinxiu's Beiyan Pass

00:26:29.070 --> 00:26:30.730
than risk being stopped by me.

00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:32.240
You and Yun Fang

00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:33.680
take your men and head to Qixia Valley.

00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:34.270
Gu Yu, come with me.

00:26:34.270 --> 00:26:34.680
Yes.

00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:41.240
Xia Jingshi!

00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:43.430
With me here,

00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:45.440
none of you are getting away.

00:26:57.440 --> 00:26:57.900
Attack!

00:27:55.750 --> 00:27:56.440
Brother,

00:27:57.680 --> 00:27:58.790
please let us go.

00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:03.350
I'm begging you, just let us go!

00:28:06.550 --> 00:28:07.680
Don't come any closer!

00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:09.160
Xiyang, put the knife down!

00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:09.750
Leave!

00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:11.920
Or I swear I'll die right here!

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:16.460
Don't be foolish, Xiyang.

00:28:17.070 --> 00:28:17.950
Listen to me.

00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:19.290
Put the knife down.

00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:20.250
Brother,

00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:21.310
all my life,

00:28:21.310 --> 00:28:22.770
you've always spoiled me.

00:28:23.110 --> 00:28:23.830
Why can't you

00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:24.510
let me

00:28:24.510 --> 00:28:26.350
follow my heart just this once?

00:28:26.790 --> 00:28:28.880
How could you expect me
to stand by and watch

00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:30.270
as you're trapped in an enemy country?

00:28:30.270 --> 00:28:31.800
His Highness is my husband.

00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:32.830
Going back to Jinxiu with him

00:28:32.830 --> 00:28:33.960
is only natural.

00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:35.310
He'll treat me well.

00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:37.880
Xiyang,

00:28:38.790 --> 00:28:40.940
I've never begged you for anything.

00:28:41.070 --> 00:28:42.530
Let this be the first time.

00:28:45.270 --> 00:28:46.730
Please, come home with me.

00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:49.110
No.

00:28:50.790 --> 00:28:51.720
Xia Jingshi!

00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:54.510
If you're a real man,

00:28:55.030 --> 00:28:56.240
get out here now!

00:28:58.790 --> 00:29:00.270
Stop pushing me.

00:29:00.550 --> 00:29:02.400
Do you really want me to die?

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:24.460
Xiyang!

00:29:24.750 --> 00:29:25.480
Brother!

00:29:49.790 --> 00:29:50.650
Your Highness.

00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:52.260
Your Highness.

00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:01.200
Your Highness.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.330
Don't hurt my brother!

00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:44.030
Brother!

00:30:52.030 --> 00:30:52.640
Brother!

00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:55.920
If you still see me as family,

00:30:56.550 --> 00:30:57.820
let us go.

00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:21.350
Everyone,

00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:22.480
retreat!

00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:28.020
Your Highness.

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:33.510
Stop!

00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:38.550
Let them go.

00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:05.880
Princess, you'd better think this through.

00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:07.770
There's no turning back from here.

00:32:07.770 --> 00:32:08.880
If you want to stay,

00:32:09.070 --> 00:32:10.400
get off the carriage now.

00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:12.330
There's no turning back for me now.

00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:13.920
Wherever you go,

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.200
that's where I'll be.

00:33:16.790 --> 00:33:17.640
Your hand recovery

00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:18.590
will take time.

00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:20.000
Even though you've regained

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:21.270
some strength in your left hand,

00:33:21.270 --> 00:33:23.240
you mustn't overexert it,

00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:26.050
or this hand will be permanently damaged.

00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:46.610
Your Highness,

00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:47.880
Military Advisor Xiao is injured.

00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:50.010
Shall we stop ahead to rest for a while?

00:33:53.310 --> 00:33:53.840
Alright.

00:34:15.670 --> 00:34:17.480
Greetings, Prince of Zhennan.

00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:20.260
Your Highness,

00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:21.889
these are the soldiers
stationed at Beiyan Pass.

00:34:21.889 --> 00:34:23.110
The Emperor has been informed

00:34:23.110 --> 00:34:25.030
of your unauthorized
departure from Susha.

00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:25.920
Please, Prince of Zhennan,

00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:28.580
return with us to the capital
to see His Majesty.

00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:34.150
Fine.

00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:57.800
I ordered you to guard Yujing City

00:34:57.820 --> 00:34:59.510
and watch over the royal villa.

00:34:59.510 --> 00:35:00.320
And this is how

00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:02.150
you all fulfilled your duties?

00:35:07.030 --> 00:35:08.670
How impressive.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.580
Here in Susha,

00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:13.630
the Prince of Zhennan comes

00:35:13.630 --> 00:35:14.710
and goes as he pleases.

00:35:14.710 --> 00:35:16.240
What use are any of you to me?

00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:18.130
Your Majesty, please forgive us.

00:35:18.130 --> 00:35:19.730
We deserve death for letting

00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:21.420
the Prince of Zhennan escape.

00:35:22.230 --> 00:35:22.670
But…

00:35:22.710 --> 00:35:23.480
But what?

00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:28.400
Are you trying to say
I've wrongly accused you?

00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:30.120
I wouldn't dare.

00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:31.030
It's just that

00:35:31.230 --> 00:35:33.230
the Princess had an imperial token.

00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:34.750
As a city gate official,

00:35:35.150 --> 00:35:36.280
I didn't dare defy it.

00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:37.210
What did you say?

00:35:40.190 --> 00:35:41.230
The Princess must have

00:35:41.230 --> 00:35:43.010
stolen Your Majesty's token.

00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:44.510
That's how she was able

00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:46.030
to leave Susha

00:35:46.030 --> 00:35:47.230
without resistance.

00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:50.320
The Princess is young and reckless.

00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:52.880
Please don't be angry, Your Majesty.

00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:54.770
She actually...

00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:56.680
Your Majesty!

00:36:11.230 --> 00:36:11.960
Leave!

00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:14.230
Or I swear I'll die right here!

00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:36.760
You're awake.

00:36:46.510 --> 00:36:48.240
You fell asleep here all alone.

00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:50.760
I was afraid you'd get cold,
so I made a fire.

00:36:51.630 --> 00:36:52.290
Drink this.

00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:53.360
It'll warm you up.

00:37:11.590 --> 00:37:12.070
Didn't I tell you

00:37:12.070 --> 00:37:13.330
to stay in Yujing City?

00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:14.850
Why are you here?

00:37:15.630 --> 00:37:17.440
I had nothing to do, so I came.

00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:19.150
But how did you know

00:37:19.150 --> 00:37:19.670
we were heading

00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:21.130
for Jinxiu's Beiyan Pass?

00:37:21.190 --> 00:37:22.360
After leaving Yujing,

00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:24.360
I was heading toward Pingling City,

00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:25.360
but on the way,

00:37:25.590 --> 00:37:26.030
I saw

00:37:26.030 --> 00:37:27.550
carriage tracks
leading toward Beiyan Pass.

00:37:27.550 --> 00:37:29.810
I figured it was Xia Jingshi's carriage,

00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:30.840
so I followed.

00:37:33.070 --> 00:37:34.400
Once they pass this desert,

00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:36.460
they'll reach Jinxiu's border soon.

00:37:38.190 --> 00:37:39.230
By now, Xiyang is

00:37:39.230 --> 00:37:39.800
probably already

00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:41.230
on her way to Shengjing.

00:37:43.630 --> 00:37:45.000
When our mother died,

00:37:45.710 --> 00:37:46.960
Xiyang was only four.

00:37:48.150 --> 00:37:49.350
I swore then

00:37:49.510 --> 00:37:51.280
that I'd protect her for life.

00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:53.510
But now I realize—

00:37:54.550 --> 00:37:55.880
no matter what I do,

00:37:57.510 --> 00:37:59.280
no matter how hard I try,

00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:02.450
it never seems to be enough.

00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:07.020
You didn't do anything wrong.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:09.660
You did everything you could.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.320
It was her decision.

00:38:12.550 --> 00:38:13.880
She already seemed off

00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:15.590
on her wedding day.

00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:17.400
I should've noticed then

00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:18.440
that she'd made up her mind

00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:19.900
to leave with Xia Jingshi.

00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:21.840
If I had stopped her then,

00:38:22.630 --> 00:38:23.320
she wouldn't

00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:24.650
have ended up like this.

00:38:24.710 --> 00:38:26.120
She had made up her mind.

00:38:26.510 --> 00:38:28.370
But even if you had seen it coming,

00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:30.000
what could you have changed?

00:38:34.190 --> 00:38:35.590
All I can do now

00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:37.840
is pray she'll be happy.

00:38:45.710 --> 00:38:47.170
That's wishful thinking.

00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:48.190
Someone who could've

00:38:48.190 --> 00:38:49.790
brought himself to kill you—

00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:50.480
how could he ever

00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:51.680
make my sister happy?

00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:53.110
I knew fully well

00:38:53.110 --> 00:38:54.190
that Jinxiu would be

00:38:54.190 --> 00:38:55.390
a living hell for her.

00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:57.100
And yet as her brother,

00:38:57.150 --> 00:38:58.280
I could only watch

00:38:58.280 --> 00:38:59.480
as she walked straight

00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:00.320
toward ruin.

00:39:01.030 --> 00:39:03.150
She's the Princess of Susha.

00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:05.710
How is she supposed to fend for herself

00:39:05.710 --> 00:39:06.840
in Jinxiu all alone?

00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:09.930
Whatever the future holds,

00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:12.110
at least she's safe now.

00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:14.320
The two nations just made peace.

00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:15.110
Xia Jingshi

00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:16.670
wouldn't dare harm her.

00:39:22.630 --> 00:39:23.830
Don't think too much.

00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:25.260
We'll head back

00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:26.880
to Yujing at first light.

00:39:28.510 --> 00:39:29.640
I haven't asked you—

00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:31.190
you shot all those arrows

00:39:31.190 --> 00:39:32.400
from so far away today.

00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:33.330
How's your hand?

00:39:34.190 --> 00:39:34.920
It's fine.

00:39:35.070 --> 00:39:36.600
I didn't use much strength.

00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:38.340
Don't lie to me.

00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:40.410
It's too windy here.

00:39:40.510 --> 00:39:41.910
Let's go back to the tent.

00:39:42.590 --> 00:39:43.190
Let me see.

00:39:45.670 --> 00:39:46.560
What's wrong?

00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:48.360
Nothing. Let's just go.

00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:49.140
Don't move.

00:39:53.630 --> 00:39:54.630
It's really fine.

00:39:55.310 --> 00:39:56.340
Stop looking.

00:39:59.110 --> 00:40:00.560
You call this fine?

00:40:02.630 --> 00:40:03.630
It's really fine.

00:40:04.590 --> 00:40:05.760
Can you even move your hand?

00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:06.880
Don't make a fuss.

00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:08.190
It'll heal in a few days.

00:40:08.190 --> 00:40:09.320
Did you forget

00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:10.320
what Lord Ling told you?

00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:11.760
I couldn't care about that.

00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:12.510
I couldn't just stand by

00:40:12.510 --> 00:40:13.480
and watch you get hurt.

00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:14.920
And I can't just stand by and watch you

00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:15.590
become a wreck

00:40:15.590 --> 00:40:16.400
trying to protect me.

00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:17.480
So what if I'm a wreck?

00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:18.810
You think I'm a wreck now

00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:19.760
and despise me?

00:40:22.070 --> 00:40:23.440
Feng Suige, listen carefully.

00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:24.360
Even if I become a wreck,

00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:25.550
I won't regret it.

00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:27.860
Because I've long had a thing for you.
