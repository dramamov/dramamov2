[Fated Hearts]

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.990
[Episode 20]

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.610
The person who took Ruyan's carriage

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:48.840
to meet Xia Jingshi

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.300
was actually
in the Murong Marquis mansion.

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:54.840
The benefactor Ruyan mentioned

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.600
turned out to be Murong Yao.

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:24.470
Let's go.

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.310
You're letting me go?

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.470
Yes.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.030
Why?

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.960
I've already found out

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.690
who that Meng Junran really is.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.870
Impossible.

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.470
The Murong Marquis mansion.

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:54.240
Do you need me

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.370
to be more specific?

00:02:58.079 --> 00:02:59.740
You're deeply devoted to him.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.360
But he didn't even bother to find out

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.760
if you betrayed him or not

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.800
before sending someone to kill you.

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:06.830
It shows that in his heart

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:07.560
you're just

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.220
an insignificant character.

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:12.000
After all this,

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:13.310
you should see

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:14.640
his true colours by now.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:15.310
He doesn't deserve

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:16.640
any of your attachment.

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.050
Don't talk about dying so easily.

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:20.520
Live well.

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:22.590
After you leave this place,

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.050
you'll still be in danger.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.520
He will surely send people
to hunt you down.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:27.500
Don't go back to the dance house.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:28.900
Don't look for him again.

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:34.750
Leave Yujing City

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:36.600
and start a new life.

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.520
Before I change my mind,

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:43.930
you'd better leave.

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:47.079
Hurry and leave!

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:14.150
Feng Suige asked you

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:15.880
about the escort agency today?

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:17.480
As you instructed before,

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.930
I said it was commissioned by Manager Luo.

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.870
Manager Luo's lead is a dead end.

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.330
He can't answer anything.

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.000
Your Lordship, you been tired all day.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.720
May I massage your legs?

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:33.190
No need.

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:35.220
All these years,

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.240
you've never asked what I want to do

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:38.370
or what I wish to do.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:39.930
Aren't you curious?

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.240
No matter what Your Lordship wants to do

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.100
or wishes to do,

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:45.720
I will

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.180
forever stay by your side.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:08.160
Young Master,

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.240
don't go!

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:12.480
All right.

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.290
Let me see what we'll eat later.

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:15.270
Stop looking.

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:16.270
-Let's go there.
-Let's go there.

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.800
Go.

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.130
-Okay.
-Go there. Okay.

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:18.830
Hurry!

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:43.070
Someone's coming.

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.600
Retreat!

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.310
You want to die?

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:31.310
It's not that easy.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.120
Feng Suige.

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:34.870
Don't be happy too soon.

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:36.750
Your doomsday

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.070
is coming.

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:40.430
How come the mighty death camp.

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:41.240
only

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:44.360
have this few people?

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:01.430
Take them away.

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:02.120
-Yes.
-Yes.

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:10.220
Your Highness.

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:12.360
I've checked the surroundings

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:14.090
and found nothing suspicious.

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:21.720
[Wutong Mansion]

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:33.200
Your Highness.

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:35.840
Let's use every torture device we have.

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:37.170
She'll surely confess.

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:42.360
Wake her up.

00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:44.850
Salt water.

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:01.560
The Minister of War of Susha

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.200
had no grudges against your death camp.

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:06.260
You killed him

00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:07.600
just for him

00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:09.560
to be a scapegoat and shield.

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.330
Everyone at court knows

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:12.720
Hou Jing is my man.

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:14.360
If something happens to him,

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:16.160
I'll be isolated at court.

00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:17.830
The position of Minister of War

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:18.830
will be vacant.

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:20.190
Your master

00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:24.130
can then seize the opportunity
to appoint someone new.

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:27.760
The affairs of Susha's court

00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:29.770
have nothing to do with me.

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:37.549
So Zhuang Shen sent you, did he?

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:40.320
Kill me if you want.

00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:42.090
Stop wasting time.

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:52.960
I wonder.

00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:54.870
You can withstand them,

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.840
but can your subordinates withstand

00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:59.290
these tortures of mine?

00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:06.770
Your Highness.

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:09.120
He confessed?

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:09.900
Yes, he did.

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:10.960
I thought that man

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:12.120
would be tough to break.

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:13.850
But as soon as the nails went in,

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:15.330
he confessed everything.

00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:36.030
He's dead?

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:37.840
He kept muttering from the moment
we brought them in,

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:38.840
like he was chanting a spell.

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:40.060
Your Highness, I feel these people

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:41.120
are all a bit mentally unstable.

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:42.670
I'm asking how he died.

00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:44.750
He confessed after just a brief beating.

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:45.510
Said it was someone

00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:47.030
named Meng Junran who gave the order.

00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:47.600
"Your Eminence"

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:48.790
instructed before leaving Yujing

00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:50.550
to obey everything Meng Junran says.

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:51.550
"Your Eminence"?

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:52.850
That's Xia Jingshi.

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:55.150
I thought we were getting somewhere,

00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:56.000
but this guy

00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:56.890
was just trying

00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:58.960
to mislead me even when confessing.

00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:00.120
When I wasn't looking,

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:01.440
he smashed his head and died.

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:02.750
The more I hear, the more I think

00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:03.510
this death camp is complicated.

00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:04.000
These assassins

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.320
have been trained to be inhuman.

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:07.120
They're completely heartless.

00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:10.790
Where's the body?

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:11.960
Still in the cell.

Why is it you?

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:04.320
I've been following you

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:04.870
just to see

00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:06.000
how you would leave.

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:07.030
I didn't think you would

00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:08.600
still go to Murong Marquis's mansion.

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:09.480
What's more surprising is

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:11.540
that you wanted to take your own life.

00:11:13.450 --> 00:11:14.550
Why did you save me?

00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:16.420
Wouldn't it be better to let me die?

00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:17.360
Die for him?

00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:18.350
Is it worth it?

00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:20.310
If you jump from here now,

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:21.200
tomorrow Yujing City

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:22.510
will just have one more floating corpse.

00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:23.970
Nothing else will change.

00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:24.870
In his heart,

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:26.200
you're already dead.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:32.720
Dead...

00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:33.440
Actually, that day

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:35.000
when I tracked you
to Murong Marquis's mansion,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:35.720
I already knew

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:36.850
Meng Junran was him.

00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:38.270
I just hoped

00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:38.910
to hear you

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:39.840
say his name.

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:41.600
Because only then

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:42.970
could it prove that

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.460
you had already let him go.

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:47.440
I'm not someone

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:49.080
who meddles in others' affairs.

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:51.000
It's only because
we share similar experiences.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.660
The suffering I once endured,

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:53.720
I don't want it

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:54.840
to happen to you.

00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:59.000
I just don't understand.

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:00.960
How could someone I'd rather die

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:02.320
than to betray

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:06.200
be so cruel to me?

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:11.400
His heartlessness is his fault.

00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:13.320
Don't blame it on yourself.

00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:15.440
But is the reason you'd rather die

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:16.400
than betray him

00:12:17.390 --> 00:12:19.590
just because you have feelings for him?

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:21.520
If it weren't for him,

00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:24.320
I wouldn't be alive today.

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:27.400
I grew up in the dance house.

00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:29.930
Since young, I had to suffer
countless hardships

00:12:29.930 --> 00:12:31.590
and endur countless beatings

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:33.930
to become the top dancer in the house.

00:12:35.270 --> 00:12:37.870
At the same time,
I became my mother's cash cow.

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:41.240
You have to entertain clients.

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:44.840
I despised that life.

00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:47.710
But I couldn't change anything.

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:50.030
Just when I had lost all hope

00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:52.030
and wished to end my life,

00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:54.630
he came.

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:57.880
He was like a beam of light

00:12:58.290 --> 00:12:59.270
shining upon me.

00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:01.480
Later,

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:04.480
he gave me the dance house

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:07.630
and made me its owner.

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:09.390
He saved you.

00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:13.030
Your unwillingness to betray him
even at the cost of your life

00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:14.160
is understandable.

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:15.540
At the dance house,

00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:16.630
I helped him collect

00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:18.830
intelligence on officials and nobles.

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:20.200
You know what?

00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:22.870
Everyone saw me as

00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:23.970
a lowly dancer.

00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:25.600
Only he

00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:28.630
never looked down on my background.

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:30.890
Whatever debt you owed him,

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:32.790
it was cleared

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:34.550
the moment he sent someone to kill you.

00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:35.390
From now on,

00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:37.810
live for yourself.

00:13:39.510 --> 00:13:40.720
Live for myself?

00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:28.200
Who is this Meng Junran?

00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:43.230
Your Eminence told you to listen to him.

00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:45.140
You can't possibly not know

00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:46.140
who he is, can you?

00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:47.770
I don't know.

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:50.150
Then it seems your subordinates

00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:51.130
were right.

00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:52.790
Prime Minister Zhuang these days

00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:54.520
has been staying in the palace.

00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:56.260
So he couldn't have had the chance

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:57.670
to give you orders.

00:14:58.240 --> 00:14:59.900
So it must be this Meng Junran.

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:02.550
Tell me his identity.

00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:04.240
I can spare your life.

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:07.550
Why?

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:10.040
You don't believe me?

00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:12.270
Members of the death camp

00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:14.550
never betray.

00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:17.550
Because death for them

00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:20.630
is an extreme luxury.

00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:23.080
Without permission,

00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:25.240
taking one's own life

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:27.780
means no reincarnation after death.

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:31.030
When captured by enemies,
to prove loyalty,

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:33.390
only suicide brings release.

00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:36.550
You think these little tricks

00:15:36.550 --> 00:15:37.790
can fool me?

00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:40.910
I truly don't know

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:42.290
Meng Junran's identity

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:44.080
As for the reason

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:46.440
why His Eminence sent us
to complete this mission

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:47.720
or what his plans are,

00:15:48.630 --> 00:15:50.630
we're merely following orders.

00:15:51.390 --> 00:15:52.520
These are the rules.

00:15:53.510 --> 00:15:54.670
People from the death camp

00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:56.000
understand rules best.

00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:01.600
However,

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:04.600
I have something else

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:05.720
to tell you.

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:10.240
You'll find it very interesting.

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:11.390
Go on.

00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:16.390
Once,

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:19.000
there was a little girl.

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:21.120
When I first saw her,

00:16:21.510 --> 00:16:23.360
she was like a little stray dog.

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:25.630
I only needed one flatbread

00:16:25.630 --> 00:16:26.600
to lure her back to

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:28.110
my death camp

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:30.740
All these years,

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:32.750
I often dream of her,

00:16:33.510 --> 00:16:34.870
dream of all the moments

00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:37.080
we spent together.

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:39.550
She was so tiny.

00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:41.360
All covered in blood.

00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:42.870
She would kneel down

00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:44.200
and kowtow to me saying,

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:45.630
"I'm sorry.

00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:47.000
I'm sorry."

00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:52.440
But she

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:55.700
should be grateful to me, shouldn't she?

00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:57.320
Without me,

00:16:57.670 --> 00:16:59.740
how could she have
such great martial skills now?

00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:00.480
People can only

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:01.670
unleash their unlimited potential

00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:03.440
when they're close to death.

00:17:03.510 --> 00:17:05.000
I would hold her underwater

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.270
and then save her.

00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:09.440
Breath control.

00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:11.270
What a master archer needs most

00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:12.329
is breath control.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.369
Without proper breath control and focus,

00:17:15.790 --> 00:17:17.849
how could she ever shoot accurately?

00:17:18.069 --> 00:17:20.400
How could she become the deadliest arrow?

00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:23.440
Then,

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:26.900
I locked her in the cellar.

00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:30.440
Do you know

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:33.240
what total darkness is like?

00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:37.080
She didn't see the sun for six months.

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:38.720
During those six months,

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:41.300
if a few rats got in,

00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:44.110
she would be deeply grateful to me.

00:17:44.610 --> 00:17:45.670
There was no sound.

00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:47.480
No sound.

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:50.660
Not a single sound.

00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:54.820
Your Highness,

00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:58.510
do you know who I'm talking about?

00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:27.650
You think angering me

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:29.200
will make me kill you?

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:30.830
When it comes to tactics,

00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:32.920
you may be even more ruthless

00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:34.110
and cruel than I am.

00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:35.350
You also know better than anyone

00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:36.480
what kind of torture

00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:38.400
awaits you.

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:41.480
So you want to end it all,

00:18:42.550 --> 00:18:44.750
thinking you can escape the suffering.

00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:52.790
You even try to end your life
by biting your tongue off.

00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:54.670
But I won't let you have your way.

00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:58.270
I'll make you regret

00:18:58.270 --> 00:19:00.230
ever being born.

00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:38.030
The Junior Marquis of Changle

00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:39.720
is His Highness' childhood friend.

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:41.650
They're as close as real brothers.

00:19:46.030 --> 00:19:47.610
And the old nursemaid

00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:50.440
who'd been with me since I was born.

00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:52.700
To win favor with my enemy,

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:54.000
she tried

00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:56.270
to burn me alive in my sleep.

00:19:57.510 --> 00:19:59.440
Even my childhood study companion

00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:01.170
And my swordsmanship teacher…

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:03.350
They all used my trust

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:04.550
and tried every possible way

00:20:04.550 --> 00:20:05.960
to kill me.

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:09.750
If you knew that

00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:11.510
even your close friend of many years

00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:12.510
had betrayed you,

00:20:13.810 --> 00:20:15.270
how painful would that be?

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:47.340
Your Highness.

00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:49.070
This is the inner palace garden.

00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:50.130
Outside officials

00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:51.840
are not allowed to enter.

00:20:52.830 --> 00:20:54.430
Wait outside with Princess.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.440
I'll go meet the Empress Dowager.

00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:57.070
Your Highness,

00:20:57.070 --> 00:20:58.070
we've entered the palace.

00:20:58.070 --> 00:20:59.350
Instead of greeting the Emperor first,

00:20:59.350 --> 00:21:01.070
we are meeting the Empress Dowager?

00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:03.240
Let me meet the Empress Dowager with you.

00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:04.240
If she gives you trouble,

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:05.440
I'll explain for you.

00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:07.640
It's good for Her Highness to come along.

00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:09.720
After all, leaving Susha
without permission

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:11.180
requires an explanation.

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:13.240
I can explain to her clearly

00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:15.040
why both of us had to leave Susha.

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:18.680
When we meet the Empress Dowager,

00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:19.680
whatever she asks you,

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:21.000
just answer truthfully.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:21.730
Don't worry.

00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:31.290
[Shunde Palace]

00:21:38.550 --> 00:21:39.350
Your Majesty,

00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:42.060
the Prince of Zhennan and his wife
have arrived.

00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:44.490
You may leave.

00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:51.810
I pay my respects, Mother.

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:02.400
Rise.

00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:04.170
Thank you, Mother.

00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:09.270
So this is your new wife,

00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:10.850
the Princess of Susha?

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:13.680
Since the Emperor promised Susha

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:15.680
that you would be their son-in-law,

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:18.210
why did you disobey
and return to the capital?

00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:19.320
You even brought

00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:21.080
the Princess of Susha with you.

00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:22.920
Our countries have just made peace.

00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:24.650
Are you trying to provoke a war?

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:27.550
As the Commander-in-Chief of Zhennan Pass,

00:22:27.550 --> 00:22:29.270
if I were detained in Susha indefinitely,

00:22:29.270 --> 00:22:30.070
I fear the Zhennan Army

00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:32.270
would lose morale and fighting spirit.

00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:33.590
I risked my life to return

00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:34.650
was all for Jinxiu,

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:36.370
So you're saying

00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:38.350
that sending you to Susha as a son-in-law

00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:40.070
was a mistake by the Emperor and me?

00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:40.710
Mother,

00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:42.390
I never meant that.

00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:45.460
You've grown bolder

00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:47.680
and making your own decisions now.

00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:48.440
You dare to disobey

00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:49.770
both me and the Emperor.

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:51.130
I wouldn't dare.

00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:52.590
I wouldn't dare to defy

00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:54.790
your or His Majesty's wishes in any way.

00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:56.830
Please understand, Your Highness.

00:22:56.830 --> 00:22:58.830
All these years the Prince of Zhennan
spent in Pingling City,

00:22:58.830 --> 00:22:59.680
he dedicated every thought

00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:01.590
to defending the borders
and protecting the country.

00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:03.590
He has no selfish intentions whatsoever.

00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:04.830
These words coming

00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:06.880
from an enemy princess's mouth.

00:23:07.770 --> 00:23:09.570
How can I possibly believe them?

00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:10.930
If it weren't true,

00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:11.960
I wouldn't have willingly

00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:13.440
angered my father and brothers

00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:14.200
just to help the Prince of Zhennan

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:15.250
return to Jinxiu.

00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:18.030
So you're saying

00:23:18.030 --> 00:23:19.030
I should thank you

00:23:19.030 --> 00:23:20.430
for your righteousness?

00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:23.480
You, leave.

00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:25.130
I need to speak

00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:26.560
with your husband alone.

00:23:48.270 --> 00:23:50.870
Back then, to escape from Jinxiu,

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:52.750
you called me Mother.

00:23:53.270 --> 00:23:55.760
Now, to escape from Susha,

00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:57.440
you didn't hesitate to bring

00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:59.030
that enemy princess with you.

00:23:59.030 --> 00:24:00.240
Have you figured out how to explain this

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:01.750
to your Red-Clad General?

00:24:04.030 --> 00:24:04.550
What?

00:24:05.790 --> 00:24:06.550
You don't actually think

00:24:06.550 --> 00:24:08.480
I don't know what you've been doing

00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:10.080
in Pingling City, do you?

00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:13.480
These years,

00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:15.210
you've done well at the border.

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:17.200
Pingling City has been governed

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:19.200
with perfect order under your rule.

00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:20.980
The several invasions from Susha

00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:22.440
were also repelled by you.

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:24.290
Now throughout the court,

00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:27.550
who doesn't know the reputation
of the Prince of Zhennan?

00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:31.510
It's all thanks to your nurturing, Mother.

00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:35.030
You also have the blood
of the late emperor.

00:24:35.030 --> 00:24:36.720
You're Jinxiu's only Prince.

00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:39.410
The Emperor is a carefree man.

00:24:42.270 --> 00:24:43.790
Jinxiu's grand affairs

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:46.130
shall rely on you in the future.

00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:49.720
Don't let

00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:51.240
my nurturing go to waste.

00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:15.470
Has someone wronged you?

00:25:15.550 --> 00:25:17.010
Tell me who bullied you.

00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:18.840
I'll make them regret it.

00:25:19.030 --> 00:25:19.640
Remember,

00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:22.800
after you're married,
no matter what happens,

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:24.520
you must let Father know.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.230
I'll always be your support.

00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:28.860
The entire Susha

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:29.050
is your backing.

00:25:29.050 --> 00:25:30.240
♪ Roaming freely ♪

00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:30.720

I can accept anything.

00:25:35.070 --> 00:25:36.240
Because more than anyone else

00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:36.560
in this world,

00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:37.510

00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:38.620

Who is this?

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.060
Dare to not kneel before His Majesty?

00:26:05.270 --> 00:26:06.220
Who are you?

00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:07.330
Raise your head.

00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:15.910
Your Majesty.

00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:17.720
This is the wife of the Prince of Zhennan.

00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:19.850
Xiyang pays respects to Your Majesty.

00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:21.310
Well, well,

00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:23.420
Xia Jingshi has returned.

00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:34.310
You have the nerve to come back?

00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:34.790
Stop!

00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:38.000
Stop!

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.600
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:44.040
Your Majesty.

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:45.700
What are you doing?

00:26:47.030 --> 00:26:48.230
I'm going to kill him.

00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:49.070
Your Majesty!

00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:49.830
You absolutely cannot!

00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:50.400
You must not!

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:51.330
Get out of my way!

00:26:51.790 --> 00:26:52.300
Enough!

00:26:52.510 --> 00:26:53.640
Stop this nonsense.

00:26:55.070 --> 00:26:56.800
Your brother has just returned

00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:59.110
and you're already threatening
to kill him.

00:26:59.110 --> 00:27:01.070
How would this look if word got out?

00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:03.350
If he has done something wrong,

00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:05.150
you should address it properly.

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:06.790
Let him admit the wrongs himself.

00:27:06.790 --> 00:27:08.110
The royal family's dignity

00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:10.240
has been completely disgraced by you.

00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:14.920
Mother.

00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:16.720
I made my own decision

00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:18.200
to leave Susha without permission

00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:19.750
because I was forced by circumstances.

00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:21.550
I couldn't report to you in time.

00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:23.030
But everything I've done

00:27:23.030 --> 00:27:24.030
was for Jinxiu,

00:27:25.110 --> 00:27:26.310
and for Your Majesty.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.480
I had no selfish intentions.

00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:29.730
Stop pretending.

00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:31.830
A lowborn like you

00:27:32.550 --> 00:27:33.720
dares to stand before Mother

00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:35.180
and call yourself her son?

00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:36.210
Let me tell you,

00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:37.910
killing you now

00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:39.900
would be like crushing an ant.

00:27:41.310 --> 00:27:42.310
Enough of this.

00:27:47.950 --> 00:27:49.590
Prince of Zhennan, you've come from afar.

00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:50.350
I assume you haven't arranged

00:27:50.350 --> 00:27:51.590
your accommodations yet.

00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:52.570
In my opinion,

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.800
he should stay at the Rongyang Palace
in the north.

00:27:56.750 --> 00:27:57.550
Bai Shouzhuo,

00:27:57.830 --> 00:27:58.890
escort them there.

00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:01.220
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:03.820
Please follow me, both of you.

00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:08.120
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:10.090
Mother,

00:28:10.510 --> 00:28:11.910
I shall take my leave now.

00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:15.480
Please.

00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:26.920
Prime Minister.

00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:30.880
Minister Hou has been seriously wounded
in an assassination attempt.

00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:32.590
The Ministry of War is now leaderless

00:28:32.590 --> 00:28:33.750
and is in complete disarray.

00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:35.030
What should we do?

00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:38.880
Prime Minister Zhuang.

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:40.110
The most urgent matter now

00:28:40.110 --> 00:28:41.920
is to immediately select an official

00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:43.390
to replace the Minister.

00:28:43.790 --> 00:28:44.630
Censor Wang,

00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:45.940
who do you have in mind?

00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:47.790
Liu Qin, the Vice Minister of War.

00:28:47.790 --> 00:28:49.680
He has served as Deputy Minister
for over five years

00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:51.270
without making any mistakes.

00:28:51.270 --> 00:28:53.070
Having him replace the Minister

00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:54.770
would be most appropriate.

00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:57.050
I recommend the official
from the Minister of War,

00:28:57.050 --> 00:28:58.150
Zhao Zhongxian.

00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:00.480
Lord Zhao is well-versed in state affairs,

00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:01.510
skilled in both civil
and military matters.

00:29:01.510 --> 00:29:03.720
Your Majesty has praised him many times.

00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:05.780
He is truly a talent worth employing.

00:29:06.030 --> 00:29:08.150
Lord Zhao is indeed talented,

00:29:08.270 --> 00:29:09.560
but he is quite young.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.960
If we appoint him as the Minister,

00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:14.310
I fear others may not accept
his authority.

00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:16.960
How about Minister Li Rongshi
from the Ministry of Works?

00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:19.010
He could transfer from Works to War.

00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:20.310
That would be acceptable.

00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:22.200
Indeed, Minister Li would be
more suitable.

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:24.680
But Deputy Minister Liu is more familiar

00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:27.030
with the affairs of the Ministry of War.

00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:29.600
I have heard

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:30.850
what you all said.

00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:32.990
I need to think carefully

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.840
about these three candidates.

00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:53.030
Father.

00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:58.960
Whether it's Left Vice Minister Liu Qin,

00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:00.610
physician Zhao Zhongxian,

00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:01.910
or Li Rongshi,

00:30:02.030 --> 00:30:03.360
they are all our people.

00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:05.740
How is His Majesty?

00:30:07.790 --> 00:30:08.590
I don't know when

00:30:08.590 --> 00:30:09.450
he will wake up.

00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:14.590
You ordered him back

00:30:14.790 --> 00:30:15.920
just to kill him?

00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:17.540
I don't care.

00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:19.680
I feel disgusted just looking at him.

00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:21.140
I want to kill him on sight.

00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:22.270
Anyway, Mother

00:30:22.830 --> 00:30:24.350
won't let me actually do it,

00:30:24.350 --> 00:30:24.920
right?

00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:26.790
Stop causing me trouble.

00:30:27.030 --> 00:30:27.790
He now commands

00:30:27.790 --> 00:30:28.990
over 100,000 troops.

00:30:29.130 --> 00:30:30.660
If anything happens to him,

00:30:30.750 --> 00:30:31.790
the army from Pingling City

00:30:31.790 --> 00:30:32.920
will storm the capital.

00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:33.960
I should have killed

00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:34.790
that bastard back then.

00:30:34.790 --> 00:30:35.710
It was you.

00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:37.110
You were bewitched by his constant calls

00:30:37.110 --> 00:30:38.480
of 'Mother' and lost all senses.

00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:40.160
You insisted on letting him go.

00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:41.090
All these years,

00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:42.750
he's been fighting wars and gaining merit.

00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:43.640
I've been mocked

00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:45.500
as just a capital-bound emperor.

00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:47.610
Now you fear him

00:30:48.270 --> 00:30:50.200
and think I'm causing you trouble?

00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:52.070
He is a bastard.

00:30:52.790 --> 00:30:54.350
You are my true son.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:56.400
But you are incompetent!

00:30:57.480 --> 00:30:57.880
I...

00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:00.260
If you want to secure your throne,

00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:01.920
if you want to spend your days
in debauchery

00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:02.960
and do whatever you please,

00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:04.800
you must rely on Xia Jingshi.

00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:06.930
With him here,

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:08.680
Zhennan Pass will remain secure.

00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:09.680
Those old ministers at court

00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:11.260
won't dare to make trouble.

00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:13.080
He does have the ability,

00:31:13.830 --> 00:31:15.030
but he lacks loyalty.

00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:17.280
He may look like a dog now,

00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:18.030
but did you see

00:31:18.030 --> 00:31:19.510
that look in his eyes just now?

00:31:19.510 --> 00:31:20.930
He's a wolf cub.

00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:22.710
He will bite sooner or later.

00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:25.960
I naturally have ways to control him

00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:28.030
and make him bow

00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:29.400
to us, mother and son.

00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:36.880
This way, please.

00:31:42.970 --> 00:31:47.160
[Rongyang Palace]

00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:48.790
This place is different
from other palace gardens.

00:31:48.790 --> 00:31:50.070
It's where palace eunuchs

00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:51.670
recover before their death.

00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:52.920
Ordinary people are not allowed here,

00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:54.050
hence it's guarded.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.590
Xia Jingyan deliberately humiliates

00:31:58.590 --> 00:31:59.480
Your Highness.

00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:00.510
Shut up.

00:32:03.550 --> 00:32:05.750
But this place has been uninhabited
for years.

00:32:05.750 --> 00:32:07.410
My lady, please don't mind it.

00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:17.170
Your Highness.

00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:18.480
Please.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:53.530
Be careful, Your Highness.

00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:55.880
Are you alright, Your Highness?

00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:56.590
Did you twist your ankle?

00:32:56.590 --> 00:32:57.450
My foot is fine.

00:32:57.960 --> 00:32:59.090
I was just careless.

00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:02.880
How can they let His Highness

00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:04.280
stay in a place like this?

00:33:04.830 --> 00:33:05.510
I'm afraid there isn't even

00:33:05.510 --> 00:33:07.000
a clean table or chair.

00:33:07.790 --> 00:33:09.390
Don't worry, Your Highness.

00:33:09.510 --> 00:33:11.110
Our conditions in the military

00:33:11.110 --> 00:33:12.710
were much harsher than this.

00:33:13.110 --> 00:33:14.720
You needn't worry about His Highness.

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:16.000
He's just going in to see

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.350
if it has been tidied up yet.

00:33:17.350 --> 00:33:18.680
We'll wait for him here.

00:33:41.550 --> 00:33:43.080
Your Highness, please sit.

00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:56.740
Your Highness.

00:33:57.510 --> 00:33:59.350
Shouzhe has finally waited

00:33:59.350 --> 00:34:00.360
for your return.

00:34:16.630 --> 00:34:17.550
Looking at his condition,

00:34:17.550 --> 00:34:18.730
I fear he won't last through the night.

00:34:18.730 --> 00:34:19.730
Who can blame him?

00:34:20.030 --> 00:34:21.480
He broke Her Majesty's

00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:22.550
favorite vase.

00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:50.370
All these years,

00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:52.969
you've suffered much.

00:34:53.590 --> 00:34:54.320
Please rise.

00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:57.730
I didn't suffer.

00:34:58.280 --> 00:34:59.320
I am now

00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:01.470
the Emperor's head eunuch.

00:35:01.510 --> 00:35:03.230
I can act freely. No one dares to stop me.

00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:04.440
If Your Highness has any requests,

00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:06.100
please don't hesitate to ask.

00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:07.670
Following your instructions,

00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:08.510
I didn't accompany Your Highness

00:35:08.510 --> 00:35:09.630
to Pingling.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.400
Every day I've been here,

00:35:12.590 --> 00:35:13.110
I've been waiting

00:35:13.110 --> 00:35:14.190
for your return.

00:35:15.150 --> 00:35:17.400
During these years I've been away
from the capital,

00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:18.400
there were indeed many matters

00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:20.200
that required your assistance.

00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:22.250
But you must be extremely careful.

00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:24.880
Xia Jingyan is cunning and ruthless.

00:35:25.110 --> 00:35:25.960
We absolutely cannot let him

00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:27.020
suspect anything.

00:35:27.070 --> 00:35:27.870
I understand.

00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:30.000
Since learning of your return,

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:31.320
I've copied these documents

00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:32.430
and kept them ready.

00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:34.960
I'm sure Your Highness will find them useful.

00:35:39.730 --> 00:35:41.000
[Xia Jingyan’s Daily Chronicle]

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:41.600
This is...

00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:44.510
Xia Jingyan’s Daily Chronicle?

00:35:47.110 --> 00:35:48.020
With this,

00:35:48.790 --> 00:35:51.170
Xia Jingyan will have no secrets from me.

00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:57.220
[Wutong Mansion]

00:35:57.220 --> 00:35:59.480
Murong Yao has people watching closely.

00:36:00.190 --> 00:36:01.360
I can't act rashly.

00:36:24.110 --> 00:36:24.920
I've been

00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:25.880
a pampered prince since childhood.

00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:27.550
I've never led troops nor fought in battle.

00:36:27.550 --> 00:36:28.280
His Majesty has passed the command

00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:29.320
of the Imperial Guards to me.

00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:30.980
Isn't that asking for my life?

00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:32.170
Do you know

00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:35.290
what it means
to live in complete darkness?

00:36:36.670 --> 00:36:38.950
She didn't see the sun for half a year.

00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:40.510
During those six months,

00:36:40.510 --> 00:36:42.920
if a few rats had gotten in,

00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:45.980
she would have been grateful to me.

00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:48.550
What are you thinking about?

00:36:48.550 --> 00:36:49.760
You've been preoccupied the whole journey.

00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:52.020
You don't even respond when I talk to you.

00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:54.150
Your father fought battles his whole life.

00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:56.190
You're considered to be
from a military family.

00:36:56.190 --> 00:36:58.000
How hard can it be
for you to lead the Imperial Guards?

00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.590
You handle military affairs
as if having a meal.

00:36:59.590 --> 00:37:00.400
You're used to it.

00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:01.880
I've never endured such hardship.

00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:02.630
Every day when I open my eyes,

00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:03.800
I'm overwhelmed with military affairs.

00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:04.710
It's driving me crazy.

00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:06.510
I even wrote my resignation letter.

00:37:06.510 --> 00:37:07.960
But then His Majesty suddenly fell ill.

00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:09.360
I didn't even get a chance to resign.

00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:10.800
Before His Majesty wakes up,

00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:11.920
the Imperial Guards' duty

00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:13.710
is to ensure the palace's security.

00:37:13.710 --> 00:37:15.200
Don't neglect your duties

00:37:15.230 --> 00:37:16.320
by sneaking out again.

00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:17.650
You know me well enough,

00:37:17.710 --> 00:37:19.370
I can't stand being confined.

00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:21.150
How about

00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:23.600
you take charge of the Imperial Guards
for a few days?

00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:24.510
Until His Majesty wakes up,

00:37:24.510 --> 00:37:25.550
you'll stay in the palace.

00:37:25.550 --> 00:37:26.510
I'll send all matters
of the Imperial Guards

00:37:26.510 --> 00:37:27.360
to the palace.

00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:29.010
Handle them for you.

00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:29.710
I...

00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:30.230
Fine.

00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:31.580
I'll take that as a yes.

00:37:32.370 --> 00:37:33.360
You truly are my good brother.

00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:34.400
I knew you would help me.

00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:35.630
Don't push it too far.

00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:38.360
General.

00:37:39.670 --> 00:37:40.630
From now on, report all matters
about the Imperial Guards

00:37:40.630 --> 00:37:41.870
directly to him.

00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:43.630
Prime Minister Zhuang wants
to arrest Ling Feng,

00:37:43.630 --> 00:37:44.800
but Mr. Ma won't allow it.

00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:45.710
I'm afraid our Imperial Guards

00:37:45.710 --> 00:37:47.570
will clash with the Jinwu Guards.

00:37:55.110 --> 00:37:56.440
Are you threatening me?

00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:57.630
For him,

00:37:57.710 --> 00:37:58.630
you employ the Jinwu Guards

00:37:58.630 --> 00:37:59.900
to oppose me?

00:38:00.590 --> 00:38:01.520
I wouldn't dare.

00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:02.730
However,

00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:03.840
I must ensure

00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:05.600
Lord Ling remains unharmed.

00:38:06.110 --> 00:38:07.040
Only if he's safe

00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:08.680
can His Majesty be saved.

00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:11.230
What are you doing?

00:38:11.230 --> 00:38:11.890
Step aside.

00:38:27.110 --> 00:38:28.640
What's the meaning of this?

00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:30.590
How does it feel to have a knife

00:38:30.590 --> 00:38:31.480
at your throat?

00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:34.620
Making such jokes in the imperial palace

00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:36.630
seems inappropriate, doesn't it?

00:38:36.630 --> 00:38:38.110
In the imperial palace,

00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:40.720
who are you to tell me what to do?

00:38:41.150 --> 00:38:41.880
I merely want

00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:43.680
to ask Lord Ling some questions.

00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:45.760
This matter doesn't concern you.

00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:47.440
I brought him here

00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:48.630
to treat His Majesty.

00:38:48.630 --> 00:38:50.360
Anyone who dares to trouble him

00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:52.070
is opposing me.

00:38:57.190 --> 00:38:59.050
Your Highness, please calm down.

00:38:59.110 --> 00:39:00.280
It's because Lord Ling

00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:01.590
refuses to disclose

00:39:01.590 --> 00:39:02.710
His Majesty's condition.

00:39:02.710 --> 00:39:04.820
I've examined His Majesty's

00:39:04.850 --> 00:39:06.840
recent medication records

00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:10.520
and found the prescribed medicines
quite strange.

00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:12.670
What's strange about them?

00:39:12.670 --> 00:39:13.550
Speak clearly.

00:39:14.030 --> 00:39:15.610
The medicines recorded

00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:18.020
are all for treating mental exhaustion.

00:39:18.230 --> 00:39:20.510
If His Majesty's illness

00:39:20.510 --> 00:39:21.590
were caused by mental fatigue,

00:39:21.590 --> 00:39:22.880
he certainly wouldn't

00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:24.110
remain unconscious for so long.

00:39:24.110 --> 00:39:24.760
Moreover,

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:26.360
with Lord Ling's medical skills,

00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:27.810
he should have already

00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:29.480
awakened His Majesty by now.

00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:30.920
Besides Mr. Ma,

00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:32.510
the last person His Majesty saw

00:39:32.510 --> 00:39:34.570
before falling unconscious was you.

00:39:34.710 --> 00:39:35.840
Shortly after that,

00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:38.360
you brought Lord Ling into the palace.

00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:39.190
He took over all matters

00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:41.250
regarding His Majesty's treatment.

00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:44.670
Yet His Majesty remains unconscious
for days.

00:39:44.670 --> 00:39:47.070
Now the entire court is asking me

00:39:47.590 --> 00:39:49.250
what happened to His Majesty.

00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:50.640
First Prince,

00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:52.230
tell me,

00:39:53.030 --> 00:39:54.880
how should I answer them?

00:39:56.960 --> 00:39:57.690
Zhuang Shen,

00:39:59.150 --> 00:40:00.750
what are you implying?

00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:02.550
I'm merely stating facts.

00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:03.630
Lord Ling,

00:40:04.070 --> 00:40:05.330
why are you so nervous?

00:40:05.630 --> 00:40:06.960
Are you feeling guilty?

00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:10.280
I don't usually see anyone at court

00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:12.410
care so much about His Majesty before.

00:40:12.710 --> 00:40:14.110
If anyone has questions,

00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:15.910
let them ask me directly.

00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:18.170
You're known as the Killer God.

00:40:18.710 --> 00:40:20.310
Who would dare question you?

00:40:23.710 --> 00:40:24.960
Are you all so eager to know

00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:26.820
what illness Feng Pingcheng has?

00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:28.810
Absolutely not!

00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:29.590
Absolutely not,

00:40:29.590 --> 00:40:30.280
Lord Ling!

00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:32.970
He has a terminal illness.

00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:35.890
It's incurable.

00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:37.520
Even gods couldn't save him.

00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:39.800
Last March,

00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:40.400
May the year before,

00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:41.920
October three years ago...

00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:43.460
I've lost count.

00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:45.550
If I hadn't been keeping him alive,

00:40:45.550 --> 00:40:47.080
he would have died long ago!

00:40:47.150 --> 00:40:47.840
Lord Ling.

00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:48.450
You...

00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:49.610
I'll say what I want.

00:40:51.670 --> 00:40:53.070
I don't owe you anything.

00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:55.710
Find whoever you want to treat him.

00:40:56.590 --> 00:40:57.650
I'm done with this.

00:41:06.550 --> 00:41:08.110
If anyone reveals

00:41:08.110 --> 00:41:09.570
what was discussed today,

00:41:09.710 --> 00:41:11.480
I will exterminate their entire family.

00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:12.000
Yes.

00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:18.640
Lord Ling.

00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:20.400
[Ning'an Hall]

00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:21.840
Those things you just said

00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:23.580
were just to fool them, right?

00:41:23.630 --> 00:41:24.630
All that talk about terminal illness

00:41:24.630 --> 00:41:25.960
was just to frighten them.

00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:26.760
Isn't that so?

00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:35.350
Impossible.

00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:37.800
What illness can't you cure?

00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:40.030
You're the master of Zhengnian Villa,

00:41:40.030 --> 00:41:41.630
the best doctor in the world.

00:41:41.710 --> 00:41:42.670
Even if others can't cure him,

00:41:42.670 --> 00:41:44.150
you must have a way to save him.

00:41:44.150 --> 00:41:46.080
Unfortunately, I'm just a mortal,

00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:47.670
not a god.

00:41:54.070 --> 00:41:56.250
When was the illness discovered?

00:41:56.360 --> 00:41:57.420
Fifteen years ago.

00:41:58.110 --> 00:41:59.000
Fifteen?

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.090
He knew about his terminal illness

00:42:05.030 --> 00:42:07.350
fifteen years ago.

00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:08.560
That's right.

00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:09.760
One could say

00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:11.960
that every day for these fifteen years,

00:42:13.030 --> 00:42:14.070
your father has been living

00:42:14.070 --> 00:42:16.000
on the edge between life and death.

00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:18.130
Why didn't he tell me?

00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:19.990
You were still young then,

00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:21.400
and you resented him

00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:22.800
for your mother's death.

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:24.330
He chose not to tell you.

00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:26.480
He must have had his reasons.

00:42:28.110 --> 00:42:29.510
I deliberately let Zhuang Shen and others
know

00:42:29.510 --> 00:42:30.630
for your own good.

00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:31.840
Otherwise they would definitely

00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:33.000
blame all of your father's illness

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:34.150
on you.

00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:35.590
Your situation will be

00:42:35.590 --> 00:42:36.520
even worse then.

00:42:36.710 --> 00:42:37.790
What can I do?

00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:39.930
Is there any way to cure him?

00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:41.550
I don't even know

00:42:41.550 --> 00:42:42.630
what I should do.

00:42:44.630 --> 00:42:46.030
All these years, I've traveled everywhere

00:42:46.030 --> 00:42:47.920
trying to find a way to save your father.

00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:48.590
That's because

00:42:48.590 --> 00:42:49.630
I promised your mother

00:42:49.630 --> 00:42:50.800
to save him.

00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:53.740
It has nothing to do with Feng Pingcheng.

00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:56.140
Even though your mother has passed away,

00:42:56.920 --> 00:42:58.250
I would still do my best.

00:42:58.510 --> 00:42:59.880
But human ability has its limits,

00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:01.280
and fate has its course.

00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:04.410
I can only barely extend his life.

00:43:05.030 --> 00:43:06.960
I cannot find a way to save him.

00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:09.590
What about the place that saved Ning Fei?

00:43:09.590 --> 00:43:11.630
Does that place have a way to cure him?

00:43:11.630 --> 00:43:12.440
That place

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:13.800
is the Storm Alliance

00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:15.130
founded by your mother.

00:43:16.110 --> 00:43:17.130
Mother?

00:43:17.190 --> 00:43:17.960
The people of the Storm Alliance

00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:19.000
hate Feng Pingcheng deeply

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:20.590
because of your mother's death.

00:43:20.590 --> 00:43:22.230
Would they be willing to save him?

00:43:22.230 --> 00:43:23.550
Besides, your father is suffering from

00:43:23.550 --> 00:43:24.810
qi depletion illness.

00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:26.800
Even if they were willing to help,

00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:28.130
they couldn't save him.

00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:29.190
Lord Ling.

00:43:30.150 --> 00:43:32.160
I just learned this truth today.

00:43:32.590 --> 00:43:33.640
But I beg you.

00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:35.380
His Majesty needs you now.

00:43:36.510 --> 00:43:38.310
Please also fulfill the promise

00:43:38.510 --> 00:43:40.320
you made to Mother.

00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:42.710
As for those who doubt you,

00:43:42.710 --> 00:43:43.640
leave them to me.

00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:45.460
Please feel free to treat him.

00:43:45.670 --> 00:43:47.510
Consider this a personal plea from me.
