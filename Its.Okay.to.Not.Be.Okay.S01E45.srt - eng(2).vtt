WEBVTT

00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:03.670
You meant for me to go see Mia, huh?

00:00:03.753 --> 00:00:05.130
So we could reconcile?!

00:00:05.588 --> 00:00:07.799
You son of a--

00:00:07.882 --> 00:00:09.300
Pokemon. She meant to say Pokemon.

00:00:09.384 --> 00:00:10.510
Gemma-- Ahh!

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:15.640
Hey, are you okay?

00:00:15.724 --> 00:00:17.100
Do you also feel sick?

00:00:17.183 --> 00:00:18.977
I'm fine. I guess I'm just tired.

00:00:20.103 --> 00:00:21.146
Make it fast.

00:00:21.229 --> 00:00:24.733
Happy birthday to my most
favorite writer in the whole world!

00:00:24.816 --> 00:00:26.067
Hello--

00:00:26.151 --> 00:00:27.902
Every year!

00:01:52.821 --> 00:01:54.948
Your music's too loud.

00:03:12.233 --> 00:03:13.318
It was you?

00:03:14.944 --> 00:03:16.070
You were the one singing?

00:03:16.738 --> 00:03:17.739
You heard me?

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:20.241
Why?

00:03:21.743 --> 00:03:23.620
Are you going to kill me again?

00:03:25.955 --> 00:03:27.248
But you're already dead.

00:03:28.124 --> 00:03:29.500
You should be dead.

00:03:31.753 --> 00:03:34.297
You should be dead! Die! Die!

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.758
Die! Die already!

00:03:37.967 --> 00:03:39.719
Let go of me!

00:03:39.802 --> 00:03:43.723
This is Tessie, our new house help.

00:03:43.806 --> 00:03:46.476
- Die!
- Let go of me!

00:03:46.935 --> 00:03:49.229
Mia, dear.

00:03:49.312 --> 00:03:50.730
Go inside.

00:03:50.813 --> 00:03:52.106
Samuel, please!

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.692
You should die! Die!

00:03:54.776 --> 00:03:56.444
- Die already!
- Mister Samuel!

00:03:56.527 --> 00:03:59.989
- Mister Samuel, stop it!
- Die! Die!

00:04:00.073 --> 00:04:01.282
No!

00:04:01.366 --> 00:04:03.785
- Mister Samuel!
- She was singing that song!

00:04:03.868 --> 00:04:05.745
- Mister Samuel, that's enough!
- Die!

00:04:05.828 --> 00:04:07.914
She should die! Both of them!

00:04:07.997 --> 00:04:09.832
- That's enough!
- She and Mia!

00:04:09.916 --> 00:04:11.668
They're both monsters!

00:04:11.751 --> 00:04:14.254
Your daughter's not a monster.
Mia's not a monster.

00:04:15.755 --> 00:04:17.799
You have to kill her.

00:04:17.882 --> 00:04:19.968
Or else, she'll kill you!

00:04:20.051 --> 00:04:24.097
She'll kill you! She'll kill you!

00:04:24.597 --> 00:04:28.434
She'll kill you! She'll kill you!

00:04:28.518 --> 00:04:30.144
You need to kill her!

00:04:30.228 --> 00:04:32.021
- She'll kill you!
- Samuel! Stop it!

00:04:32.105 --> 00:04:33.773
She'll kill you! She'll kill you!

00:04:33.856 --> 00:04:36.901
- Samuel! That's enough!
- She'll kill you!

00:04:36.985 --> 00:04:39.362
- She'll kill you!
- Patrick.

00:04:39.445 --> 00:04:42.573
- Let's get him inside.
- She'll kill you!

00:04:42.657 --> 00:04:45.326
She'll kill you.

00:04:51.874 --> 00:04:54.085
Take a deep breath.

00:05:07.098 --> 00:05:10.310
{\an8}Nurse, I'll just visit
a patient in the consultation room.

00:05:10.393 --> 00:05:12.687
{\an8}Then I'll update Doc Anok about it.

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.272
{\an8}- Thank you.
Okay.

00:05:17.984 --> 00:05:20.695
{\an8}Patty, closely monitor Samuel.

00:05:20.778 --> 00:05:22.488
{\an8}I'll go check on Zelda.

00:05:23.114 --> 00:05:24.115
{\an8}Yes, ma'am.

00:05:27.452 --> 00:05:32.040
{\an8}Didn't you say Samuel would
be better under your care, Olivia?

00:05:33.333 --> 00:05:35.001
{\an8}I have no time for this, Eden.

00:05:35.084 --> 00:05:36.586
{\an8}

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:40.006
{\an8}Of course.
You don't even have time for Zelda.

00:05:41.215 --> 00:05:43.885
{\an8}I don't need
to explain anything to you.

00:05:44.552 --> 00:05:46.179
{\an8}Eden, please.

00:05:46.262 --> 00:05:47.472
{\an8}No.

00:05:47.555 --> 00:05:49.098
{\an8}Even though it was a violent reaction,

00:05:49.182 --> 00:05:51.559
{\an8}Samuel choking Mia is more understandable

00:05:51.642 --> 00:05:53.352
{\an8}because of their relationship.

00:05:53.895 --> 00:05:55.730
{\an8}But doing that to another patient?

00:05:55.813 --> 00:05:58.566
{\an8}Clearly there is something wrong
happening under your care.

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:02.570
{\an8}And I know this isn't just
about being nurse-manager.

00:06:03.071 --> 00:06:05.615
{\an8}What do you really need from him, Olivia?

00:06:05.948 --> 00:06:07.075
{\an8}Tell me the truth.

00:06:08.701 --> 00:06:11.746
{\an8}I don't owe you any explanation.

00:06:11.829 --> 00:06:14.624
{\an8}I just need to focus on my work.

00:06:14.707 --> 00:06:16.334
{\an8}So, if you'll excuse me.

00:06:16.417 --> 00:06:23.758
{\an8}

00:06:25.551 --> 00:06:27.386
{\an8}The CCTV footage clearly showed

00:06:28.554 --> 00:06:30.556
{\an8}that Samuel was
the one who approached Zelda.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.350
{\an8}

00:06:32.433 --> 00:06:34.727
{\an8}He told me Zelda was singing.

00:06:35.144 --> 00:06:36.354
{\an8}What song?

00:06:36.437 --> 00:06:38.272
{\an8}He didn't say earlier.

00:06:38.815 --> 00:06:43.444
{\an8}But he mentioned last
time that it was a lullaby.

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:50.451
{\an8}

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:58.459
You're so annoying!

00:06:59.127 --> 00:07:03.047
I didn't say anything.

00:07:03.131 --> 00:07:07.009
He just suddenly
approached me and choked me.

00:07:08.845 --> 00:07:13.724
Maybe you said something,
even not related, that triggered Samuel

00:07:13.808 --> 00:07:15.810
There was nothing like that, Nurse!

00:07:16.769 --> 00:07:19.355
Don't you believe me?

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:23.317
I just want to hear what you have to say.

00:07:27.113 --> 00:07:30.700
Whatever it is,
it might help Samuel's treatment.

00:07:33.286 --> 00:07:35.413
And what about me?

00:07:35.496 --> 00:07:37.457
I was the one who got choked!

00:07:38.833 --> 00:07:41.169
Doc Emman always checks on you, right?

00:07:41.252 --> 00:07:43.754
We take care of all of you.

00:07:44.839 --> 00:07:46.007
How annoying.

00:07:46.757 --> 00:07:50.553
He choked me and called me a monster!

00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:53.306
What if I kill him?!

00:07:54.182 --> 00:07:55.141
Zelda.

00:08:02.064 --> 00:08:04.358
I'm leaving. I'm leaving.

00:08:04.442 --> 00:08:05.693
I want to rest.

00:08:05.776 --> 00:08:07.195
Take me to my room!

00:08:17.288 --> 00:08:19.540
Monster?

00:08:19.624 --> 00:08:23.753
But Samuel calls his wife a monster.

00:08:26.088 --> 00:08:30.426
Do you think
Mister Samuel mistook Zelda as his wife?

00:08:31.802 --> 00:08:32.803
Maybe.

00:08:33.471 --> 00:08:35.973
Zelda might know things about Samuel.

00:08:37.517 --> 00:08:40.353
I don't know how she'd know, though.

00:08:45.149 --> 00:08:48.486
What if Zelda is Samuel's real wife?

00:08:48.945 --> 00:08:49.862
Huh?

00:08:49.946 --> 00:08:53.407
I mean, after seven years of searching

00:08:53.824 --> 00:08:55.326
they declared her dead.

00:08:55.785 --> 00:08:58.579
But if Ingrid wasn't missing after all?

00:08:59.789 --> 00:09:01.707
What if she's not dead?

00:09:03.292 --> 00:09:04.794
But that's just my guess.

00:09:05.503 --> 00:09:08.631
You know,
anything's possible in this world.

00:09:09.757 --> 00:09:12.260
But it's just a possibility, okay?

00:09:14.095 --> 00:09:16.180
You should leave now with your brother.

00:09:16.264 --> 00:09:17.306
Why?

00:09:18.015 --> 00:09:19.892
Because she's returning soon.

00:09:20.309 --> 00:09:22.728
Who? Who is coming back?

00:09:26.232 --> 00:09:27.608
Ma'am Ingrid.

00:09:51.507 --> 00:09:52.633
Goodness.

00:09:52.717 --> 00:09:56.178
Mia, what are you doing here?

00:09:56.262 --> 00:09:58.514
Does Vincent know that you're here?

00:09:59.515 --> 00:10:03.686
You said I could drop by
whenever I wanted food, right?

00:10:05.229 --> 00:10:07.565
Can I take you up on that now?

00:10:09.191 --> 00:10:10.776
Of course!

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:13.279
Come on, follow me. Let's head inside.

00:10:23.205 --> 00:10:25.207
Happy birthday!

00:10:26.292 --> 00:10:30.630
Only children want spaghetti
prepared like that on their birthday.

00:10:30.713 --> 00:10:33.257
So assume it is your birthday today.

00:10:34.925 --> 00:10:36.802
Enjoy your spaghetti, sweetie.

00:10:39.096 --> 00:10:40.056
Oh!

00:10:40.139 --> 00:10:42.558
Maybe I could make you a dessert.

00:10:42.642 --> 00:10:44.810
I'll serve you my fruit salad.

00:10:45.436 --> 00:10:47.021
I'll be back.

00:11:21.806 --> 00:11:24.433
One, two, three…

00:11:24.517 --> 00:11:28.979
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

00:11:29.063 --> 00:11:33.150

Happy birthday, Miss Mia!

00:11:47.123 --> 00:11:50.626
I called Vincent while
I was busy in the kitchen.

00:11:50.709 --> 00:11:52.962
See these plates of
barbecue and fried chicken?

00:11:53.045 --> 00:11:55.798
I had him place an order so
we'd have plenty of food tonight.

00:12:01.011 --> 00:12:04.765
Miss Mia, that chocolate
cake really is the best.

00:12:04.849 --> 00:12:06.434
It's the same color as--

00:12:06.517 --> 00:12:07.560
Chocolate!

00:12:07.643 --> 00:12:10.896
A chocolate cake with just
the right amount of sweetness.

00:12:14.817 --> 00:12:17.319
I'll take a slice to Matmat later.

00:12:17.403 --> 00:12:18.821
It's his favorite.

00:12:20.489 --> 00:12:21.866
Thank you.

00:12:23.826 --> 00:12:25.453
Don't mention it.

00:12:25.536 --> 00:12:29.165
Birthdays are special to us mothers.

00:12:29.248 --> 00:12:32.418
We were the first to celebrate

00:12:32.501 --> 00:12:34.336
our child's arrival into the world.

00:12:40.885 --> 00:12:42.761
Blow out your candle now, Miss Mia.

00:12:42.845 --> 00:12:44.763
Then we can start eating.

00:12:44.847 --> 00:12:46.307
There we go.

00:12:57.443 --> 00:12:59.403
- Happy birthday!
- Happy birthday!

00:12:59.487 --> 00:13:01.655
Happy birthday, Miss Mia!

00:13:01.739 --> 00:13:03.407
- Go on.
- Let's do this!

00:13:03.491 --> 00:13:05.576
- Dig in.
- I've been waiting for this!

00:13:05.659 --> 00:13:07.953
- Let's eat.
- Excuse me.

00:13:08.037 --> 00:13:10.664
- I'll use my hands, Ma'am Li.
- Sure thing.

00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:12.583
Do you want anything else?

00:13:12.666 --> 00:13:14.001
- Use your plate.
- [Thank you.

00:13:14.084 --> 00:13:17.546
- I'll take that barbecue.
- Go ahead.

00:13:21.592 --> 00:13:22.593
Oops!

00:13:23.469 --> 00:13:25.429
For my favorite writer.

00:13:27.097 --> 00:13:30.893
It begins to lose
its value every time you say it.

00:13:42.112 --> 00:13:43.822
What can I say?

00:13:46.492 --> 00:13:48.077
You have excellent taste.

00:13:51.121 --> 00:13:53.916
You know, Mia, after all
these years of working with you,

00:13:54.542 --> 00:13:56.210
I can say I know you well.

00:13:57.336 --> 00:13:58.963
And I know that even now,

00:13:59.046 --> 00:14:01.423
you're still affected by what
happened with those siblings.

00:14:03.008 --> 00:14:04.176
But wake up, Mia.

00:14:04.802 --> 00:14:07.304
When will this obsession end?

00:14:08.305 --> 00:14:09.932
Aren't you tired of all this?

00:14:12.601 --> 00:14:13.686
Why?

00:14:15.229 --> 00:14:16.981
So I can go back to Manila?

00:14:17.815 --> 00:14:20.317
So I can get you out of Maravida.

00:14:21.610 --> 00:14:24.488
So your past,
and your parents, stops weighing on you.

00:14:26.782 --> 00:14:28.117
Seriously.

00:14:30.494 --> 00:14:32.413
Mia, I'm worried about you.

00:14:36.083 --> 00:14:38.836
That's the first time I enjoyed Montanesa.

00:14:56.312 --> 00:14:57.688
But he said…

00:14:59.315 --> 00:15:00.900
it was all just a dream.

00:15:04.987 --> 00:15:07.197
It's not that I agree with Patrick,

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:09.867
but he's right.

00:15:12.119 --> 00:15:15.706
You had a memorable
experience because it was temporary.

00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:18.500
You said it yourself, Mia.

00:15:19.126 --> 00:15:22.838
If the same thing keeps happening,
if you experience it every day,

00:15:22.922 --> 00:15:24.465
it begins to lose its value.

00:15:28.928 --> 00:15:30.095
Look at you.

00:15:31.722 --> 00:15:34.099
Speaking words of wisdom.

00:15:36.602 --> 00:15:38.604
Don't tell me you're
thinking of becoming a writer.

00:15:40.189 --> 00:15:41.565
We already talked about this.

00:15:42.191 --> 00:15:43.567
You're my favorite writer--

00:15:43.651 --> 00:15:45.778
No, it's like you want my job.

00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:51.075
Fine.

00:15:52.785 --> 00:15:54.453
I'll write the book.

00:15:55.621 --> 00:15:56.622
Yes!

00:15:57.289 --> 00:15:58.332
Now?

00:15:59.917 --> 00:16:01.669
Whoa, whoa. Where are you going?

00:16:01.752 --> 00:16:03.045
Wait, you're going
in the wrong direction--

00:16:03.128 --> 00:16:04.463
It's my birthday.

00:16:05.381 --> 00:16:06.382
Stay here.

00:16:09.927 --> 00:16:11.720
Classic Mia.

00:16:19.645 --> 00:16:21.021
Matmat?

00:16:22.898 --> 00:16:24.483
Matmat?

00:16:25.317 --> 00:16:27.277
My bestie?

00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:30.739
N-No…

00:16:30.823 --> 00:16:34.618
Matmat
doesn't want to see Mia.

00:16:34.702 --> 00:16:36.412
- Bestie?
- No…

00:16:36.495 --> 00:16:38.205
I don't like Mia.

00:16:38.288 --> 00:16:39.999
Matmat?

00:16:40.791 --> 00:16:42.710
Come on, open the door.

00:16:43.585 --> 00:16:46.088
Let's talk about our book.

00:16:47.715 --> 00:16:48.716
No!

00:16:49.341 --> 00:16:52.136
- I-I don't want to!
- I know you're there, Matmat.

00:16:53.721 --> 00:16:55.472
Come on now.

00:16:56.807 --> 00:16:59.935
If you're not going to do it,
I'll force it open.

00:17:00.019 --> 00:17:01.437
I've got an electric chainsaw.

00:17:03.105 --> 00:17:05.232
I don't believe you!

00:17:07.401 --> 00:17:09.028
Matmat, I'm serious.

00:17:10.112 --> 00:17:12.531
I'm getting that chainsaw.
I'll be right back.

00:17:21.415 --> 00:17:22.833
S-She's gone.

00:17:25.711 --> 00:17:27.004
She left me alone.

00:17:31.842 --> 00:17:33.135
I'm serious!

00:17:34.428 --> 00:17:35.929
- I'm here!
- No…

00:17:36.013 --> 00:17:36.889
Don't!

00:17:36.972 --> 00:17:39.641
Please, no! D-Don't do it…

00:17:39.725 --> 00:17:40.726
Fine.

00:17:41.518 --> 00:17:44.271
One, two…

00:17:44.813 --> 00:17:46.356
- Three!
- No!

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:47.983
Mama Li will get mad.

00:17:53.197 --> 00:17:54.907
I don't see any chainsaw.

00:18:01.622 --> 00:18:03.624
I don't want to be
with that doll anymore.

00:18:03.707 --> 00:18:05.417
Can it be you instead?

00:18:06.502 --> 00:18:08.420
I'd rather be with you.

00:18:10.798 --> 00:18:11.799
Liar.

00:18:11.882 --> 00:18:14.635
No, I'm telling the truth!
The house feels empty.

00:18:14.718 --> 00:18:17.387
It's just boring
without my bestie around.

00:18:17.471 --> 00:18:19.098
You're my bestie, right?

00:18:19.932 --> 00:18:21.475
- Matmat?
- Liar!

00:18:21.558 --> 00:18:23.393
Matmat, I'm not lying.

00:18:26.021 --> 00:18:27.272
You're a liar.

00:18:27.356 --> 00:18:29.441
- You're a liar!
- Matmat, listen to--

00:18:29.525 --> 00:18:31.527
No, I don't want to! You're a liar!

00:18:32.569 --> 00:18:33.612
Matmat!

00:18:34.613 --> 00:18:35.989
Matmat--

00:18:36.323 --> 00:18:37.449
Matmat--

00:18:41.286 --> 00:18:43.831
Matmat!

00:18:45.290 --> 00:18:48.460
- They're always lying to me.
- Matmat!

00:18:48.544 --> 00:18:49.837
They say--

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:52.089
They say I'm their best friend,

00:18:52.172 --> 00:18:53.966
but they keep secrets from me.

00:18:54.049 --> 00:18:56.844
They kept the trip
with Patpat secret from me.

00:18:56.927 --> 00:18:58.137
Matmat!

00:18:59.346 --> 00:19:00.514
Liar!

00:19:00.597 --> 00:19:03.225
Liars are mean people!

00:19:13.235 --> 00:19:15.070
I'm done with camping cars.

00:19:16.613 --> 00:19:19.074
- Matmat--
- No more camping vans!

00:19:19.158 --> 00:19:21.285
I don't like Mia anymore!

00:19:28.584 --> 00:19:32.004
They call me bestie, but…

00:19:32.546 --> 00:19:35.716
but they kept that trip
with Patpat a secret from me.

00:19:49.104 --> 00:19:50.230
Matmat.

00:19:51.315 --> 00:19:53.775
Do you know who the real mean ones are?

00:19:54.401 --> 00:19:57.863
People who don't believe others.

00:19:59.823 --> 00:20:02.284
I guess you're
familiar with the story of…

00:20:03.202 --> 00:20:05.245
"The Boy Who Cried Wolf"

00:20:08.207 --> 00:20:09.958
There was a boy who kept crying

00:20:10.042 --> 00:20:12.419
that a wolf was attacking all the sheep.

00:20:14.713 --> 00:20:17.382
But when the neighbors rushed to help,

00:20:18.008 --> 00:20:19.801
there was no wolf to be found.

00:20:28.018 --> 00:20:29.519
Take your medicine.

00:20:48.121 --> 00:20:49.748
Why don't you get some rest?

00:20:52.626 --> 00:20:55.295
I'm okay, I promise.

00:21:22.739 --> 00:21:23.699
{\an8}"FINE. FORGET ABOUT THE BIRTHDAY"

00:21:23.782 --> 00:21:25.117
{\an8}"BRING ME MEDICINE AND SOUP. I'M SICK."

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:27.244
{\an8}"IT'S MY BIRTHDAY TODAY.
WHERE'S MY GREETING?"

00:21:27.327 --> 00:21:30.038
He kept calling out to them.

00:21:32.499 --> 00:21:35.419
Making up one lie after another.

00:21:37.921 --> 00:21:40.632
I-I don't like that boy.

00:21:40.716 --> 00:21:42.134
He's a liar.

00:21:43.802 --> 00:21:47.306
Did you know why he kept doing it?

00:21:49.474 --> 00:21:50.767
Because,

00:21:51.518 --> 00:21:52.811
it was fun?

00:21:53.895 --> 00:21:55.230
He was bored?

00:21:58.942 --> 00:22:00.027
No.

00:22:01.486 --> 00:22:04.031
He kept repeating the same lies

00:22:04.114 --> 00:22:05.574
because he was sad.

00:22:06.908 --> 00:22:08.910
Because he didn't have any friends.

00:22:16.293 --> 00:22:19.087
He was a lonely boy.

00:22:27.012 --> 00:22:27.888
Pogi.

00:22:28.513 --> 00:22:29.598
Pogi, seriously, wake up!

00:22:29.681 --> 00:22:30.849
Pogi!

00:22:32.809 --> 00:22:33.977
Come on, Pogi!

00:22:34.061 --> 00:22:35.312
Pogi, open your eyes!

00:22:36.104 --> 00:22:37.230
Pogi!

00:22:37.314 --> 00:22:38.273
Pogi?

00:22:40.317 --> 00:22:42.402
- Patrick!
- What happened?

00:22:42.486 --> 00:22:44.946
I saw him like this,
and then I found this.

00:22:57.334 --> 00:23:00.003
Do not leave Mia alone.
It's her birthday tomorrow.

00:23:00.087 --> 00:23:01.088
I don't like Mia anymore!

00:23:01.171 --> 00:23:02.255
They're monsters!

00:23:02.339 --> 00:23:03.548
Your daughter's not a monster.

00:23:03.632 --> 00:23:06.093
He was sad because
he didn't have any friends.

00:23:06.176 --> 00:23:10.055
You always make me feel like
I come second, Matmat is your priority.

00:23:10.138 --> 00:23:12.516
I'm scared that if I give even a little,

00:23:12.599 --> 00:23:13.767
I'll lose everything.

00:23:13.850 --> 00:23:15.685
I don't want to lose everything.

00:23:15.769 --> 00:23:18.438
Why does it seem so easy
for you to just forget everything?

00:23:18.522 --> 00:23:21.566
Whenever you feel
yourself losing control, count to three.

00:23:21.650 --> 00:23:24.444
One, two, three.

00:23:24.528 --> 00:23:28.115
You'll pay for everything you did to me!

00:23:28.198 --> 00:23:31.326
On the day of your birthday,
he has a surprise for you.

00:23:31.409 --> 00:23:32.410
Your death.

00:23:32.494 --> 00:23:34.246
The hell I care.

00:23:34.329 --> 00:23:35.455
Are you with Mia?

00:23:35.539 --> 00:23:37.082
No, she left a while ago.

00:23:38.625 --> 00:23:43.338
If at least one person believed in him,

00:23:43.421 --> 00:23:45.006
he wouldn't have died.
