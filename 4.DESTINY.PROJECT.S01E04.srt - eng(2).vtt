00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:33.690
Why don't you cook for me?

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:36.580
Even though I've come to see you many times.

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.830
You never welcome me like...

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.000
you welcome him.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.040
Someone like you

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.060
doesn't need to eat food,

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:54.270
you'd rather eat my feet!

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.030
Shhh.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.760
We have been together for...

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.220
66 years.

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.150
You just give me your feet?

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:14.670
I'd rather eat you whole.

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:20.670
Take good care of your people.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:04.390
Hey!

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:30.750
It's tomorrow...

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:35.580
Hey!

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.350
Hey, what's going on!?

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:46.630
Can you hear me?

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:49.850
Hey, please open the door!

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:52.470
Hey!

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:41.370
Thanu.

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:42.980
Thanu, can you hear me?

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:43.970
Thanu!

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:45.120
Wake up!

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:46.070
Thanu!

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:47.980
Damn. Wake up, Thanu!

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:52.110
Thanu!

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:53.200
Wake up!

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:55.550
Thanu.

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:57.510
Can you hear me?

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.120
Wake up, Thanu!

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:03.260
Thanu!

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:23.630
Lie down properly.

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:55.230
You are safe now.

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:56.660
Thanu.

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:09.390
Who did this to you?

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:39.400
Thanu!

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:17.050
I don't know what happened to me.

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:19.460
But if I survive,

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:24.180
I'll find a way to get your body out of here!

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:26.520
I promise!

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:17.270
Where are you?

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:18.650
Come out!

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:27.710
What do you want?

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:31.510
I told you

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:33.410
to take good care of him.

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:36.750
I won't even let you

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:39.020
touch his hand.

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:41.030
Let me ask you,

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:43.570
what do you want?

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:47.940
Your life is mine!

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:49.330
Remember this!

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:53.220
Why do you have to hurt my friend?

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:54.980
Friend?

00:07:57.740 --> 00:07:59.130
Take it easy.

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:02.730
Are you sure he is your friend?

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:11.030
Even though his appearance is similar to your friend named...

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:17.930
What's his name again?

00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:22.990
Oh.

00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:25.250
Thanu.

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:28.660
But don't forget

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:31.200
how many lifetimes have passed.

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:34.450
Hasn't he been reborn twice already?

00:08:39.810 --> 00:08:41.540
He became a stranger.

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:46.270
He doesn't know you anymore.

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:49.680
He doesn't know Chai Khun anymore.

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:55.040
But you have no right to kill anyone like this!

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:56.750
You have no right to stop me either!

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:00.360
Don't forget

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.590
you owe me.

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:06.870
Don't you remember

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:09.470
who made you immortal?

00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:17.410
But if you forget,

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:20.710
I'll remind you.

00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:30.140
Are you sure?

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:36.820
Your wish will come true.

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:40.220
You will survive

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:41.950
forever.

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:54.230
So funny, right?

00:10:58.010 --> 00:10:59.770
You dodged prison more times than I can count,

00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:04.290
but now you're stuck with me forever.

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:10.870
Don't even think about escaping from here.

00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:19.250
Tonight's just a warning,

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:22.620
Tomorrow, I finish this.

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:50.030
Don't you remember

00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:52.450
who made you immortal?

00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:11.710
No!

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:12.630
Don't do this to me!

00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:14.630
Let me go!

00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:15.910
Don't!

00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:17.440
Don't!

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:21.760
Don't go.

00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:36.340
What happened

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:39.240
just now?

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:52.460
Nothing.

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:55.310
You're just dreaming.

00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:12.940
I'm scared.

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:16.840
Hey.

00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:23.460
You're feverish.

00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:25.580
Are you okay?

00:13:44.510 --> 00:13:45.600
Just take a rest.

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:31.820
Are you feeling better yet?

00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:37.010
Yes.

00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:38.700
Thank you so much.

00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:47.470
But...

00:14:49.570 --> 00:14:50.920
The dream just now

00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:54.110
was so realistic.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.100
You woke up so early.

00:15:55.050 --> 00:15:57.310
I have to prepare breakfast for a special guest.

00:15:59.450 --> 00:16:00.340
Who?

00:16:01.450 --> 00:16:02.510
The guest in the room next door.

00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:06.700
Okay.

00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:09.300
Aero~

00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:17.300
Have breakfast first.

00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:28.070
Does it look delicious?

00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:29.810
It looks so delicious.

00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:34.660
Can I have some coffee too?

00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:36.050
Sure.

00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:38.410
I'll make you some coffee.

00:17:16.610 --> 00:17:17.160
Hey.

00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:19.660
Hey!

00:17:26.530 --> 00:17:27.260
Hey.

00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:28.870
Hey!

00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:35.620
Hey, hold on!

00:17:36.290 --> 00:17:37.020
Hey!

00:17:59.250 --> 00:17:59.920
Hey.

00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:01.200
Calm down.

00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:03.820
Why did you take it?

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:05.660
Didn't I tell you

00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:07.870
not to take it without permission?

00:18:10.030 --> 00:18:10.920
I'm sorry.

00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:14.970
I just wonder what information is written about the blood moon.

00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:18.050
Did you know? I'm drawing about...

00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:34.230
Does he have to be this upset with me?

00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:36.490
Even though everything was fine last night.

00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:54.970
Hey.

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:57.130
I'm sorry

00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:00.140
for taking your book without permission.

00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:10.140
Hey.

00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:22.310
I'm sorry.

00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:26.520
Can you forgive me?

00:19:29.050 --> 00:19:30.410
Can you hear me?

00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:32.980
I'm sorry.

00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:41.770
Hey.

00:19:44.010 --> 00:19:45.720
We were still

00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:49.120
good last night.

00:19:49.930 --> 00:19:51.530
What happened to you today?

00:19:57.560 --> 00:19:58.350
Fine.

00:19:59.370 --> 00:20:00.370
I have a headache.

00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:02.170
Please give me some medicine.

00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:10.930
Hey, you!

00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:12.640
Didn't you hear what I said?

00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:18.350
Take your medicine and go to your room quickly.

00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:20.850
I'll bring you dinner later.

00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:23.410
Let me remind you again.

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:26.270
Never leave your room after sunset.

00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:28.410
I forbid you from going anywhere after sunset.

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:30.880
How can you even say that!?

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:34.050
I came here because I wanted to see the blood moon clearly.

00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:35.870
I want to see it with my own eyes.

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:36.930
Hey!

00:20:37.210 --> 00:20:38.150
Wait!

00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:39.300
Hey!

00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:20.710
Why can't I leave my room at night?

00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:27.210
What on earth is really going on here?

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:41.690
Hey!

00:22:41.691 --> 00:22:43.310
[It's me]

00:22:56.990 --> 00:22:57.760
Hey, you.

00:22:58.830 --> 00:23:00.170
Let me ask you something.

00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:04.130
Did you do anything to my stuff?

00:23:04.670 --> 00:23:05.580
What do you mean?

00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:08.020
Here.

00:23:08.510 --> 00:23:09.370
Who wrote it?

00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:16.970
Not me.

00:23:17.890 --> 00:23:18.490
Huh?

00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:21.050
If not you, then who?

00:23:21.210 --> 00:23:21.990
I don't know.

00:23:23.030 --> 00:23:25.250
You're serious about the Blood Moon, never change.

00:23:26.210 --> 00:23:27.330
Both the drawing

00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:30.030
and the notebook you stole from me yesterday.

00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:32.180
What do you mean?

00:23:33.010 --> 00:23:34.020
I am serious and never change?

00:23:35.250 --> 00:23:36.460
Have we known each other before?

00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:48.570
If there's nothing else,

00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:50.450
you can leave now.

00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:56.190
Oh.

00:23:58.330 --> 00:23:59.840
It will be dark in a few hours.

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:02.450
Don't leave your room tonight, no matter what.

00:24:05.670 --> 00:24:06.750
Hold on.

00:24:20.130 --> 00:24:21.650
No matter what you hear,

00:24:22.210 --> 00:24:24.040
do not leave the room.

00:24:24.770 --> 00:24:25.980
If you do not want to encounter danger,

00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:27.930
then do as I say.

00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:31.730
What is the reason?

00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:34.370
What you will encounter tonight

00:24:35.290 --> 00:24:36.610
is beyond description.

00:24:37.770 --> 00:24:40.110
Because I've been stuck in the past here for a long time.

00:24:41.730 --> 00:24:43.450
I just pray that it will finally end

00:24:44.330 --> 00:24:45.600
and be over.

00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:41.100
It's here!

00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:42.280
You came faster than I thought.

00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:43.930
Do you miss me?

00:26:47.370 --> 00:26:48.790
But tonight,

00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:50.580
I didn't come to see you.

00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:55.310
Now then,

00:26:56.190 --> 00:26:58.380
where's my little prey?

00:27:00.430 --> 00:27:03.800
Let's see who will survive and who will die tonight,

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:05.250
you or me.

00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:06.920
You will know soon.

00:28:25.890 --> 00:28:29.170
I, Thanu Ajitsara,

00:28:29.710 --> 00:28:31.490
hereby offer my life to you

00:28:32.330 --> 00:28:33.670
in exchange for a promise

00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:35.790
to save my life.

00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:39.570
Are you ready to go with me?

00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:42.620
Hey!

00:28:51.690 --> 00:28:52.520
Who are you?

00:32:13.510 --> 00:32:14.100
Hey!

00:32:28.410 --> 00:32:28.850
Go away.

00:32:29.010 --> 00:32:30.430
Get out of here as fast as you can.

00:32:30.490 --> 00:32:31.040
Run!

00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:33.250
Chai Khun!

00:33:03.670 --> 00:33:09.450
♬ It's not easy to explain every story ♬

00:33:11.930 --> 00:33:19.520
♬ Describing the five rivers to the stars ♬

00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:27.410
♬ No party lasts forever ♬

00:33:29.370 --> 00:33:35.560
♬ Time has slipped away, leading us to a dead end ♬

00:33:36.070 --> 00:33:44.679
♬ I wish the end would never come ♬

00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:52.770
♬ Sorry, the ending is not like in the fairy tale ♬

00:33:53.490 --> 00:33:55.290
Tonight will be longer than any night before.

00:34:17.450 --> 00:34:18.660
Welcome

00:34:19.810 --> 00:34:21.130
to the Blood Moon Night.
