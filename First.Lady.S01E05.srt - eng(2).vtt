ALL NAMES, CHARACTERS,
AND EVENTS ARE FICTIONAL

00:00:43.001 --> 00:00:44.961
CHILD AND ANIMAL WELFARE
REGULATIONS WERE OBSERVED

00:00:48.631 --> 00:00:50.133
It's what I'm good at.

00:00:51.634 --> 00:00:52.969
It's

00:00:53.052 --> 00:00:54.763
ruining something.

00:00:57.849 --> 00:00:59.059
This time,

00:01:00.101 --> 00:01:01.519
it will be you.

00:01:20.622 --> 00:01:22.165
Nonsense.

00:01:25.335 --> 00:01:27.253
It's total nonsense.

00:01:28.421 --> 00:01:30.298
WINTER OF 2008

00:01:30.381 --> 00:01:33.676
If I change first, I can change the world?

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.554
The truth is,
the world blames me for changing alone.

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:41.267
The very world that
they've been blaming for not changing.

00:01:46.856 --> 00:01:50.860
Do you know
why my father crushed you completely?

00:01:52.654 --> 00:01:54.697
Because you were sincere.

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.408
The real deal.

00:02:08.294 --> 00:02:10.421
He was afraid that people would see that.

00:02:10.964 --> 00:02:12.006
That's why.

00:02:13.633 --> 00:02:16.636
The activists who wander
from protest to protest

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:20.014
and politicians who prowl
around the election scene don't have that.

00:02:21.808 --> 00:02:24.018
You actually came from the working class,

00:02:24.102 --> 00:02:27.063
and you were fighting for your colleagues
who were wrongfully injured.

00:02:28.314 --> 00:02:30.900
It was only a matter of time
before people realized

00:02:30.984 --> 00:02:32.443
that you were the real deal.

00:02:34.112 --> 00:02:36.698
Like you said, it's been 20 years.

00:02:36.781 --> 00:02:39.993
Do you know
why Haseong still supports my father?

00:02:40.076 --> 00:02:42.328
Even if it was only a towel,

00:02:43.246 --> 00:02:45.957
he'd visit those
living beyond the reach of cars,

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.252
offering them one by one
and asking how they are doing.

00:02:49.335 --> 00:02:52.505
That sincerity touches people's hearts
and makes him win.

00:02:53.923 --> 00:02:57.886
You may buy votes with your slogan,
but not their hearts.

00:02:59.387 --> 00:03:00.763
To win their hearts,

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:02.891
you have to be sincere.

00:03:06.436 --> 00:03:07.896
And you

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:10.773
already have the sincerity.

00:03:11.858 --> 00:03:14.235
Only you don't know

00:03:15.278 --> 00:03:18.907
how powerful it is.

00:03:24.913 --> 00:03:26.664
Gosh, it's freezing.

00:03:26.748 --> 00:03:28.124
Oh, you were here.

00:03:30.168 --> 00:03:31.419
Why are you two together?

00:03:53.858 --> 00:03:56.569
If you were going to drink,
you should've called me.

00:03:56.653 --> 00:03:59.322
You know I crave alcohol
after I work overtime…

00:06:24.634 --> 00:06:26.677
H CHEMICAL'S ILLEGAL SUCCESSION OUT

00:06:28.137 --> 00:06:29.472

DANGER
KEEP OUT

00:08:00.396 --> 00:08:02.023
Wow.

00:08:02.106 --> 00:08:03.608
Where did you get these?

00:08:03.691 --> 00:08:04.984
From the sauna locker room?

00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:08.779
What? Is it a trade secret?

00:08:13.534 --> 00:08:16.829
All right. One, two, three…

00:08:16.913 --> 00:08:18.289
Here. 30,000 won.

00:08:24.253 --> 00:08:25.755
Are you done being a fangirl now?

00:08:26.589 --> 00:08:27.882
Good thinking.

00:08:27.965 --> 00:08:31.511
My life's so messed up,
everyone around me is Cha Su-yeon's fan.

00:08:31.594 --> 00:08:33.596
And they're all living miserable lives.

00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:36.807
Enough with the nonsense
and give me 20,000 won more.

00:08:37.391 --> 00:08:38.643
So you're not mute.

00:08:39.352 --> 00:08:41.312
Here. 50,000 won.

00:08:55.159 --> 00:08:56.869
It's a full set. You're good.

00:09:01.666 --> 00:09:03.125
MR. BUYER

00:09:05.628 --> 00:09:06.879
Hello, sir.

00:09:07.547 --> 00:09:08.548
Now?

00:09:08.631 --> 00:09:09.966
Sure, no problem.

00:09:10.049 --> 00:09:12.051
Just send me where you want to meet.

00:09:12.635 --> 00:09:14.512
I'll bring the stuff over right away.

00:09:36.867 --> 00:09:39.412
I didn't see the necklace that I gave you.

00:09:39.495 --> 00:09:41.414
Maybe Lee Hwa-jin stole it?

00:09:41.497 --> 00:09:44.375
She was ransacking this place
without turning the lights on.

00:10:04.395 --> 00:10:06.105
-Hello.
-Hello. Open it.

00:10:11.485 --> 00:10:12.486
Take it.

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:13.904
Thank you.

00:10:13.988 --> 00:10:15.031
There's one more.

00:10:42.016 --> 00:10:42.933
This way.

00:10:45.561 --> 00:10:47.104
-This way, please.
-Thanks.

00:10:47.188 --> 00:10:48.189
Wait.

00:10:48.272 --> 00:10:51.984
Could you tell me a little bit
about this person who wanted to see me?

00:10:52.568 --> 00:10:54.737
Did the chairman not mention anything?

00:10:55.571 --> 00:10:58.532
I was just told it's a woman in her 20s.

00:11:01.035 --> 00:11:02.161
Come this way.

00:11:02.244 --> 00:11:03.412
Okay.

00:11:22.765 --> 00:11:25.351
Hello, nice to meet you.
I'm Choi Myeong-ju.

00:11:27.019 --> 00:11:31.023
I heard you wanted some special outfits,
so I brought a few.

00:11:32.108 --> 00:11:35.486
You can try them on before you decide…

00:12:24.702 --> 00:12:26.287
Let's divorce.

00:13:11.081 --> 00:13:12.416
Keep your eyes closed.

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:13.417
Okay.

00:13:20.174 --> 00:13:21.425
One second.

00:13:21.509 --> 00:13:22.426
Okay.

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:23.969
Now, open your eyes.

00:13:24.053 --> 00:13:25.638
Ta-da.

00:13:27.598 --> 00:13:30.976
Congrats on your admission, Ji-yu.
You're going to high school now.

00:13:31.936 --> 00:13:33.145
Do you like it?

00:13:33.229 --> 00:13:34.104
Mom.

00:13:35.689 --> 00:13:37.107
Are you sure I can wear this?

00:13:37.191 --> 00:13:40.236
It's the only thing you wanted
from what I have.

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:43.113
Are you sure?

00:13:43.197 --> 00:13:44.365
Of course.

00:13:45.866 --> 00:13:47.576
But school starts in one month.

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:48.953
One month will fly by.

00:13:51.121 --> 00:13:53.165
Mom, but I--

00:13:53.249 --> 00:13:54.792
Why? Keep it on.

00:13:54.875 --> 00:13:56.835
So Dad can see it when he's home.

00:13:56.919 --> 00:13:59.004
I want this as a gift for graduation,

00:13:59.088 --> 00:14:00.297
not for starting school.

00:14:00.381 --> 00:14:01.549
What?

00:14:01.632 --> 00:14:03.842
I love this.

00:14:04.635 --> 00:14:06.637
I really love it,

00:14:07.388 --> 00:14:08.764
but I'll love it

00:14:09.473 --> 00:14:12.017
even more if I get it when I turn 20.

00:14:13.018 --> 00:14:14.103
When you turn 20?

00:14:14.687 --> 00:14:15.688
Yes.

00:14:17.398 --> 00:14:19.692
No, that's insane.

00:14:19.775 --> 00:14:21.277
You turning 20?

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:23.821
Come on. Three years will fly by.

00:14:23.904 --> 00:14:26.824
So please keep it safe until then.

00:14:31.537 --> 00:14:33.581
Maybe Lee Hwa-jin stole it?

00:14:33.664 --> 00:14:36.584
She was ransacking this place
without turning the lights on.

00:15:01.734 --> 00:15:04.236
Please enter the passcode.

00:15:08.866 --> 00:15:10.784
Safe unlocked.

00:15:10.868 --> 00:15:12.077
Safe door open.

00:15:34.934 --> 00:15:38.354
YU JIN-MYEONG
APRIL 4, 2012

00:15:53.661 --> 00:15:54.495
Ms. Cha.

00:15:54.578 --> 00:15:58.457
I went to Chairman Yang's vacation home
to see his special guest today.

00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:00.334
And guess who I met there.

00:16:00.417 --> 00:16:02.586
Hwa-jin. Lee Hwa-jin!

00:16:07.424 --> 00:16:10.052
HASEONG HIGH SCHOOL

00:16:10.135 --> 00:16:13.347
HASEONG HIGH SCHOOL RAISES TALENT
THROUGH A HEALTHY MIND AND BODY

00:16:17.893 --> 00:16:20.396
ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE RESULTS
OF THE SCHOOL VIOLENCE CASE

00:16:20.479 --> 00:16:23.315
Allegations that President-elect's wife,
Cha, exerted pressure

00:16:23.399 --> 00:16:26.485
to block the convening
of the school violence committee

00:16:26.568 --> 00:16:27.903
have been proven false.

00:16:27.987 --> 00:16:30.447
Stating that Ko and Park,
who filmed and shared the video,

00:16:30.531 --> 00:16:32.533
habitually committed acts of violence

00:16:32.616 --> 00:16:35.369
and used the footage to threaten them,

00:16:35.452 --> 00:16:38.831
their victims have filed
a criminal complaint.

00:16:39.707 --> 00:16:42.918
That's the question.
Doesn't this remind you of a formula?

00:16:43.002 --> 00:16:44.003
It's…

00:16:44.086 --> 00:16:45.879
Hi, Ji-yu.

00:16:45.963 --> 00:16:47.131
Go and sit.

00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:50.509
Let's continue. Focus.

00:16:50.592 --> 00:16:53.929
This question should remind you
of the formula.

00:16:54.013 --> 00:16:56.640
We talked about this
in the last class, guys.

00:16:56.724 --> 00:16:58.100
Focus.

00:16:58.183 --> 00:16:59.935
Focus, okay?

00:17:00.019 --> 00:17:01.353
This comes up a lot on exams.

00:17:01.437 --> 00:17:05.149
Now, plus three…

00:17:05.232 --> 00:17:08.444
What do you mean?
You don't want to go study abroad?

00:17:09.069 --> 00:17:10.696
I'm not going.

00:17:11.864 --> 00:17:13.282
I'm not going to run away.

00:17:14.241 --> 00:17:16.869
Ji-yu, this can be hard for you.

00:17:16.952 --> 00:17:18.245
I told you.

00:17:18.871 --> 00:17:21.373
Even if the same thing happens,
I'll fight her again.

00:17:23.083 --> 00:17:26.545
The fact that Dad's president now
changed your world,

00:17:26.628 --> 00:17:27.963
not mine.

00:17:29.256 --> 00:17:30.924
I want to stay in my world.

00:17:32.051 --> 00:17:33.510
I'll fight in my world.

00:17:34.386 --> 00:17:38.390
So don't use me as an excuse.
You just do what you want.

00:17:39.099 --> 00:17:41.060
If you want to divorce him, divorce him.

00:17:41.143 --> 00:17:42.728
If you want to fight, fight.

00:17:45.564 --> 00:17:47.983
Just apply the modified formula.

00:17:48.067 --> 00:17:50.819
Now, what is X plus Y?

00:17:50.903 --> 00:17:52.905
It's three.

00:17:52.988 --> 00:17:54.948
X plus Y equals three.

00:17:55.032 --> 00:17:57.284
And X multiplied by Y equals minus two.

00:17:57.367 --> 00:17:58.577
Minus two.

00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:00.287
Then X squared plus Y cubed…

00:18:00.370 --> 00:18:01.330
Explain this.

00:18:02.331 --> 00:18:03.665
You said I could count on you.

00:18:05.209 --> 00:18:06.168
Are you okay, sir?

00:18:07.544 --> 00:18:08.712
I'm sorry.

00:18:10.881 --> 00:18:13.175
I only asked you
to keep Ji-yu out of trouble

00:18:13.258 --> 00:18:15.427
in case Su-yeon tried to pull strings.

00:18:15.511 --> 00:18:18.097
So I was going to handle it quietly.

00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:22.226
Then she flipped out, saying I was
threatening her. What could I do?

00:18:23.393 --> 00:18:25.896
Saying Ji-yu can't study abroad
unless she divorces me

00:18:25.979 --> 00:18:27.147
is definitely a threat.

00:18:28.315 --> 00:18:30.109
I thought Secretary Shin made it clear.

00:18:31.068 --> 00:18:32.820
I offered to help you with the divorce,

00:18:32.903 --> 00:18:35.447
and I was supposed
to get the minister position in return.

00:18:36.198 --> 00:18:37.199
What did you say?

00:18:37.866 --> 00:18:38.909
Wait.

00:18:39.493 --> 00:18:41.537
Was it all Secretary Shin's decision?

00:18:43.247 --> 00:18:44.665
Is that true?

00:18:44.748 --> 00:18:45.833
As always,

00:18:45.916 --> 00:18:48.293
you have such good people around you.

00:18:48.377 --> 00:18:52.256
They do all the dirty work for you
without even being asked.

00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:56.468
Before, it was Su-yeon,
and now, it's Secretary Shin?

00:18:58.303 --> 00:19:00.973
Are you saying
Secretary Shin knew about this all along?

00:19:02.057 --> 00:19:04.560
This whole plan to get Ji-yu in trouble?

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:08.981
Was it also Secretary Shin
who released the video?

00:19:11.733 --> 00:19:13.026
I don't know.

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:16.405
All I did was
to ask the girl who filmed it

00:19:16.488 --> 00:19:19.449
if the video was backed up to the cloud.

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:22.703
I can't figure out
who took the video and spread it.

00:19:22.786 --> 00:19:23.996
And I don't need to know.

00:19:24.079 --> 00:19:25.831
Answer my question.

00:19:25.914 --> 00:19:28.000
Is it true that
Secretary Shin is involved?

00:19:28.083 --> 00:19:30.085
I kept my promise, so you keep yours.

00:19:31.211 --> 00:19:32.462
Tell me. Is it true?

00:19:32.546 --> 00:19:35.757
This has greatly affected
my school as well.

00:19:36.466 --> 00:19:38.552
Why do you think I took such a big risk?

00:19:38.635 --> 00:19:40.929
I made my move
after Secretary Shin's confirmation

00:19:41.013 --> 00:19:42.890
that she'd been delegated full authority.

00:19:42.973 --> 00:19:44.433
I didn't know about it.

00:19:45.392 --> 00:19:48.729
What kind of father would risk
his daughter's future like that?

00:19:49.938 --> 00:19:51.148
It makes sense.

00:19:51.815 --> 00:19:53.609
This felt way too risky.

00:19:54.484 --> 00:19:56.987
See to it that Su-yeon
is handled delicately

00:19:57.070 --> 00:20:00.532
You know what she can do
when she sets her mind to it.

00:20:01.116 --> 00:20:03.452
She can be ruthless even to her family,

00:20:03.535 --> 00:20:05.746
as you must've witnessed
rising to that position.

00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:07.915
Do you want me to talk to her?

00:20:07.998 --> 00:20:09.750
Stop meddling in our business.

00:20:11.084 --> 00:20:13.212
And whatever Secretary Shin promised,

00:20:14.171 --> 00:20:15.339
forget about it.

00:20:35.525 --> 00:20:38.487
I hear Longjing tea tastes best
on the third brew.

00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:44.076
YEAR 2012

00:20:44.785 --> 00:20:46.620
It's nice.

00:20:46.703 --> 00:20:48.330
Both the scent and color.

00:20:49.331 --> 00:20:50.332
Have some.

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:08.642
It doesn't taste as good
as your sister's brew, though.

00:21:09.226 --> 00:21:10.185
This is unfair.

00:21:12.062 --> 00:21:14.022
The illegal election was Su-yeon's idea.

00:21:14.648 --> 00:21:17.234
She plotted with Chairman Yang,
stabbed us in the back,

00:21:17.317 --> 00:21:18.777
and even spread the rumours.

00:21:23.782 --> 00:21:24.992
Just keep holding out.

00:21:26.159 --> 00:21:28.453
We've still got time
until the presidential election.

00:21:29.579 --> 00:21:31.373
If we can reveal that it was Su-yeon,

00:21:33.458 --> 00:21:34.584
we can turn the tables.

00:21:37.004 --> 00:21:40.966
Even if we reveal it,
I'll be the one to bear the risk.

00:21:42.801 --> 00:21:44.845
Whether it's your fault or Su-yeon's,

00:21:44.928 --> 00:21:47.180
the responsibility falls on me.

00:21:48.223 --> 00:21:49.349
Because I'm your father.

00:21:54.688 --> 00:21:57.316
I'll make my position clear at daybreak.

00:21:57.399 --> 00:21:58.942
I'll walk away from all this.

00:21:59.693 --> 00:22:03.405
You, too, should get out of politics
and focus on the foundation.

00:22:03.488 --> 00:22:05.324
You can't decide this that easily.

00:22:05.407 --> 00:22:06.533
Easily?

00:22:08.035 --> 00:22:10.329
I've come this far
aspiring to become president.

00:22:10.412 --> 00:22:14.291
So many of those who accused me
now hold seats in the National Assembly.

00:22:14.374 --> 00:22:15.834
You think I decided this easily?

00:22:15.917 --> 00:22:17.919
And what do you think I've been through?

00:22:21.089 --> 00:22:24.092
To you, I'm not your child.
I'm either a setback or an opportunity!

00:22:24.176 --> 00:22:25.093
You little…

00:22:25.177 --> 00:22:27.304
Do you know what I really want to know?

00:22:28.972 --> 00:22:31.558
Was her suicide really just a coincidence?

00:22:32.642 --> 00:22:34.811
-What?
-I'm talking about Su-yeon's dead mother.

00:22:36.563 --> 00:22:37.397
Stop.

00:22:37.481 --> 00:22:39.816
Maybe someone did it to win the election!

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:40.984
I said, stop!

00:22:45.155 --> 00:22:46.323
It wasn't suicide, was it?

00:23:15.644 --> 00:23:17.062
You were right, Father.

00:23:17.145 --> 00:23:19.981
Those people see my potential

00:23:20.065 --> 00:23:22.317
as no bigger than a teacup.

00:23:23.568 --> 00:23:25.737
They see me as someone

00:23:26.738 --> 00:23:29.366
who would grovel and do whatever he's told

00:23:30.158 --> 00:23:31.785
once handed a minister's post.

00:23:34.996 --> 00:23:36.790
Someone easy to manipulate.

00:23:36.873 --> 00:23:40.168
But that's not what I want.

00:23:43.088 --> 00:23:46.341
I want to see these two scumbags

00:23:46.424 --> 00:23:48.009
fall together.

00:23:50.262 --> 00:23:52.889
That's always been
the only thing that I wanted.

00:23:55.016 --> 00:23:56.977
So I should make them keep fighting.

00:23:57.602 --> 00:23:58.728
Until the end.

00:24:05.652 --> 00:24:06.695
Father.

00:24:08.113 --> 00:24:09.281
You'll see.

00:24:28.175 --> 00:24:29.176
This way, sir.

00:24:32.762 --> 00:24:35.056
PARTY FOR PEACE AND FREEDOM

00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:37.475
NEW VISION WITH THE SAME RESPONSIBILITY

00:24:37.559 --> 00:24:39.269
BAE YEONG-SEON

00:24:40.729 --> 00:24:43.023
PARTY FOR PEACE AND FREEDOM LEADER
BAE YEONG-SEON

00:24:45.734 --> 00:24:47.277
You need time?

00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:50.030
I thought you already agreed
to pass the special act.

00:24:52.407 --> 00:24:53.909
Like I said,

00:24:54.784 --> 00:24:56.203
I'm a member of my party.

00:24:56.286 --> 00:24:59.289
I'm obliged to listen to the voices

00:24:59.372 --> 00:25:01.041
within my party.

00:25:02.459 --> 00:25:03.710
Please give me some time.

00:25:04.753 --> 00:25:07.047
It sounds like time is on your side.

00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:10.717
I heard that
the divorce agreement fell through.

00:25:13.553 --> 00:25:15.639
There really are no secrets in this area.

00:25:15.722 --> 00:25:16.890
Catch a whiff of blood,

00:25:17.599 --> 00:25:21.144
then you pounce.
That's the unspoken rule in Yeouido.

00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:31.029
I hear hell is empty.

00:25:31.112 --> 00:25:35.283
Because all the evils are in Yeouido.

00:25:38.328 --> 00:25:42.082
I thought once the election was over,
I could finally put an end to this.

00:25:46.753 --> 00:25:48.964
Who do you think

00:25:50.507 --> 00:25:52.425
shattered the party's unified position

00:25:53.093 --> 00:25:54.094
in an instant?

00:26:02.102 --> 00:26:03.144
At first,

00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:07.107
I thought it was President Yu,
but I was wrong.

00:26:09.484 --> 00:26:10.485
It was

00:26:11.152 --> 00:26:12.779
your wife.

00:26:21.746 --> 00:26:22.872
That can't be true.

00:26:24.165 --> 00:26:26.126
The late Chairman Cha was

00:26:26.209 --> 00:26:29.129
the treasurer of my party
for quite a while.

00:26:30.171 --> 00:26:32.007
Many in my party

00:26:32.090 --> 00:26:35.635
are entangled with him from back then,
like it or not.

00:26:36.386 --> 00:26:38.138
And it seems that

00:26:38.221 --> 00:26:41.725
your wife inherited the knot to them.

00:26:43.351 --> 00:26:46.229
My wife really overturned
the party's stance overnight?

00:26:48.398 --> 00:26:51.276
As someone
who's already been through a divorce,

00:26:52.402 --> 00:26:54.112
let me give you some advice.

00:27:00.452 --> 00:27:01.911
The real evils

00:27:03.038 --> 00:27:04.331
are not in Yeouido.

00:27:04.956 --> 00:27:06.416
They're in divorce court.

00:27:08.251 --> 00:27:10.086
Sort out your divorce first.

00:27:11.463 --> 00:27:12.672
The special act

00:27:13.256 --> 00:27:14.758
comes next.

00:27:18.595 --> 00:27:21.556
Can I still count on you to be on my side?

00:27:23.475 --> 00:27:27.854
As your standing weakens,
Cha Su-yeon's influence will get stronger.

00:27:30.690 --> 00:27:32.901
And I don't want that either.

00:27:32.984 --> 00:27:34.903
My party's stance

00:27:34.986 --> 00:27:37.030
being dictated by some private citizen

00:27:37.113 --> 00:27:39.699
who isn't even a politician
or a party member,

00:27:40.909 --> 00:27:42.786
that can never happen.

00:27:46.998 --> 00:27:48.833
Does this answer your question?

00:27:55.548 --> 00:27:56.591
Hello.

00:27:56.674 --> 00:27:58.593
Let me talk to him briefly.

00:27:58.676 --> 00:27:59.677
No, you may not.

00:27:59.761 --> 00:28:01.513
I just have something to tell him.

00:28:01.596 --> 00:28:03.556
You can't. It's our security regulations.

00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:05.183
I know. Just for five minutes.

00:28:05.266 --> 00:28:06.518
No, just two minutes.

00:28:06.601 --> 00:28:07.769
Let him.

00:28:19.239 --> 00:28:20.740
I have a suggestion.

00:28:21.449 --> 00:28:23.243
Go ahead. I'm listening.

00:28:23.993 --> 00:28:27.497
Your wife is now trying to connect
with people in my party.

00:28:28.248 --> 00:28:29.999
She must be desperate.

00:28:31.084 --> 00:28:33.002
What about you, sir?

00:28:33.753 --> 00:28:34.921
Get to your point.

00:28:36.589 --> 00:28:38.591
Just take the divorce to court.

00:28:40.301 --> 00:28:43.805
I'll make sure
my party pushes the bill through.

00:28:51.396 --> 00:28:53.690
I thought
you were Assemblywoman Bae's person.

00:28:54.482 --> 00:28:55.650
Was I mistaken?

00:28:56.401 --> 00:28:59.487
Before that, I was Chairman Cha's person.

00:29:04.659 --> 00:29:06.870
And are you trying to be my person now?

00:29:10.874 --> 00:29:11.958
How can I trust that?

00:29:14.753 --> 00:29:17.756
It looks like
you're not as desperate as your wife.

00:29:18.882 --> 00:29:20.633
I'm as suspicious as her.

00:29:20.717 --> 00:29:23.928
What if I have your wife's hands tied?

00:29:24.012 --> 00:29:26.556
Would you trust me then?

00:29:39.068 --> 00:29:42.197
How can you reverse the party's stance
that was overturned overnight?

00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:45.241
While Cha Su-yeon has
Chairman Cha, a dead man,

00:29:45.325 --> 00:29:48.369
I have you, the president-elect
with a five-year term ahead.

00:29:48.453 --> 00:29:51.998
I'll have at least twice as many
supporters in the party as she does.

00:29:52.081 --> 00:29:56.878
Just show that
your divorce is real, not a performance.

00:29:56.961 --> 00:30:00.131
Then reversing the party's stance
will be a piece of cake.

00:30:00.215 --> 00:30:02.967
Why would people support you,
not Assemblywoman Bae?

00:30:07.388 --> 00:30:10.016
So you're the one who connected my wife

00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:11.851
to Party for Peace and Freedom.

00:30:14.729 --> 00:30:17.857
She overturned the party's stance
through you.

00:30:19.526 --> 00:30:23.446
And because you're like her hands in this,
it's up to you

00:30:23.530 --> 00:30:24.864
to tie her hands or not.

00:30:24.948 --> 00:30:28.660
You see, the first time is tough,
but the second time is easy.

00:30:30.703 --> 00:30:32.038
Just take it to court.

00:30:32.121 --> 00:30:34.916
Then I'll make sure
to reverse the party's stance.

00:30:34.999 --> 00:30:37.001
On one condition, though.

00:30:37.085 --> 00:30:40.421
I want you to take back the offer
you made to Assemblywoman Bae

00:30:40.505 --> 00:30:41.548
for prime minister.

00:30:42.674 --> 00:30:45.218
Assemblywoman Bae is all washed up.

00:30:45.301 --> 00:30:50.223
I'll find someone new
who suits you better.

00:30:51.057 --> 00:30:53.351
Are you using this
to grab power in the party?

00:30:53.935 --> 00:30:56.563
The National Assembly election is
in less than a year.

00:30:57.063 --> 00:30:58.773
Power in the party is power to nominate

00:30:58.857 --> 00:31:01.234
and the first step
toward the presidential race.

00:31:01.985 --> 00:31:04.654
You know how time flies in Yeouido.

00:31:06.489 --> 00:31:07.991
The late Chairman Cha was

00:31:08.074 --> 00:31:11.244
the treasurer of my party
for quite a while.

00:31:12.287 --> 00:31:14.455
Many in my party

00:31:14.539 --> 00:31:17.834
are entangled with him from back then,
like it or not.

00:31:18.543 --> 00:31:20.420
And it seems that

00:31:20.503 --> 00:31:23.923
your wife inherited the knot to them.

00:31:29.262 --> 00:31:32.223
The inheritance my wife got
from the late Chairman Cha,

00:31:33.016 --> 00:31:34.601
are you a part of it too?

00:31:36.227 --> 00:31:39.439
You stayed with Party for Peace
and Freedom and became Bae's aide.

00:31:40.565 --> 00:31:41.941
Was it also my wife's plan?

00:31:46.654 --> 00:31:48.990
Well, I won't deny it.

00:31:51.117 --> 00:31:52.535
But that ends here.

00:31:53.161 --> 00:31:55.872
Your partnership with my wife.

00:31:56.456 --> 00:31:59.584
I should walk a new path
with a new person.

00:32:01.377 --> 00:32:03.212
Then give it some thought.

00:32:39.707 --> 00:32:41.626
So it was really your doing?

00:32:44.504 --> 00:32:46.422
I decided that was the only way

00:32:47.090 --> 00:32:49.133
to get her to agree to the divorce.

00:32:49.217 --> 00:32:50.551
You decided?

00:32:50.635 --> 00:32:52.887
I clearly said I'd do the deciding.

00:32:52.971 --> 00:32:54.639
You also said we didn't have time.

00:32:54.722 --> 00:32:56.933
So you held Ji-yu against her?

00:32:58.393 --> 00:33:02.438
And risked stigmatizing her forever?

00:33:02.522 --> 00:33:05.483
You should attack
what would hurt her as much as hurt you.

00:33:05.566 --> 00:33:07.986
A fight is supposed to be
dangerous and painful.

00:33:10.405 --> 00:33:11.781
Do you even hear yourself?

00:33:11.864 --> 00:33:13.783
You must shed blood to fight.

00:33:14.367 --> 00:33:16.869
You can't fight without taking any blows.

00:33:16.953 --> 00:33:18.287
You're going to keep fighting?

00:33:20.665 --> 00:33:24.544
Once the special act is passed,
we can reveal the truth.

00:33:24.627 --> 00:33:25.962
While Ji-yu gets hurt?

00:33:26.045 --> 00:33:29.132
We can punish those responsible
and console unjust deaths.

00:33:29.215 --> 00:33:30.717
While Su-yeon bleeds?

00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:33.511
We can clear the names
of the victims-turned-wrongdoers.

00:33:33.594 --> 00:33:34.804
You--

00:33:34.887 --> 00:33:35.930
Wasn't that

00:33:36.723 --> 00:33:39.017
why you got into politics?

00:33:40.059 --> 00:33:42.770
Wasn't that why you became president?

00:33:46.441 --> 00:33:48.484
You said this on the first day we met.

00:33:48.568 --> 00:33:51.654
No victim should be called a wrongdoer.

00:33:59.495 --> 00:34:03.833
YEAR 2008

00:34:06.127 --> 00:34:07.587
Please read this.

00:34:17.221 --> 00:34:19.307
I'll take over. You can go.

00:34:23.269 --> 00:34:25.772
You couldn't go to the toilet
because of this, right?

00:34:25.855 --> 00:34:26.689
What?

00:34:27.565 --> 00:34:31.527
Yes. If I leave just for a second,
they keep clearing it away.

00:34:32.070 --> 00:34:33.488
So I'll stay here.

00:34:33.571 --> 00:34:34.655
You can take your time.

00:34:35.448 --> 00:34:36.699
Still…

00:34:37.366 --> 00:34:38.534
Hello!

00:34:39.911 --> 00:34:41.162
Hello.

00:34:41.829 --> 00:34:44.040
Hey!

00:34:44.123 --> 00:34:45.541
This is against the law!

00:34:47.502 --> 00:34:48.628
Did you register?

00:34:49.712 --> 00:34:51.005
Is this rally registered?

00:34:52.006 --> 00:34:53.299
Well…

00:34:53.382 --> 00:34:55.927
A one-man protest
doesn't require a registration.

00:34:58.346 --> 00:34:59.847
You know the law well.

00:34:59.931 --> 00:35:01.057
But

00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:02.266
you're bad at math.

00:35:03.101 --> 00:35:04.727
There are two of you.

00:35:04.811 --> 00:35:06.437
It's not a one-man protest.

00:35:06.521 --> 00:35:08.523
Hey, call the police right now.

00:35:08.606 --> 00:35:10.399
Tell them to take them away.

00:35:11.526 --> 00:35:12.860
Do you see this picket?

00:35:12.944 --> 00:35:15.488
It's fine
as long as it's one person holding it.

00:35:17.990 --> 00:35:19.450
Check if he's right.

00:35:19.534 --> 00:35:20.368
Yes, sir.

00:35:20.451 --> 00:35:23.287
Since you're good at math,
you must know how to read too.

00:35:24.831 --> 00:35:25.748
Then read this.

00:35:26.666 --> 00:35:29.752
A laborer who worked extremely hard
to build this hotel

00:35:29.836 --> 00:35:31.754
lost his legs from an industrial accident.

00:35:31.838 --> 00:35:33.589
And he's in the wrong?

00:35:33.673 --> 00:35:35.883
He was injured by professional negligence?

00:35:35.967 --> 00:35:38.719
You can't turn a victim into a wrongdoer!

00:35:38.803 --> 00:35:40.638
Such things must never happen!

00:35:40.721 --> 00:35:42.431
He did not breach any law.

00:35:46.352 --> 00:35:47.353
Seriously…

00:35:48.604 --> 00:35:49.564
Hey.

00:35:50.815 --> 00:35:51.816
There's two of them.

00:35:52.817 --> 00:35:55.361
How is this a one-man protest?

00:35:55.444 --> 00:35:56.654
I have to say

00:35:56.737 --> 00:35:59.073
Korean law is full of holes.

00:35:59.157 --> 00:36:01.200
It's completely messed up.

00:36:01.284 --> 00:36:02.493
Read it!

00:36:02.577 --> 00:36:04.453
You turned a victim into a wrongdoer!

00:36:04.537 --> 00:36:05.580
He's being wronged!

00:36:06.164 --> 00:36:08.791
You of all people should know!

00:36:08.875 --> 00:36:10.251
Read it!

00:36:10.835 --> 00:36:14.005
He was neglected for two hours!
He is permanently disabled now!

00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:16.507
You said you'd go as far as to

00:36:16.591 --> 00:36:19.343
divorce your wife
to get the special law passed.

00:36:19.427 --> 00:36:21.429
The divorce was for Su-yeon.

00:36:21.512 --> 00:36:24.682
I don't care
if it's for her or the special law.

00:36:24.765 --> 00:36:26.267
That day, I decided

00:36:26.350 --> 00:36:28.769
to make that divorce happen
no matter what.

00:36:29.645 --> 00:36:30.521
You…

00:36:30.605 --> 00:36:32.607
I decided I'd do everything that would

00:36:32.690 --> 00:36:35.067
make trouble for you as a president.

00:36:36.152 --> 00:36:38.237
I decided that I'd dirty my own hands

00:36:38.321 --> 00:36:40.740
and get criticized in your place.

00:36:41.324 --> 00:36:43.409
Why are you going this far?

00:36:45.453 --> 00:36:46.662
Ten years ago,

00:36:47.830 --> 00:36:50.041
when my husband died, he said

00:36:51.834 --> 00:36:53.544
he wished the world

00:36:54.086 --> 00:36:57.048
Gang-myeong inherited
would be different from his.

00:36:59.675 --> 00:37:02.136
That since I was doing an important job,

00:37:02.803 --> 00:37:04.805
I could make the world a better place.

00:37:05.973 --> 00:37:08.267
If both you and your wife couldn't do it,

00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:11.145
I decided to take it into my own hands.

00:37:12.146 --> 00:37:13.064
Going this far?

00:37:14.148 --> 00:37:15.942
I can do anything.

00:37:16.734 --> 00:37:18.527
I can do even worse than this.

00:37:24.033 --> 00:37:24.867
Leave.

00:37:26.702 --> 00:37:28.537
Don't show up in front of me again.

00:37:49.892 --> 00:37:51.143
Sorry to intrude.

00:37:51.227 --> 00:37:52.395
You have to see this.

00:37:52.895 --> 00:37:54.146
Your wife…

00:37:57.316 --> 00:38:01.112
The president-elect couple's
consented divorce fell through.

00:38:01.195 --> 00:38:05.283
Contrary to the view that the couple
would divorce by consent without a suit,

00:38:05.366 --> 00:38:07.243
President-elect's wife Cha

00:38:07.326 --> 00:38:09.704
officially announced
a breakdown of the consent.

00:38:10.496 --> 00:38:14.333
Ms. Cha's lawyer
has just started a press conference.

00:38:14.417 --> 00:38:17.628
Now, let's hear what he has to say.

00:38:17.712 --> 00:38:19.714
What's the reason it fell through?

00:38:19.797 --> 00:38:22.550
Even now, Ms. Cha is doing her best

00:38:22.633 --> 00:38:24.635
to prevent the worst situation.

00:38:24.719 --> 00:38:26.262
If you'll give us some time--

00:38:26.345 --> 00:38:28.264
Is it the alimony or custody?

00:38:28.347 --> 00:38:31.225
Are you saying President-elect
is at fault for the breakdown?

00:38:32.143 --> 00:38:36.314
I heard she'd countersuit
for the president-elect's wrongdoing.

00:38:37.148 --> 00:38:39.275
By wrongdoing, do you mean an affair?

00:38:41.152 --> 00:38:43.904
Do you mean his affair
is the reason behind the divorce?

00:38:47.575 --> 00:38:48.617
Is that true?

00:38:50.286 --> 00:38:51.370
As of now,

00:38:52.163 --> 00:38:53.372
I cannot disclose that.

00:38:53.456 --> 00:38:56.792
You cannot disclose it, but it's true?

00:38:56.876 --> 00:38:58.794
Then will you disclose it one day?

00:38:58.878 --> 00:39:02.340
It would be inappropriate
to reveal it here

00:39:03.257 --> 00:39:05.176
before the lawsuit starts.

00:39:05.259 --> 00:39:08.721
What wrong
did the president-elect do specifically?

00:39:08.804 --> 00:39:10.890
Are you going to reveal it strategically?

00:39:10.973 --> 00:39:12.808
Who is he having an affair with?

00:39:12.892 --> 00:39:13.726
What's the proof?

00:39:13.809 --> 00:39:15.227
That'll be all for today.

00:39:18.022 --> 00:39:19.940
Tell us more.

00:39:20.024 --> 00:39:21.025
Is there proof?

00:39:21.108 --> 00:39:22.985
Can you reveal who he is
having an affair with?

00:39:23.069 --> 00:39:24.904
Will the lawsuit happen soon?

00:39:24.987 --> 00:39:25.863
The next suit…

00:39:29.408 --> 00:39:30.451
Ma'am.

00:39:31.452 --> 00:39:33.120
Are you watching the news?

00:39:34.914 --> 00:39:37.333
I laid the groundwork for you.

00:39:38.709 --> 00:39:40.378
INCOMING CALL
SHIN HAE-RIN

00:39:42.046 --> 00:39:44.590
When will you give me
the conclusive information?

00:39:46.509 --> 00:39:47.968
You promised.

00:39:48.511 --> 00:39:49.845
It has to be

00:39:49.929 --> 00:39:51.722
an exclusive tip-off just to me.

00:39:54.225 --> 00:39:57.269
What happened? I told you to make sure
she couldn't hire a lawyer.

00:39:57.353 --> 00:39:58.562
How does she have a lawyer?

00:39:59.438 --> 00:40:00.272
Well…

00:40:00.356 --> 00:40:01.190
I apologize.

00:40:01.273 --> 00:40:04.693
Find out who he is
and dig up anything you can find

00:40:04.777 --> 00:40:06.320
to use against him.

00:40:06.404 --> 00:40:07.530
Secretary Shin!

00:40:10.157 --> 00:40:11.534
What do you think you're doing?

00:40:13.077 --> 00:40:14.995
I told you not to show yourself.

00:40:15.830 --> 00:40:18.916
Put your decision to fire me
on hold for now, please.

00:40:20.501 --> 00:40:22.253
Until the situation is dealt with,

00:40:22.336 --> 00:40:23.671
let me help until then.

00:40:23.754 --> 00:40:25.089
My decision is final.

00:40:26.215 --> 00:40:27.550
You're no longer my secretary.

00:40:32.012 --> 00:40:33.431
Then from now on,

00:40:34.223 --> 00:40:35.599
I'll do whatever I want.

00:40:37.852 --> 00:40:38.727
What?

00:40:39.019 --> 00:40:39.854
Secretary Shin?

00:40:39.937 --> 00:40:43.899
From this point onward, whatever I do
has nothing to do with you.

00:40:43.983 --> 00:40:47.069
I'm just doing it for my own sake.

00:40:47.153 --> 00:40:49.196
Secretary Lee will be the witness.

00:40:51.532 --> 00:40:52.741
You heard that?

00:40:52.825 --> 00:40:55.578
I'm no longer related to this place
or the president-elect.

00:40:55.661 --> 00:40:58.873
So you must not follow any of my orders.

00:41:02.418 --> 00:41:03.919
Say something, sir.

00:41:04.879 --> 00:41:06.338
Say she's wrong, please.

00:41:09.049 --> 00:41:10.259
She's right.

00:41:11.051 --> 00:41:12.887
She has nothing to do with us now.

00:41:16.974 --> 00:41:17.975
Secretary Shin.

00:41:41.415 --> 00:41:43.083
PRESIDENTIAL TRANSITION TEAM
SHIN HAE-RIN

00:41:53.344 --> 00:41:55.095
No, that's not true at all.

00:41:55.179 --> 00:41:58.140
It's fake news
that he cheated on his wife.

00:41:58.224 --> 00:41:59.391
Spouse at fault? No.

00:41:59.475 --> 00:42:02.102
It's not true that
the lawsuit concerns him

00:42:02.186 --> 00:42:03.729
as the spouse at fault.

00:42:19.995 --> 00:42:21.914
Ms. Cha is waiting.

00:42:25.501 --> 00:42:26.585
Thank you.

00:42:50.609 --> 00:42:51.694
This way.

00:42:58.617 --> 00:43:00.369
VICTIM: CHA SU-YEON
ASSAILANT: YOON KI-JU

00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:04.081
SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT

00:43:12.339 --> 00:43:15.843
You dealt with the reporters well,
considering it was your first time.

00:43:16.385 --> 00:43:17.970
Not too much, not too little.

00:43:18.887 --> 00:43:21.515
Most of all, you looked reliable.

00:43:21.599 --> 00:43:23.350
That's most important

00:43:23.434 --> 00:43:25.519
in representing me legally from now on.

00:43:25.603 --> 00:43:26.937
But do you really

00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:31.025
want me to take on your divorce lawsuit?

00:43:31.108 --> 00:43:33.235
Didn't you already agree to it?

00:43:34.194 --> 00:43:36.739
That you'd take on my divorce suit
if I settled Ki-ju's case.

00:43:40.492 --> 00:43:41.410
You took care of

00:43:41.493 --> 00:43:44.288
Ji-yu's case as well
by digging into those girls' past.

00:43:44.371 --> 00:43:47.166
The press conference went well too.
What's the matter?

00:43:48.876 --> 00:43:50.127
Well, still…

00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:53.672
No matter how I think about it,

00:43:54.340 --> 00:43:56.008
divorce case isn't my specialty.

00:43:56.091 --> 00:43:57.843
"Seon" in your name Kang Seon-ho.

00:43:57.926 --> 00:43:59.345
You said it meant "vicious."

00:44:02.389 --> 00:44:04.266
I need a lawyer who will fight viciously.

00:44:04.350 --> 00:44:06.060
It's against the President.

00:44:06.143 --> 00:44:08.479
And it is me who made him president.

00:44:13.776 --> 00:44:16.820
I'll stir up the public opinion first.

00:44:16.904 --> 00:44:19.490
That is politicians' weakest spot.

00:44:19.573 --> 00:44:22.534
The public opinion
which changes multiple times a day.

00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:25.871
Even more so now that he's the President.

00:44:29.458 --> 00:44:32.044
The target of the reporters

00:44:32.127 --> 00:44:34.213
will change from me to him.

00:44:35.964 --> 00:44:38.926
They'd feel a bigger sense of achievement
if they attacked

00:44:39.009 --> 00:44:43.889
the President who was having an affair
than his wife who bugged him for it.

00:44:43.972 --> 00:44:46.809
He's the one
who provided the cause for it,

00:44:46.892 --> 00:44:50.229
so they can say they're serving justice.

00:44:51.021 --> 00:44:53.315
They'll attack him as much as they did me,

00:44:53.399 --> 00:44:55.442
so they'll think it's fair to do so.

00:44:59.571 --> 00:45:02.491
The election was only a month ago.
Will the public sway?

00:45:03.909 --> 00:45:07.496
There's one thing I learned
about the public sentiment.

00:45:08.580 --> 00:45:09.665
The public

00:45:10.499 --> 00:45:11.834
isn't just a number.

00:45:14.795 --> 00:45:16.839
They're live people.

00:45:22.094 --> 00:45:23.095
Cha Su-yeon!

00:45:23.178 --> 00:45:24.221
-Out!
-Out!

00:45:24.304 --> 00:45:25.139
Cha Su-yeon!

00:45:25.222 --> 00:45:26.306
-Out!
-Out!

00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:27.224
Cha Su-yeon!

00:45:27.307 --> 00:45:28.517
-Out!
-Out!

00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:29.435
Cha Su-yeon!

00:45:29.518 --> 00:45:30.477
-Out!
-Out!

00:45:30.561 --> 00:45:31.395
Cha Su-yeon!

00:45:31.478 --> 00:45:32.396
-Out!
-Out!

00:45:32.479 --> 00:45:33.355
Cha Su-yeon!

00:45:33.439 --> 00:45:34.648
-Out!
-Out!

00:45:34.731 --> 00:45:35.607
Cha Su-yeon!

00:45:35.691 --> 00:45:36.900
-Out!
-Out!

00:45:39.236 --> 00:45:41.738
Look at her, she's so thick-skinned.

00:45:42.364 --> 00:45:43.824
She's shameless.

00:45:43.907 --> 00:45:44.992
You should be ashamed.

00:45:45.075 --> 00:45:47.953
Look at her standing tall
with her head held high.

00:45:48.036 --> 00:45:49.121
Exactly.

00:45:49.204 --> 00:45:50.539
Unbelievable.

00:45:59.256 --> 00:46:01.216
She's coming out.

00:46:01.300 --> 00:46:03.010
-Cha Su-yeon!
-Cha Su-yeon!

00:46:03.093 --> 00:46:05.429
Who are you to stop us?

00:46:05.512 --> 00:46:06.763
You don't understand us.

00:46:06.847 --> 00:46:09.600
-What did we do wrong?
-Get out of my way!

00:46:09.683 --> 00:46:11.018
Let me go!

00:46:11.101 --> 00:46:12.227
Let them go.

00:46:12.311 --> 00:46:13.979
It's okay, leave them be.

00:46:14.062 --> 00:46:15.147
Let them go.

00:46:16.231 --> 00:46:17.191
These people

00:46:18.484 --> 00:46:20.319
are my family.

00:46:20.402 --> 00:46:23.113
For over a decade, they've supported me

00:46:23.197 --> 00:46:26.450
and given me more love
than I ever deserve. They're my family.

00:46:27.910 --> 00:46:30.579
As a mom, and as a daughter,

00:46:31.163 --> 00:46:33.749
I have something to say to my family.

00:46:34.333 --> 00:46:36.418
Please give me some time.

00:46:40.464 --> 00:46:43.300
Please set up a tent
to shelter them from the rain.

00:46:43.884 --> 00:46:44.843
Yes, ma'am.

00:46:52.768 --> 00:46:53.769
My goodness.

00:46:57.898 --> 00:46:59.191
I'm sorry.

00:47:01.693 --> 00:47:03.529
I did something terrible.

00:47:04.905 --> 00:47:07.866
I disappointed you all.

00:47:27.553 --> 00:47:30.055
The public isn't just a number.

00:47:30.639 --> 00:47:32.432
They're live people.

00:47:36.812 --> 00:47:38.939
I'm not here

00:47:40.232 --> 00:47:42.276
as the wife of the president-elect

00:47:43.569 --> 00:47:45.988
or the First Lady.

00:47:46.697 --> 00:47:49.157
I'm here as a bad mom

00:47:49.741 --> 00:47:51.285
and an immature daughter

00:47:52.494 --> 00:47:54.663
who broke her family's hearts.

00:47:56.039 --> 00:48:00.043
The betrayal and anger that you,
my family, must've felt from my actions…

00:48:01.420 --> 00:48:03.755
I can't dare to fathom.

00:48:05.674 --> 00:48:08.385
But I'll accept whatever punishment I get.

00:48:10.429 --> 00:48:13.724
Don't worry
about me entering the Blue House

00:48:13.807 --> 00:48:16.602
and acting like the First Lady

00:48:17.394 --> 00:48:19.187
when I don't deserve it.

00:48:20.772 --> 00:48:23.984
You can scold me for my faults
as much as you like.

00:48:24.067 --> 00:48:25.110
But please.

00:48:26.695 --> 00:48:29.281
Although it's spring, it's still chilly.

00:48:31.074 --> 00:48:32.868
If you want to scold me,

00:48:34.036 --> 00:48:37.497
please do so under the tent
where you can avoid the rain.

00:48:46.006 --> 00:48:47.007
I'm sorry.

00:48:48.216 --> 00:48:50.260
I'm very sorry.

00:48:52.929 --> 00:48:55.098
It was terrible of me.

00:48:55.182 --> 00:48:56.350
I'm sorry.

00:49:23.001 --> 00:49:24.336
You're wrong.

00:49:24.419 --> 00:49:27.798
As you said, we're family.
Families don't do that to each other.

00:49:27.881 --> 00:49:28.715
She's right.

00:49:28.799 --> 00:49:30.676
You're my family,

00:49:30.759 --> 00:49:33.261
and so is she.

00:49:34.054 --> 00:49:35.764
This student is my family too.

00:49:37.349 --> 00:49:38.642
I'm sorry.

00:49:39.184 --> 00:49:40.811
I'm so sorry.

00:49:42.604 --> 00:49:44.106
Thank you, Bo-ra.

00:49:48.610 --> 00:49:51.029
I wanted to return this to you.

00:50:02.290 --> 00:50:04.710
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

00:50:06.086 --> 00:50:07.129
And thank you.

00:50:07.796 --> 00:50:09.589
I'm so sorry.

00:50:10.674 --> 00:50:12.509
I'm so sorry.

00:50:12.592 --> 00:50:13.719
I'm sorry.

00:50:13.802 --> 00:50:14.970
I'm so sorry.

00:50:15.053 --> 00:50:16.263
And thank you.

00:50:16.805 --> 00:50:20.183
People are always angry.

00:50:20.267 --> 00:50:22.978
They always look for someone
to take it out on.

00:50:23.562 --> 00:50:26.356
What will happen

00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:29.443
if the angry sentiment is
pointed at the President?

00:50:30.610 --> 00:50:34.030
When the balloon is
this close to bursting,

00:50:35.198 --> 00:50:39.411
we just have to prick it gently
with a needle called affair.

00:50:39.494 --> 00:50:41.705
Isn't that the same for them, though?

00:50:42.873 --> 00:50:46.668
If they make the same move,
people will criticize you badly.

00:50:47.878 --> 00:50:50.172
I've been criticized more than enough.

00:50:51.047 --> 00:50:52.090
But

00:50:52.674 --> 00:50:54.801
they won't be able to handle it.

00:50:55.594 --> 00:50:59.055
Because they've never fought so brutally
against the public.

00:51:00.056 --> 00:51:03.143
Up until now,
I was the one who dealt with it.

00:51:06.980 --> 00:51:09.357
Still, he's your husband.
He's your family.

00:51:09.441 --> 00:51:10.817
Yes, he is my family.

00:51:12.903 --> 00:51:14.070
A family…

00:51:15.822 --> 00:51:17.365
is always a nuisance.

00:51:19.367 --> 00:51:21.077
You wouldn't know.

00:51:25.540 --> 00:51:26.750
I have one too.

00:51:27.250 --> 00:51:28.418
My family.

00:51:31.505 --> 00:51:34.341
HASEONG DETENTION CENTER

00:51:50.816 --> 00:51:52.984
-You came.
-It must've been hard for you.

00:52:00.617 --> 00:52:01.618
What happened?

00:52:02.410 --> 00:52:04.663
Let's go. I'll explain on the way.

00:52:30.188 --> 00:52:32.941
It breaks and goes bad easily.

00:52:33.024 --> 00:52:34.985
Not to mention the stench when it does.

00:52:35.485 --> 00:52:39.489
Come to think of it, a family
is very much like tofu.

00:52:39.573 --> 00:52:41.074
Enough with your nonsense.

00:52:41.867 --> 00:52:44.619
You'll take on the divorce lawsuit?
Why?

00:52:44.703 --> 00:52:47.664
She got you out of jail,
and she pays me handsomely.

00:52:47.747 --> 00:52:50.333
Everyone is watching it.
Why would I say no?

00:52:50.417 --> 00:52:51.710
You sound very excited.

00:52:59.301 --> 00:53:00.886
See that?

00:53:00.969 --> 00:53:03.513
My friends
and even my old girlfriends from college

00:53:03.597 --> 00:53:05.974
are texting me now that I'm famous.

00:53:06.057 --> 00:53:07.225
She got her nose done.

00:53:07.309 --> 00:53:08.143
It looks good.

00:53:08.226 --> 00:53:11.897
Exactly, why would the other lawyers
have turned down such a good offer?

00:53:11.980 --> 00:53:13.064
It's obvious.

00:53:13.148 --> 00:53:14.900
What lawyer wouldn't want

00:53:14.983 --> 00:53:17.611
to get in Hyun Min-cheol's good books?

00:53:18.820 --> 00:53:20.280
And you don't want to?

00:53:22.782 --> 00:53:24.701
What if Min-cheol wants you on his side?

00:53:29.873 --> 00:53:32.584
Uncle. You must've forgotten,

00:53:33.209 --> 00:53:34.294
but I'm a lawyer.

00:53:34.377 --> 00:53:36.254
What if he promises you a position

00:53:37.088 --> 00:53:38.256
for betraying Cha Su-yeon?

00:53:39.674 --> 00:53:43.470
I already signed the attorney contract.

00:53:44.012 --> 00:53:46.139
I'll lose my lawyer license if I do that.

00:53:46.222 --> 00:53:48.224
What if in return for losing it,

00:53:48.308 --> 00:53:50.852
he'll hand you a better position?

00:53:58.068 --> 00:53:59.653
Then why did you do that?

00:53:59.736 --> 00:54:01.154
Do what?

00:54:01.237 --> 00:54:03.490
I heard that after Uncle Tae-hun died,

00:54:03.573 --> 00:54:05.283
she visited you several times.

00:54:06.076 --> 00:54:09.496
Why did you turn her down
when she asked for your help?

00:54:10.580 --> 00:54:13.708
I turned down Cha Su-yeon's offer.

00:54:14.209 --> 00:54:17.295
She said if I stopped
making an issue of the late Tae-hun,

00:54:18.088 --> 00:54:21.257
she'd do everything for me,
and I rejected her dirty hands.

00:54:21.841 --> 00:54:24.761
But you want to be her lawyer.

00:54:24.844 --> 00:54:27.013
You'll hold her dirty hands. Am I wrong?

00:54:28.640 --> 00:54:31.017
Being her lawyer doesn't mean

00:54:31.101 --> 00:54:34.020
I'll become one of her people.

00:54:35.355 --> 00:54:38.566
After I beat Hyun Min-cheol
in the lawsuit,

00:54:38.650 --> 00:54:40.568
who would be next?

00:54:41.444 --> 00:54:42.612
My final goal…

00:54:45.031 --> 00:54:46.282
is Cha Su-yeon.

00:54:46.366 --> 00:54:48.118
Can you even beat Min-cheol?

00:54:48.201 --> 00:54:49.369
Can you even win?

00:54:49.953 --> 00:54:51.913
Lawyers wouldn't be the only ones.

00:54:51.997 --> 00:54:55.500
Everyone in their right mind in Korea

00:54:56.001 --> 00:54:58.420
would have joined hands with Min-cheol.

00:54:59.462 --> 00:55:00.797
Can you really defeat him?

00:55:01.840 --> 00:55:04.467
It's Cha Su-yeon
who will go in the ring to fight.

00:55:08.513 --> 00:55:10.640
HASEONG MEMORIAL PARK

00:55:10.724 --> 00:55:11.891
Why are we here?

00:55:14.269 --> 00:55:18.523
It's the anniversary
of Uncle Tae-hun's death today.

00:55:18.606 --> 00:55:21.526
Grandma told me
to bring you straight here.

00:55:24.446 --> 00:55:25.739
Here.

00:55:40.837 --> 00:55:42.047
Who picked this suit?

00:55:42.130 --> 00:55:43.798
Why? You don't like it?

00:55:44.299 --> 00:55:45.759
I don't like the color.

00:55:46.301 --> 00:55:50.013
You can't say that. You wear
the factory jacket all year round.

00:55:50.597 --> 00:55:51.681
Hey.

00:55:51.765 --> 00:55:53.266
I have a lot of clothes.

00:55:53.349 --> 00:55:55.643
Fine, fine. I get it, so…

00:55:56.436 --> 00:55:58.730
Let's go now.

00:55:59.689 --> 00:56:01.024
Fine, let's go.

00:56:01.733 --> 00:56:03.818
ROT IN HELL, ARSONIST

00:56:03.902 --> 00:56:06.488
LATE DO TAE-HUN

00:56:07.822 --> 00:56:09.866
Grandma, what's all this?

00:56:09.949 --> 00:56:12.744
Heavens will punish them.

00:56:12.827 --> 00:56:16.873
I thought they'd stopped,
but they did this again.

00:56:16.956 --> 00:56:17.999
Give me that. I'll do it.

00:56:18.083 --> 00:56:21.461
Heavens will punish them.

00:56:21.544 --> 00:56:24.339
Was framing an innocent person not enough?

00:56:24.923 --> 00:56:26.841
Mom, we'll do it. Get some rest.

00:56:34.599 --> 00:56:36.392
My poor Tae-hun.

00:56:36.935 --> 00:56:39.646
He's wronged even after his death.

00:56:41.773 --> 00:56:44.609
Mom, stop. You'll collapse at this rate.

00:56:44.692 --> 00:56:46.319
You damn brat.

00:56:46.402 --> 00:56:49.280
How could you end up in a detention center
of all places?

00:56:51.407 --> 00:56:52.951
Oh, dear.

00:56:54.536 --> 00:56:56.246
Oh, dear.

00:56:56.329 --> 00:56:57.747
My Tae-hun.

00:57:00.208 --> 00:57:02.085
My poor Tae-hun.

00:57:12.011 --> 00:57:13.847
Darn it. Let's go.

00:57:20.728 --> 00:57:23.231
They're so thick-skinned.
They dare come here?

00:57:23.314 --> 00:57:26.025
-You--
-Calm down. Don't do it.

00:57:26.109 --> 00:57:27.944
Let's just go.

00:57:28.027 --> 00:57:30.947
They all lost their family
at the same time.

00:57:31.030 --> 00:57:33.158
Didn't we lose our family too?

00:57:33.241 --> 00:57:35.869
Why must Tae-hun be treated
as an arsonist?

00:57:35.952 --> 00:57:37.871
Why must he be treated as a sinner?

00:57:40.165 --> 00:57:43.084
They need someone to resent for it.

00:57:43.168 --> 00:57:45.753
Others might not understand that,
but we should.

00:57:47.297 --> 00:57:49.090
For 15 years,

00:57:49.174 --> 00:57:52.594
they shared the same grief
on the same day.

00:57:52.677 --> 00:57:55.805
The same goes for him
who lost both his parents overnight.

00:58:04.647 --> 00:58:06.608
MURDERER

00:58:06.691 --> 00:58:11.070
LATE DO TAE-HUN

00:58:14.616 --> 00:58:15.533
You brat.

00:58:29.797 --> 00:58:31.007
Yes.

00:58:33.801 --> 00:58:35.094
My dear.

00:58:38.723 --> 00:58:39.557
It's okay.

00:58:40.141 --> 00:58:42.810
He believed without a doubt

00:58:42.894 --> 00:58:45.480
that Tae-hun had killed his parents.

00:58:45.563 --> 00:58:49.400
When he belatedly found out
he was wrong, he was very shocked.

00:58:49.484 --> 00:58:50.693
You saw it too.

00:59:03.206 --> 00:59:04.582
I'm concerned about him.

00:59:05.708 --> 00:59:07.335
He wants to avenge his parents,

00:59:07.418 --> 00:59:10.964
but he might get hurt
by the lawsuit against Min-cheol.

00:59:11.047 --> 00:59:15.051
Coming from the one who went wild
trying to avenge Tae-hun's death?

00:59:15.134 --> 00:59:17.554
It's not the same.

00:59:19.097 --> 00:59:21.391
Seon-ho isn't even 30 yet.

00:59:21.474 --> 00:59:23.059
He has a bright future.

00:59:24.352 --> 00:59:26.938
That's how furious he must feel.

00:59:27.021 --> 00:59:30.358
You of all people should understand him.

00:59:31.693 --> 00:59:33.695
That's why I'm worried about him.

00:59:33.778 --> 00:59:35.196
You must protect him.

00:59:36.114 --> 00:59:38.324
So that they can't hurt him.

00:59:41.202 --> 00:59:44.998
LATE KANG IN-KYU, LATE SONG IN-KYEONG
THEIR ELDEST SON, KANG SEON-HO

00:59:49.127 --> 00:59:50.628
CHA SU-YEON

01:00:12.150 --> 01:00:15.236
KANG SEON-HO

01:00:25.288 --> 01:00:26.581
It's me, Cha Su-yeon.

01:00:26.664 --> 01:00:28.791
Are the preparations going smoothly?

01:00:29.334 --> 01:00:31.002
What we need is evidence.

01:00:31.753 --> 01:00:33.546
Proving the defendant's wrong

01:00:33.630 --> 01:00:36.507
and providing physical evidence
will be the key.

01:00:37.091 --> 01:00:38.217
Don't worry.

01:00:38.301 --> 01:00:39.969
I'll get the evidence for you.

01:00:41.346 --> 01:00:42.847
Can you at least give me

01:00:43.514 --> 01:00:45.433
a heads up about the evidence?

01:00:45.975 --> 01:00:47.226
You'll find out soon.

01:00:47.935 --> 01:00:50.313
It's evidence he could never refute.

01:00:50.897 --> 01:00:54.817
Just think about how to win the case
using that evidence.

01:00:56.361 --> 01:00:57.695
Don't worry about it.

01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:08.164
Evidence he could never refute…

01:01:09.707 --> 01:01:13.252
It's going to be mud-slinging anyway,
so fight as dirty as you can.

01:01:15.797 --> 01:01:17.840
Whether you win or lose,

01:01:18.341 --> 01:01:20.760
you both lose in the end.

01:01:59.340 --> 01:02:01.175
I wish to speak to the First Lady.

01:02:01.259 --> 01:02:04.595
Unbelievable. How dare you show up here?

01:02:04.679 --> 01:02:09.517
What would happen
if these words got out to the world?

01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:11.602
Give Su-yeon a chance.

01:02:11.686 --> 01:02:15.690
She's the one who'll guarantee our safety,
not the president-elect.

01:02:15.773 --> 01:02:17.608
What deal did you make with her?

01:02:17.692 --> 01:02:20.319
Hey, Min-cheol,
did Tae-hun start the fire?

01:02:20.403 --> 01:02:21.779
He's not a murderer!

01:02:21.863 --> 01:02:23.197
What would you do in my shoes?

01:02:23.990 --> 01:02:25.324
Who would you choose?

01:02:26.617 --> 01:02:28.619
