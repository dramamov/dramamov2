00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.833
In a joint operation in Southeast Asia

00:00:10.916 --> 00:00:12.916
over 20 Taiwanese suspects
were arrested

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.583
and extradited to Taiwan.

00:00:14.666 --> 00:00:17.625
As there is no mutual legal assistance
treaty in place,

00:00:17.708 --> 00:00:21.875
Taiwanese prosecutors could not
participate in the local investigation.

00:00:21.958 --> 00:00:24.041
The CIB came to the airport today

00:00:24.125 --> 00:00:27.333
to interrogate the suspects about
alleged involvement in fraud.

00:00:27.416 --> 00:00:30.166
After registering the suspects
and taking statements,

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.375
the CIB immediately released the suspects,

00:00:32.458 --> 00:00:34.500
causing widespread public outrage.

00:00:42.708 --> 00:00:43.541
Look at you.

00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:45.916
You've shaved.

00:00:47.625 --> 00:00:48.875
Handsome boy.

00:00:49.875 --> 00:00:52.708
- Less like a crook.
- You sure I'll get away with this?

00:00:52.791 --> 00:00:53.791
You'll be just fine.

00:00:55.916 --> 00:00:57.250
- Okay!
- Come on!

00:00:57.333 --> 00:00:58.625
- Yes!
- Come on.

00:00:58.708 --> 00:00:59.541
- Drink!
- Drink.

00:00:59.625 --> 00:01:01.333
- Drink!
- To Kai!

00:01:01.416 --> 00:01:02.250
To Kai!

00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:06.500
I gotta say, I'm totally not used to Kai
without his beard.

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.166
- Screw you!
- My bro looks pretty cool, alright?

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.333
- Cheers!
- Chug it! Chug it!

00:01:13.916 --> 00:01:15.916
That's nothing.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.375
Finish that can!

00:01:17.458 --> 00:01:18.541
That's right!

00:01:18.625 --> 00:01:20.833
Whoever drinks the most
goes to the compound!

00:01:22.791 --> 00:01:24.833
- You're on!
- In that case, I'm in!

00:01:24.916 --> 00:01:27.250
- Another round!
- Cheers!

00:01:27.333 --> 00:01:28.916
Who's she?

00:01:30.833 --> 00:01:31.958
Who are you after?

00:01:32.041 --> 00:01:33.541
Hey, who are you?

00:01:33.625 --> 00:01:35.125
I'm Hsu Hsin-yi's mother.

00:01:35.916 --> 00:01:37.416
- Huh?
- Mother? Whose mother?

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.708
Hsu-what's mother?

00:01:38.791 --> 00:01:40.041
It's your mom, right?

00:01:40.125 --> 00:01:41.208
- Wait.
- Hey.

00:01:41.291 --> 00:01:43.166
- Let's go to karaoke.
- The girl's mom?

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:44.166
Let's go.

00:01:46.541 --> 00:01:48.416
Motherfucker!

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.125
- Hey, lady, what are you doing?
- What do you want?

00:01:51.208 --> 00:01:52.500
Stop fighting!

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.041
- Get off!
- What are you doing?

00:01:57.125 --> 00:01:58.791
- Enough!
- Hey, Kai!

00:02:06.166 --> 00:02:07.250
How old are you?

00:02:11.375 --> 00:02:12.750
Are you still in school?

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.833
You look about my daughter's age.

00:02:19.916 --> 00:02:21.458
What the hell do I care?

00:02:24.541 --> 00:02:27.333
Sir, we've been waiting
for over two hours.

00:02:28.041 --> 00:02:29.833
Are you going to release her?

00:02:29.916 --> 00:02:32.125
Both parties were too emotional earlier

00:02:32.208 --> 00:02:33.791
to give statements.

00:02:33.875 --> 00:02:36.625
- They need time to calm down.
- It's been over two hours.

00:02:36.708 --> 00:02:38.291
They'll have calmed down by now.

00:02:39.041 --> 00:02:41.500
Miss, we'll make that judgment ourselves.

00:02:41.583 --> 00:02:42.791
Please don't interfere.

00:02:42.875 --> 00:02:44.791
- Then go and check--
- Save your breath.

00:02:45.375 --> 00:02:46.375
It's pointless.

00:02:47.916 --> 00:02:48.916
We'll have to wait.

00:02:51.458 --> 00:02:53.250
Apologies.

00:02:53.833 --> 00:02:55.583
Sorry for the trouble.

00:02:55.666 --> 00:02:56.500
Hsiao-chou.

00:02:57.041 --> 00:02:57.916
Hi, Mrs. Chang.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.250
Sorry, my daughter can be hard work.

00:03:00.333 --> 00:03:03.750
- Chang Shih-kai's mom.
- Please have a seat.

00:03:04.833 --> 00:03:06.416
Release Chang I-ting.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.500
- Thank you.
- Have some tea.

00:03:09.583 --> 00:03:11.458
Sure. Still got that tea I gave you?

00:03:11.541 --> 00:03:13.000
- Yes.
- Good.

00:03:13.083 --> 00:03:14.333
Tell me when you run out.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
You can leave once you've signed this.

00:03:20.625 --> 00:03:21.625
Sign here.

00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:32.958
Phone's over there.

00:03:40.708 --> 00:03:42.000
Thank you.

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:43.666
Thank you.

00:03:44.166 --> 00:03:46.458
- I'll drop by another day.
- We'll talk later.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.875
Why do they get to leave first?

00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:52.500
Have you even determined
who was in the right here?

00:03:53.083 --> 00:03:55.083
Justice will prevail.

00:03:56.458 --> 00:03:57.458
What did you say?

00:04:00.375 --> 00:04:02.291
She must take responsibility

00:04:02.375 --> 00:04:03.708
for her own sins.

00:04:07.041 --> 00:04:09.583
Your son committed so many heinous crimes.

00:04:10.208 --> 00:04:12.208
Who'll take responsibility for his sins?

00:04:12.666 --> 00:04:14.125
If my son has sinned,

00:04:14.916 --> 00:04:16.375
he will be punished.

00:04:17.083 --> 00:04:19.375
And that will be my cross to bear.

00:04:19.458 --> 00:04:22.666
I hope you'll be able to let go
of the resentment in your hearts.

00:04:40.583 --> 00:04:42.625
When can Chao Ching make a statement?

00:04:42.708 --> 00:04:44.750
You'll have to wait a little longer.

00:04:44.833 --> 00:04:46.083
How long exactly?

00:04:48.541 --> 00:04:50.958
Miss, we have more pressing matters
to deal with.

00:04:51.666 --> 00:04:53.083
Once again, please wait.

00:05:01.625 --> 00:05:02.791
We should go home.

00:05:02.875 --> 00:05:04.000
They won't let her go.

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:06.500
Why not?

00:05:07.458 --> 00:05:11.041
By law, they can hold someone in custody

00:05:11.125 --> 00:05:12.125
for up to 24 hours.

00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:19.916
He'll skip bail and flee the country.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.125
- You think he'll try to run?
- Guaranteed.

00:05:22.208 --> 00:05:23.375
Why don't you go home?

00:05:24.541 --> 00:05:26.333
I'll wait.

00:05:26.416 --> 00:05:28.833
- He doesn't have anything to fear.
- Why not?

00:05:28.916 --> 00:05:30.208
Call if anything happens.

00:05:30.291 --> 00:05:32.500
According to
Ministry of Justice statistics,

00:05:32.583 --> 00:05:35.708
only 21.9% of people arrested
for organized fraud

00:05:35.791 --> 00:05:37.750
are actually prosecuted for fraud.

00:05:37.833 --> 00:05:42.375
And only 0.6% are sentenced
to more than 3 years in prison.

00:05:42.458 --> 00:05:45.375
- Just 0.6%?
- In all these years, only 350 people

00:05:45.458 --> 00:05:47.250
have been sentenced.

00:05:47.333 --> 00:05:50.500
Listen to this. If I shouted abuse
at someone on the street,

00:05:50.583 --> 00:05:52.208
- how long would I get?
- How long?

00:05:52.291 --> 00:05:54.083
- Three months.
- Three months!

00:06:26.541 --> 00:06:29.458
04 INVESTIGATION DAY

00:06:30.458 --> 00:06:33.500
{\an8}SANCHING TAI CHI ASSOCIATION
SOUTHEAST ASIAN HQ

00:06:33.583 --> 00:06:37.375
{\an8}Our funds will be invested
in Southeast Asia.

00:06:37.458 --> 00:06:38.958
Take a look at this blueprint.

00:06:40.083 --> 00:06:41.666
This large area at the back

00:06:42.541 --> 00:06:46.416
is a commercial complex
that integrates shopping,

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:49.083
dining, entertainment, and culture.

00:06:49.166 --> 00:06:52.583
It will create jobs
and boost local tax revenues by over 30%.

00:06:52.666 --> 00:06:53.791
That's plenty.

00:06:53.875 --> 00:06:56.083
I just want two guarantees from you.

00:06:56.166 --> 00:06:57.583
First,

00:06:57.666 --> 00:07:00.208
you mustn't be associated
with fraud in any way.

00:07:01.083 --> 00:07:02.000
Second,

00:07:02.083 --> 00:07:04.916
all sources of funding must be legal.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:05.833
Understood?

00:07:06.666 --> 00:07:08.458
- Understood.
- Got it.

00:07:08.541 --> 00:07:11.083
Your son has caused such a huge uproar.

00:07:11.166 --> 00:07:13.166
If you really want to acquire this land,

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:15.625
you must cut all ties with him.

00:07:16.125 --> 00:07:17.916
- Do you understand?
- I do.

00:07:18.458 --> 00:07:19.375
Rest assured,

00:07:19.916 --> 00:07:23.208
I had nothing to do with anything of that.

00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:25.958
And it had nothing to do with you.

00:07:26.625 --> 00:07:29.625
Only positive things
will happen on your island.

00:07:29.708 --> 00:07:30.916
Nothing negative.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.916
Come on. We're not bad people.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.583
You know, we're good people.
Good Samaritans, right?

00:07:36.666 --> 00:07:38.916
- We're all good Samaritans.
- Good Samaritans.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.166
- I hope you keep your word.
- I will.

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:43.333
Relax. Have some tea.

00:07:44.041 --> 00:07:45.208
Thank you, kind sir.

00:07:54.708 --> 00:07:58.833
Remember what I just told you
or I won't be able to help.

00:07:58.916 --> 00:08:00.166
- No problem.
- Okay.

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:01.083
Absolutely.

00:08:01.166 --> 00:08:02.791
I hope to hear from you soon.

00:08:02.875 --> 00:08:04.208
- Don't worry.
- Okay.

00:08:04.291 --> 00:08:05.375
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

00:08:05.458 --> 00:08:06.458
I'm counting on you.

00:08:07.791 --> 00:08:08.833
Thank you, kind sir.

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:11.500
Thank you.

00:08:34.458 --> 00:08:35.916
Place it in the center.

00:08:42.916 --> 00:08:44.500
- Hello, Master.
- Hello, Master.

00:08:45.583 --> 00:08:46.791
Hello, Master.

00:08:49.416 --> 00:08:50.666
Hello, Master Yueh-shan.

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:52.000
Yueh-hsin, come with me.

00:08:52.083 --> 00:08:53.083
Yes.

00:08:59.833 --> 00:09:01.333
The invitations are ready.

00:09:03.375 --> 00:09:05.125
This gold is too flashy.

00:09:05.666 --> 00:09:06.833
You picked it.

00:09:07.625 --> 00:09:09.458
Tone it down. Change it at once.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.333
Mom.

00:09:16.416 --> 00:09:19.250
Give me another credit card.
I'm going shopping.

00:09:19.333 --> 00:09:21.458
Stop shopping
if your cards are maxed out.

00:09:21.541 --> 00:09:23.250
And stop posting that stuff online.

00:09:23.333 --> 00:09:25.791
Flaunting our wealth?
Know how many eyes are on us?

00:09:25.875 --> 00:09:28.208
At least wait until
the mourning period's over.

00:09:29.083 --> 00:09:30.083
Go.

00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:46.833
Hello?

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.708
- Mom, it's me.
- Who?

00:09:50.416 --> 00:09:52.166
Chang Shih-kai, your son.

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:53.333
Your son!

00:09:55.625 --> 00:09:56.958
Lunatic.

00:10:06.375 --> 00:10:09.000
A true scammer. She's super cautious.

00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:11.416
So what do we do now?

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:12.333
Call again.

00:10:12.416 --> 00:10:13.833
She won't believe it.

00:10:16.375 --> 00:10:17.958
Stun him for now.

00:10:18.041 --> 00:10:18.875
What?

00:10:33.708 --> 00:10:34.833
Hey, look up.

00:10:35.833 --> 00:10:36.833
Look here.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
He doesn't look miserable enough.

00:10:52.625 --> 00:10:53.791
Here.

00:10:53.875 --> 00:10:54.791
Go.

00:10:59.916 --> 00:11:01.250
Mom, it's me.

00:11:01.833 --> 00:11:03.375
Prepare 40 million.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.375
Or they'll kill me.

00:11:09.375 --> 00:11:11.708
- Why don't you do a video call?
- Shut it.

00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:14.041
Right. Why not do a video call?

00:11:14.708 --> 00:11:16.666
We'd have no control over what he says.

00:11:26.666 --> 00:11:27.875
Christina.

00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:29.958
What's up with you today?
Feeling down?

00:11:30.041 --> 00:11:31.291
Not buying anything?

00:11:31.875 --> 00:11:33.625
I'm fine. I've had a look around.

00:11:33.708 --> 00:11:34.958
There's nothing special.

00:11:35.041 --> 00:11:37.291
Hey, this outfit's super pretty.

00:11:38.041 --> 00:11:39.458
Don't you think?

00:11:39.541 --> 00:11:40.416
Let me see.

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:42.541
Look at the color. It's so classy.

00:11:42.625 --> 00:11:44.416
Christina.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.333
- Hey, this outfit's next level.
- I agree.

00:11:48.416 --> 00:11:50.166
- It suits you.
- The color, too.

00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:51.750
- You'd look great.
- Right.

00:11:51.833 --> 00:11:54.625
- It's so you.
- I don't suit such tight-fitting clothes.

00:11:54.708 --> 00:11:56.791
- It'll show off your figure.
- Super sexy.

00:11:56.875 --> 00:11:58.958
- What do you know?
- This outfit only works

00:11:59.041 --> 00:12:00.375
with curves like yours.

00:12:22.583 --> 00:12:23.541
Thank you.

00:12:23.625 --> 00:12:24.750
Let's go.

00:12:24.833 --> 00:12:26.791
- Why didn't you wear it out?
- Show us.

00:12:26.875 --> 00:12:28.916
I tried it but it wasn't my style.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.833
So I changed out of it. Let's go.

00:12:30.916 --> 00:12:32.416
- Hit the next store?
- Okay.

00:12:33.166 --> 00:12:34.333
Miss, sorry.

00:12:35.166 --> 00:12:36.000
What?

00:12:36.666 --> 00:12:37.916
This is broken.

00:12:43.541 --> 00:12:44.541
What?

00:12:44.625 --> 00:12:45.750
This is broken here.

00:12:45.833 --> 00:12:48.083
No. No, not me. Not me.

00:12:48.166 --> 00:12:49.958
- I checked it.
- I said it wasn't me.

00:12:50.041 --> 00:12:52.041
Before I gave you, I checked it.

00:12:52.125 --> 00:12:54.833
- Why do you say--
- I checked it before I gave it to you.

00:12:54.916 --> 00:12:58.000
- You made this broken.
- The quality's as lousy as your service!

00:12:58.083 --> 00:13:01.083
- It's perfectly fine.
- Miss! You need to pay for this.

00:13:01.166 --> 00:13:03.875
- No, it's not my problem. Okay?
- You broke this.

00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:05.750
- You pay. It's broken.
- I don't pay.

00:13:05.833 --> 00:13:07.458
- You need to pay.
- That's okay.

00:13:07.541 --> 00:13:09.083
- Don't pay.
- Let her sort it.

00:13:09.166 --> 00:13:10.000
I had already--

00:13:10.083 --> 00:13:12.250
I saw it was kind of torn to start with.

00:13:12.333 --> 00:13:14.083
‘Cause this is pretty embarrassing.

00:13:15.375 --> 00:13:17.083
Just let her handle it.

00:13:17.666 --> 00:13:19.208
She can just buy it. End of.

00:13:19.291 --> 00:13:20.958
Everything will be alright.

00:13:40.416 --> 00:13:42.125
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:13:56.458 --> 00:13:57.458
Drink, please.

00:14:11.041 --> 00:14:12.041
This way.

00:14:16.833 --> 00:14:17.833
Thank you.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.208
You have sincere hearts.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.416
May the gods bless you.

00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:49.083
May the gods bless you.

00:14:49.708 --> 00:14:53.291
Since the Southeast Asian branch
was established half a year ago,

00:14:53.416 --> 00:14:55.250
we have raised five million dollars

00:14:55.333 --> 00:14:57.750
and improved the lives of 200 members.

00:14:57.833 --> 00:14:59.458
Thanks to your acts of kindness.

00:15:00.041 --> 00:15:02.750
To help even more members
receive the gods' blessings,

00:15:02.833 --> 00:15:05.750
we will officially launch
our charity fund next week.

00:15:06.416 --> 00:15:08.625
We've already received our first donation.

00:15:08.708 --> 00:15:10.333
I'm sure you know who made it.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.083
Yueh-hsin,
please come up and say a few words.

00:15:31.208 --> 00:15:34.000
Ever since my sinful son passed away,

00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:37.541
I've dreamed
of a beam of light every night.

00:15:37.625 --> 00:15:38.958
In this light,

00:15:40.458 --> 00:15:41.875
I see my son.

00:15:43.208 --> 00:15:44.875
He seems to be suffering.

00:15:45.625 --> 00:15:48.333
Like he wants to say something,
but can't speak.

00:15:50.166 --> 00:15:51.500
When I see this vision…

00:15:54.583 --> 00:15:56.666
I actually feel an inner peace.

00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:04.166
Because I know…

00:16:06.208 --> 00:16:10.166
this is the gods telling me
how grievous my son's sins are.

00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:13.333
I thank the gods for this chance to atone.

00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:14.833
I have decided

00:16:15.625 --> 00:16:17.041
to donate all of my assets

00:16:18.041 --> 00:16:21.833
to the Sanching Tai Chi Association's
Southeast Asian Charity Foundation.

00:16:22.791 --> 00:16:23.791
From this day forth,

00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:27.125
I will devote my life
to spiritual cultivation

00:16:27.208 --> 00:16:29.166
to atone for my son's sins.

00:16:29.250 --> 00:16:33.625
I hope that one day,
all his sins will be washed away.

00:16:37.333 --> 00:16:40.583
The gods are wise
and know that you are kind.

00:16:40.666 --> 00:16:42.208
You are a Good Samaritan.

00:16:42.291 --> 00:16:43.916
We are all Good Samaritans.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
- Good Samaritans.
- Good Samaritans.

00:16:52.791 --> 00:16:54.875
Good Samaritans.

00:16:59.416 --> 00:17:01.125
Good Samaritans.

00:17:13.125 --> 00:17:13.958
Thank you.

00:17:20.458 --> 00:17:21.458
No thanks.

00:17:31.291 --> 00:17:33.416
I've been dating a new guy lately.

00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:34.833
Him. What do you think?

00:17:34.916 --> 00:17:37.500
- Wow.
- He's pretty hot.

00:17:37.583 --> 00:17:38.875
His birthday's next week.

00:17:38.958 --> 00:17:41.416
You should come.
I bet his friends will be there.

00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:43.041
What are their families like?

00:17:43.791 --> 00:17:46.500
Christina, you're obsessed
with guys' families recently.

00:17:46.583 --> 00:17:48.250
- Right. Does it matter?
- Exactly.

00:17:48.833 --> 00:17:50.958
Being emotionally compatible matters too.

00:17:51.041 --> 00:17:53.250
My dad really wants me to get married.

00:17:53.333 --> 00:17:55.666
The guy has to have
a similar background,

00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:57.916
and if I don't get married this year,

00:17:58.708 --> 00:18:01.375
he'll make me
take over the family business in Fujian.

00:18:01.458 --> 00:18:03.083
You know I don't want that.

00:18:03.166 --> 00:18:04.500
I want to work in fashion.

00:18:05.458 --> 00:18:07.750
Although our family's business
is lucrative,

00:18:08.875 --> 00:18:09.958
I'm not interested.

00:18:10.041 --> 00:18:12.125
Tell your mom
you want to be an influencer.

00:18:12.208 --> 00:18:13.458
- Ask her for help.
- Right.

00:18:13.541 --> 00:18:14.833
Let your siblings run it.

00:18:14.916 --> 00:18:16.541
- Yes.
- Don't you have a brother?

00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:18.750
My brother…

00:18:19.458 --> 00:18:20.375
We haven't been--

00:18:20.458 --> 00:18:22.500
- She has a brother?
- You have a brother?

00:18:22.583 --> 00:18:23.833
Didn't I tell you before?

00:18:23.916 --> 00:18:25.875
- Is he single?
- Introduce him to her.

00:18:25.958 --> 00:18:27.083
Hi, long time no see.

00:18:29.625 --> 00:18:30.708
Your friend?

00:18:30.791 --> 00:18:31.708
I don't know her.

00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:33.833
You've forgotten me?

00:18:34.625 --> 00:18:36.250
You were discussing her brother?

00:18:36.333 --> 00:18:37.875
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:18:37.958 --> 00:18:38.958
Her brother's dead.

00:18:41.166 --> 00:18:43.291
- Sorry.
- Apologies.

00:18:44.333 --> 00:18:45.500
She's doing just fine.

00:18:45.583 --> 00:18:48.083
Do you know what business
her family is in?

00:18:48.166 --> 00:18:49.791
A factory in Fujian, right?

00:18:49.875 --> 00:18:51.750
- It's sure something.
- My family--

00:18:51.833 --> 00:18:55.083
I think you'd be perfect to take over.
Right up your alley.

00:18:55.166 --> 00:18:56.708
What exactly do they do?

00:18:56.791 --> 00:18:58.583
- You're so rich. It must be…
- Right.

00:18:58.666 --> 00:19:00.916
Her riches cost my daughter her life.

00:19:02.958 --> 00:19:04.041
Enough of your BS!

00:19:05.583 --> 00:19:06.875
I'm not done talking.

00:19:06.958 --> 00:19:09.833
- Christina, we'd better be going.
- Wait up, I'll come too.

00:19:09.916 --> 00:19:11.458
Fuck you!

00:19:11.541 --> 00:19:13.875
I warn you.
Shut your face or I'll rip it off!

00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:30.250
Are you okay?

00:19:32.541 --> 00:19:33.583
Let me help you.

00:20:01.833 --> 00:20:03.375
You're going to catch a cold.

00:20:06.083 --> 00:20:07.625
Here, your bag.

00:20:07.708 --> 00:20:08.541
Thank you.

00:20:10.666 --> 00:20:13.166
How about you go upstairs
to take a shower?

00:20:13.250 --> 00:20:15.500
I can arrange for someone
to wash your clothes.

00:20:15.583 --> 00:20:18.958
My room card. If you're done,
just leave it at reception.

00:20:23.291 --> 00:20:25.916
I'm going to stay here.
It's just you who goes up.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.125
No worries.

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:31.500
Thank you.

00:20:36.875 --> 00:20:40.125
Sorry, miss.
You have not paid for this table yet.

00:20:40.208 --> 00:20:41.333
It's okay.

00:20:41.416 --> 00:20:44.333
- Just put it on my room. My room is 31--
- 3115.

00:20:44.416 --> 00:20:45.833
I know who you are.

00:20:47.875 --> 00:20:49.875
Just take your time. No rush.

00:20:52.458 --> 00:20:53.625
Thank you.

00:21:58.208 --> 00:21:59.375
Hello, madam.

00:21:59.458 --> 00:22:01.166
Your laundry is done.

00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:25.333
Excuse me.

00:22:26.791 --> 00:22:28.291
All set. We'll hand it to him.

00:22:29.541 --> 00:22:30.541
What's his name?

00:22:31.791 --> 00:22:33.458
- His name.
- Who?

00:22:33.541 --> 00:22:35.916
The guy in this room.

00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:39.500
My apologies, miss.

00:22:39.583 --> 00:22:42.666
We are not authorized
to give out our customers' information.

00:22:43.833 --> 00:22:44.833
We are friends.

00:22:45.791 --> 00:22:46.625
Close friends.

00:22:46.708 --> 00:22:48.583
Then you already know him, right?

00:22:49.166 --> 00:22:52.250
- Of course I know him.
- But you don't know his name.

00:22:59.208 --> 00:23:00.625
This is my number.

00:23:00.708 --> 00:23:02.750
Can you tell him to call me back?

00:23:05.708 --> 00:23:07.000
Okay.

00:23:07.083 --> 00:23:08.333
You promise?

00:23:08.416 --> 00:23:09.333
Certainly, miss.

00:23:09.916 --> 00:23:10.750
Okay, thank you.

00:23:16.916 --> 00:23:17.750
What was that?

00:23:18.625 --> 00:23:20.458
How's it going with Chang I-ting?

00:23:20.541 --> 00:23:21.750
Christina?

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.833
Christina Chang, a wealthy heiress.

00:23:25.416 --> 00:23:27.416
Her family does business in Fujian.

00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:29.583
She's here because she doesn't want to

00:23:29.666 --> 00:23:30.958
run the family business.

00:23:31.041 --> 00:23:33.083
Her dream is a career in fashion.

00:23:34.583 --> 00:23:35.916
What about her mom?

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.458
You mean Yueh-hsin, the Good Samaritan?

00:23:38.541 --> 00:23:41.708
She just donated all her money
to the Tai Chi Association.

00:23:42.416 --> 00:23:44.666
- How much money?
- One million.

00:23:45.333 --> 00:23:47.708
That aligns
with our account investigation.

00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:49.708
I get the feeling

00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:53.250
that the association
must be helping them launder money.

00:23:53.333 --> 00:23:55.291
The association's accounts are public.

00:23:55.375 --> 00:23:59.291
And their monthly transactions
are only six or seven figures.

00:23:59.375 --> 00:24:00.333
Yes.

00:24:00.416 --> 00:24:04.041
But Chang Shih-kai was confident
of getting 40 million.

00:24:04.125 --> 00:24:06.708
So they must have more than that.

00:24:09.916 --> 00:24:10.916
Then where

00:24:12.083 --> 00:24:14.000
exactly have they hidden their money.

00:24:14.416 --> 00:24:16.416
CHARITY GALA

00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:26.958
What did his mom say?

00:24:28.083 --> 00:24:29.458
She doesn't believe it.

00:24:30.333 --> 00:24:31.291
Why not?

00:24:31.875 --> 00:24:33.541
Didn't you show her the video?

00:24:33.625 --> 00:24:35.416
She said the video was fake.

00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:41.083
I just don't think she wants to pay up.

00:24:41.166 --> 00:24:45.125
I was worried about this.
And now she knows we have Chang Shih-kai,

00:24:45.208 --> 00:24:46.250
she'll call the cops.

00:24:46.333 --> 00:24:48.000
What good will that do?

00:24:48.083 --> 00:24:49.875
If the police catch him again,

00:24:49.958 --> 00:24:51.875
- he'll just die again.
- Hey.

00:24:51.958 --> 00:24:55.541
We kidnapped a prisoner on death row.
We'll go down for years.

00:24:55.625 --> 00:24:56.958
Then what do we do?

00:24:57.666 --> 00:24:59.333
We could just run?

00:24:59.416 --> 00:25:01.666
We can't. What would we do with him?

00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:03.875
If he gets captured, he'll rat us out.

00:25:09.458 --> 00:25:10.958
We'll take care of him now.

00:25:11.541 --> 00:25:13.625
Relax. My mom won't call the police.

00:25:15.041 --> 00:25:17.125
She just doesn't believe I'm still alive.

00:25:18.291 --> 00:25:20.208
If you can prove it,

00:25:20.291 --> 00:25:22.083
she'll give you the money.

00:25:22.666 --> 00:25:24.041
How will we prove it?

00:25:27.250 --> 00:25:28.833
Take another video.

00:25:28.916 --> 00:25:30.916
I told you she didn't believe the video.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:32.625
Do it my way this time.

00:25:42.041 --> 00:25:42.875
Front on.

00:25:46.833 --> 00:25:49.375
Turn the flashlight off.
Turn it on when I say so.

00:25:52.750 --> 00:25:53.583
Now.

00:25:58.333 --> 00:26:01.125
It's April 10th, 2024.

00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:05.750
Film the date.

00:26:09.208 --> 00:26:10.208
Go.

00:26:13.041 --> 00:26:14.125
Mom,

00:26:14.208 --> 00:26:15.416
this is Chang Shih-kai.

00:26:16.041 --> 00:26:17.750
This is today's newspaper.

00:26:17.833 --> 00:26:19.583
It's proof I'm still alive.

00:26:21.208 --> 00:26:23.375
I'll explain
what happened after I get out.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.416
In any case, prepare 40 million
to pay for my release.

00:26:28.458 --> 00:26:32.041
I know it'll be difficult
getting that much money out of the blue.

00:26:32.625 --> 00:26:34.375
But don't worry.

00:26:34.458 --> 00:26:36.833
Once I get out, I'll sort everything.

00:26:39.416 --> 00:26:40.250
Done.

00:26:40.958 --> 00:26:43.291
Remember to edit out
the beginning and end.

00:26:43.375 --> 00:26:45.375
Give the newspaper and video to my mom.

00:26:45.458 --> 00:26:46.625
She'll believe it then.

00:26:48.958 --> 00:26:50.041
He sure is a pro.

00:26:58.375 --> 00:26:59.333
Hey.

00:26:59.416 --> 00:27:00.958
Get me some water.

00:27:01.041 --> 00:27:02.375
I'm dying of thirst.

00:27:03.666 --> 00:27:05.916
If I die, you won't get any money.

00:27:37.541 --> 00:27:40.166
Master Yueh-shan
would like you to go downstairs.

00:27:42.208 --> 00:27:43.041
What is it?

00:27:44.958 --> 00:27:46.416
Wang Hui-chun is downstairs.

00:27:47.416 --> 00:27:48.416
Who?

00:27:50.666 --> 00:27:54.208
I'm sorry, this is private property.
Please leave.

00:27:55.750 --> 00:27:58.208
Sorry, please leave.

00:27:58.291 --> 00:27:59.291
I'll leave shortly.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:01.500
But this is private property.

00:28:01.583 --> 00:28:03.625
What's she doing here? Asking for money?

00:28:03.708 --> 00:28:06.583
No. She donated money
to apply for membership.

00:28:06.666 --> 00:28:09.625
- Membership?
- If you don't leave, I'll call the police.

00:28:09.708 --> 00:28:11.791
This is private property. Please leave.

00:28:11.875 --> 00:28:13.500
Sorry, please leave.

00:28:13.583 --> 00:28:14.833
Wait.

00:28:14.916 --> 00:28:17.708
Good Samaritan! Good Samaritan!

00:28:20.208 --> 00:28:22.666
What are you doing?
Stand up and talk. Come.

00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:24.000
I saw your son.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.375
What's this nonsense? My son is dead.

00:28:28.458 --> 00:28:29.916
I know.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.708
Where did you see him?

00:28:31.791 --> 00:28:32.791
My home.

00:28:33.916 --> 00:28:36.666
Every night, he sits by my bed.

00:28:39.125 --> 00:28:42.000
Miss, that is your inner demon.

00:28:42.083 --> 00:28:44.708
Let go of your hatred
and choose forgiveness,

00:28:44.791 --> 00:28:46.750
and your inner demon will disappear.

00:28:46.833 --> 00:28:47.833
Really?

00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:51.291
In truth, after he died,

00:28:52.166 --> 00:28:54.500
I wanted to let everything go

00:28:55.083 --> 00:28:56.375
and start over.

00:28:56.916 --> 00:28:58.666
But your son

00:28:58.750 --> 00:29:00.541
killed my good friend's daughter.

00:29:00.625 --> 00:29:04.208
And my daughter is still lying in a coma.

00:29:04.291 --> 00:29:06.416
I can't do it!

00:29:07.875 --> 00:29:09.625
You must still choose forgiveness.

00:29:09.708 --> 00:29:11.833
Then your inner demons will disappear.

00:29:15.208 --> 00:29:16.583
You're right.

00:29:16.666 --> 00:29:18.791
So I want to join your association.

00:29:21.375 --> 00:29:23.458
Gods, have mercy.

00:29:23.541 --> 00:29:25.208
Good Samaritans,

00:29:25.291 --> 00:29:30.041
if you can help the perpetrator's
mother extinguish the guilt in her heart,

00:29:30.125 --> 00:29:32.375
surely you can help me,
the victim's mother,

00:29:32.458 --> 00:29:34.458
let go of the resentment in my heart?

00:29:36.291 --> 00:29:38.458
Gods, have mercy!

00:29:39.083 --> 00:29:40.000
Have mercy!

00:29:40.083 --> 00:29:41.750
Help free me of my resentment.

00:29:42.916 --> 00:29:45.291
- Gods, have mercy!
- We'll let her join.

00:29:45.375 --> 00:29:47.083
- Please.
- Good Samaritans.

00:29:47.166 --> 00:29:49.000
Good Samaritans.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:51.500
Good Samaritans.

00:29:55.541 --> 00:29:56.875
What exactly do you want?

00:29:58.875 --> 00:30:00.875
I just want to be like you,

00:30:00.958 --> 00:30:02.708
a Good Samaritan.

00:30:36.791 --> 00:30:37.625
Hello?

00:30:37.708 --> 00:30:38.833
Hello, sir.

00:30:38.916 --> 00:30:42.750
The lady from this afternoon
is here looking for you again.

00:30:42.833 --> 00:30:45.250
Should I still tell her
you're not in your room?

00:30:45.333 --> 00:30:47.500
It's okay.
Just tell her to wait downstairs.

00:30:47.583 --> 00:30:50.083
- I'm going to go down now.
- No problem, sir.

00:30:55.833 --> 00:30:57.875
- All good?
- Yes.

00:31:01.916 --> 00:31:04.250
Just let me go to his room, okay?

00:31:04.333 --> 00:31:05.791
We… We're really friends.

00:31:06.375 --> 00:31:08.791
- He's coming, I promise.
- Motherfucker.

00:31:08.875 --> 00:31:10.583
Bet you never gave him my number.

00:31:10.666 --> 00:31:12.375
- What's your problem?
- It's okay.

00:31:12.458 --> 00:31:13.833
It's okay. She's my friend.

00:31:14.541 --> 00:31:15.583
Hi.

00:31:15.666 --> 00:31:17.250
You can speak Chinese.

00:31:17.333 --> 00:31:18.625
I had no idea.

00:31:18.708 --> 00:31:20.625
Don't get me wrong, I…

00:31:20.708 --> 00:31:24.000
I was having trouble explaining myself
and got a bit upset.

00:31:25.875 --> 00:31:27.375
- She's so mouthy!
- Excuse me.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.250
Pay her some respect.

00:31:29.333 --> 00:31:31.750
Does your manager know
you bad-mouth your guests?

00:31:32.375 --> 00:31:33.875
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

00:31:33.958 --> 00:31:35.750
We didn't mean any offense.

00:31:35.833 --> 00:31:37.125
Apologize to her.

00:31:38.125 --> 00:31:39.166
- We're sorry.
- Sorry.

00:31:39.250 --> 00:31:41.125
- We're so sorry.
- Sorry, miss.

00:31:42.833 --> 00:31:44.750
- What did you say to them?
- Not much.

00:31:44.833 --> 00:31:46.375
Just to be more polite to you.

00:31:47.833 --> 00:31:49.666
- Thank you.
- Let's go.

00:31:52.750 --> 00:31:54.333
Why did you want to see me?

00:31:55.083 --> 00:31:57.166
I just wanted to say thank you for today.

00:31:57.250 --> 00:31:59.041
This should cover the expenses.

00:31:59.708 --> 00:32:01.208
It's okay. It's on me.

00:32:01.291 --> 00:32:03.166
No, you have to accept this money.

00:32:03.250 --> 00:32:06.583
My elders taught me
never to be in debt to anyone.

00:32:07.583 --> 00:32:08.708
What a coincidence.

00:32:08.791 --> 00:32:11.875
My elders taught me
to be generous with ladies.

00:32:13.333 --> 00:32:16.125
It's really just spare change.
Don't let it bother you.

00:32:17.666 --> 00:32:19.125
You should still accept it.

00:32:21.041 --> 00:32:22.041
How about this?

00:32:22.916 --> 00:32:24.916
Use this money to treat me to coffee.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.208
Then we'll get to see each other again.

00:32:28.958 --> 00:32:32.291
I was going to ask you out
to dinner to say thanks anyway.

00:32:32.375 --> 00:32:34.000
- Are you free later?
- Tonight?

00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:38.541
I have to visit my grandmother tonight.

00:32:38.625 --> 00:32:39.625
She's in hospital.

00:32:40.958 --> 00:32:43.208
Would you mind if went with you?

00:32:44.625 --> 00:32:46.666
Not at all.
Are you sure you don't mind?

00:32:46.750 --> 00:32:48.208
I'm fine with it if you are.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.291
Okay.

00:32:50.375 --> 00:32:51.375
Let's go together.

00:32:55.333 --> 00:32:56.500
You're a good grandson.

00:32:58.375 --> 00:33:00.250
My parents split up when I was little.

00:33:00.333 --> 00:33:01.791
My grandmother raised me.

00:33:02.833 --> 00:33:04.708
Do you want something to eat?

00:33:04.791 --> 00:33:06.916
- No, I'm fine.
- Thanks for being here.

00:33:12.708 --> 00:33:13.541
What is it?

00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:17.666
Nothing, I was just thinking
you don't really look Chinese.

00:33:19.791 --> 00:33:20.666
Your face.

00:33:21.875 --> 00:33:26.000
My mom's Thai Chinese.
My dad's of mixed German and Thai descent.

00:33:27.125 --> 00:33:28.208
No wonder.

00:33:29.125 --> 00:33:30.625
What do they do?

00:33:32.875 --> 00:33:33.958
What about my family?

00:33:34.041 --> 00:33:36.458
Your dad is a Thai diplomat in Germany.

00:33:36.541 --> 00:33:38.333
Dad's a Thai diplomat in Germany.

00:33:38.416 --> 00:33:39.583
He died a few years ago.

00:33:39.666 --> 00:33:41.083
But he died a few years ago.

00:33:42.541 --> 00:33:43.625
Sorry.

00:33:45.250 --> 00:33:46.083
And your mom…

00:33:46.166 --> 00:33:48.291
- What about my mom?
- Your mom remarried.

00:33:48.375 --> 00:33:50.750
My stepdad runs a textile factory here.

00:33:50.833 --> 00:33:51.875
Supplying textiles…

00:33:51.958 --> 00:33:53.333
…and OEM for luxury brands.

00:33:53.416 --> 00:33:55.208
They don't have children.

00:33:55.291 --> 00:33:57.041
So Mom wants me to run the factory.

00:33:57.125 --> 00:33:58.000
But you're not…

00:33:58.083 --> 00:33:59.833
I'm not interested in business.

00:33:59.916 --> 00:34:01.541
What are you interested in?

00:34:01.625 --> 00:34:02.500
Photography.

00:34:02.583 --> 00:34:04.875
Photography? What kind?

00:34:04.958 --> 00:34:07.875
Mainly photos for fashion magazines.
And you plan to…

00:34:07.958 --> 00:34:09.750
…open a studio in Paris next year.

00:34:10.416 --> 00:34:11.708
Fashion, wow.

00:34:12.291 --> 00:34:13.458
I'm not fashion savvy.

00:34:14.291 --> 00:34:15.250
Liar.

00:34:15.333 --> 00:34:17.500
- You look like you are.
- Not really.

00:34:17.583 --> 00:34:19.250
Clearly not as much as you.

00:34:20.416 --> 00:34:23.750
I couldn't have done it
without my grandma's support.

00:34:24.333 --> 00:34:26.625
She means the world to me.

00:34:36.958 --> 00:34:37.791
What?

00:34:38.708 --> 00:34:39.583
Nothing.

00:34:42.541 --> 00:34:44.541
- You're going to Paris, right?
- Yeah.

00:34:44.625 --> 00:34:45.875
Can you speak French?

00:34:46.791 --> 00:34:49.291
No. But I can speak a little German.

00:34:49.375 --> 00:34:51.333
German? Right.

00:34:51.416 --> 00:34:52.458
Because of your dad.

00:34:53.166 --> 00:34:55.083
Can you say something in German?

00:34:57.666 --> 00:34:58.500
Sure.

00:35:02.666 --> 00:35:03.875
Du bist dumm.

00:35:05.166 --> 00:35:06.166
What does that mean?

00:35:07.458 --> 00:35:08.500
You're beautiful.

00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:48.333
What's wrong?

00:35:49.833 --> 00:35:50.833
I had a nightmare.

00:35:54.583 --> 00:35:55.625
What's on your mind?

00:35:58.208 --> 00:35:59.208
I'm wondering,

00:36:00.083 --> 00:36:02.291
why Chang Shih-kai

00:36:02.375 --> 00:36:04.125
didn't send me that video of Hsin-yi

00:36:04.791 --> 00:36:06.333
if he really wanted money?

00:36:08.625 --> 00:36:10.291
Didn't the police already say?

00:36:10.875 --> 00:36:13.500
He probably wanted to send it
but got arrested.

00:36:16.541 --> 00:36:17.541
At the time,

00:36:18.291 --> 00:36:20.375
if he'd asked for 40 million…

00:36:21.833 --> 00:36:23.125
I would've given it.

00:36:56.625 --> 00:36:58.000
Still at the association?

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:00.208
Did she really say that?

00:37:04.625 --> 00:37:06.416
We spent so much getting him out,

00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:08.208
and now we'll get nothing for him.

00:37:11.083 --> 00:37:12.333
If 40 million's too much,

00:37:12.958 --> 00:37:14.291
how about 20 million?

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:15.833
No?

00:37:18.083 --> 00:37:20.833
She doesn't believe I'll kill him?

00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:23.750
What did my mom say?

00:37:24.375 --> 00:37:26.750
- She can't get the money.
- Why the hell not?

00:37:26.833 --> 00:37:27.833
How should I know?

00:37:28.375 --> 00:37:29.458
You talk to him.

00:37:30.833 --> 00:37:31.666
Hello?

00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:35.083
Look, your mom says
she's being watched closely

00:37:35.166 --> 00:37:36.625
and can't access much money.

00:37:36.708 --> 00:37:39.375
She wants 10 days to half a month.

00:37:39.458 --> 00:37:42.458
No chance!
His mom will tell the cops to arrest us.

00:37:44.625 --> 00:37:45.500
Look.

00:37:46.125 --> 00:37:48.166
Your mom doesn't want to save you.

00:37:48.250 --> 00:37:50.250
All your money is hers now anyway.

00:37:50.958 --> 00:37:54.666
Whether you die once or twice
makes no difference to her.

00:37:56.125 --> 00:37:57.708
Do you know what crypto is?

00:37:58.875 --> 00:38:00.291
No, what's that?

00:38:01.583 --> 00:38:03.333
You've heard of Bitcoin, surely?

00:38:04.750 --> 00:38:08.416
Tell my mom to pay you
40 million in crypto.

00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:09.791
I know she can pay it.

00:38:09.875 --> 00:38:11.666
Too much hassle. We want cash.

00:38:12.916 --> 00:38:15.125
She really is being watched right now.

00:38:15.916 --> 00:38:18.458
Withdrawing cash
or moving funds will be tricky.

00:38:18.541 --> 00:38:19.916
You'll get eyes on you too.

00:38:20.791 --> 00:38:22.541
But that won't happen with crypto.

00:38:23.541 --> 00:38:24.583
It's very safe.

00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:26.500
So

00:38:27.208 --> 00:38:29.083
you hid all your money in…

00:38:29.166 --> 00:38:31.000
What's it called?

00:38:31.083 --> 00:38:32.250
Cryptocurrency?

00:38:34.625 --> 00:38:36.000
You're fishing for info!

00:38:39.291 --> 00:38:41.625
Anyway, just tell her to tell my mom that.

00:38:42.958 --> 00:38:44.166
Say what to your mom?

00:38:51.375 --> 00:38:52.375
What're you up to?

00:38:53.041 --> 00:38:54.625
What did my mom actually say?

00:38:55.166 --> 00:38:57.000
How would I know what she said?

00:38:57.083 --> 00:38:58.625
I went to pray.

00:38:58.708 --> 00:39:00.791
I joined the association
while I was there.

00:39:00.875 --> 00:39:02.500
I'm a fellow member now.

00:39:02.583 --> 00:39:04.375
Fuck you! You two are playing me!

00:39:04.833 --> 00:39:06.833
You think you're so clever, don't you?

00:39:06.916 --> 00:39:09.000
Did you even show her the video?

00:39:14.708 --> 00:39:17.916
You didn't send me
that video of Hsin-yi being tortured.

00:39:18.708 --> 00:39:20.458
I thought it was odd at the time.

00:39:20.958 --> 00:39:23.583
Didn't you record that video to get money?

00:39:23.666 --> 00:39:25.125
Why didn't you send it to me?

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:27.708
Now I finally understand.

00:39:28.708 --> 00:39:31.083
You wanted Hsin-yi to think

00:39:31.166 --> 00:39:35.291
that there was no one in this world
who could save her.

00:39:36.083 --> 00:39:38.041
Only once she had lost all hope

00:39:38.833 --> 00:39:40.750
could you truly control her.

00:39:42.916 --> 00:39:44.500
Do you understand now?

00:40:08.416 --> 00:40:10.625
{\an8}SANCHING TAI CHI ASSOCIATION

00:40:10.708 --> 00:40:12.333
{\an8}What does Wang Hui-chun want?

00:40:13.916 --> 00:40:15.291
She looked petrified.

00:40:16.833 --> 00:40:18.375
Did she really see him?

00:40:18.458 --> 00:40:19.541
What nonsense.

00:40:20.708 --> 00:40:22.416
There's no such thing as ghosts.

00:40:24.083 --> 00:40:25.416
Stop biting your nails.

00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:04.791
Is anyone there?

00:41:07.666 --> 00:41:08.791
Is anyone there?

00:42:37.833 --> 00:42:38.833
Are you insane?

00:42:38.916 --> 00:42:40.875
Why did you send me that video?

00:42:40.958 --> 00:42:44.875
We've confirmed that Chang Shih-kai
converted all his money into crypto.

00:42:44.958 --> 00:42:46.333
His mother has access to it.

00:42:46.416 --> 00:42:49.041
Possibly laundering it
through a tai chi association.

00:42:49.125 --> 00:42:52.416
If we can get more evidence,
we can give it to the court--

00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:54.750
You're still going on about civil damages?

00:42:55.750 --> 00:42:58.250
I don't care
how you resurrected Chang Shih-kai.

00:42:58.333 --> 00:43:01.208
It's a serious crime.
I want nothing to do with this case.

00:43:01.291 --> 00:43:04.125
Huang I-chen, we're in the same boat.

00:43:04.708 --> 00:43:07.708
Like it or not,
you have to see this through to the end.

00:43:07.791 --> 00:43:10.000
Who's in the same boat as you?

00:43:10.083 --> 00:43:12.916
You lost your husband and daughter.
I sympathize.

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:15.125
You want to self-destruct? I respect that.

00:43:15.208 --> 00:43:17.125
But keep me out of this.

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:20.291
The lawsuit
against Chang Shih-kai is over.

00:43:20.375 --> 00:43:23.666
From now on, let's go our separate ways.

00:43:23.750 --> 00:43:25.500
Don't contact me again, okay?

00:43:27.541 --> 00:43:28.958
And I even thought

00:43:30.333 --> 00:43:33.000
that if you were calling to offer help,

00:43:33.583 --> 00:43:36.500
our friendship could go back
to the way it was.

00:43:37.333 --> 00:43:38.416
What do you mean?

00:43:39.375 --> 00:43:40.916
I want you and An Chi

00:43:41.583 --> 00:43:44.708
to take the first flight
tomorrow to Benkha.

00:43:44.791 --> 00:43:45.791
Tomorrow?

00:43:46.541 --> 00:43:47.750
Are you kidding?

00:43:48.916 --> 00:43:49.750
You'll come.

00:43:53.916 --> 00:43:55.000
What does she...

00:44:02.333 --> 00:44:03.666
What did she mean?

00:44:14.166 --> 00:44:20.750
WANG HUI-CHUN
