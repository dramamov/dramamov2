00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:32.080
Who are you?

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:33.080
Who are you?

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:38.760
I’m asking, who are you?

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:40.480
Who are you?

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:44.880
Who the hell are you?

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:47.680
Who the hell are you?

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:55.280
Who am I?

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:23.960
What the hell is going on?

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:18.640
Shit!

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:20.200
Hey!

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:17.320
Bow to me.

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:21.920
Swallow me.

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:28.279
Come closer to me.

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:30.039
Your life is yours.

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:32.639
Ask your heart

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:35.600
if you want to taste me.

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:38.119
This man is mine.

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:39.720
That man is mine.

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:42.680
Look at the eyes of that young man.

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:44.920
Stop arguing with me already.

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:48.760
Are you afraid of me?

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:52.080
You’re afraid of me, aren’t you?

00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:57.559
You want to know, don’t you?

00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:59.120
Who am I?

00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:00.560
What do you say?

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:02.240
Iron?

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:07.640
Iron?

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:09.440
That’s right.

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:13.240
Iron, it’s your name.

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:16.480
My Iron.

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:20.920
Taiyo.

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:25.720
And you

00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:27.520
Marduk.

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:30.960
And you

00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:32.480
Copper.

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:37.200
And who are we?

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:39.440
What is this place?

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:41.040
What are we doing here?

00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:43.640
Oh dear.

00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:48.080
Do you want to know?

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:50.160
I won’t tell you.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.440
You humans are foolish and ignorant

00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:59.440
lost in your own sensitive emotions without direction.

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:02.239
You

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:05.240
are no different from beasts.

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:09.720
Beasts?

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:12.520
What are beasts?

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:14.680
What is this place?

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:17.000
And what the hell do you want?

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:19.800
And what do you think I want?

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:23.320
How pitiful!

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:26.200
You don’t even know your own life.

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:28.440
And how would I know?

00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:30.560
Am I right?

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:32.040
Iron?

00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:35.040
What do you say?

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:36.400
Taiyo?

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:40.520
Want to taste me again?

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:42.160
Marduk?

00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:44.280
Are you craving?

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:46.160
Copper?

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:51.360
Come on, give me a smile.

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:32.160
What are you doing?

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:32.800
Run!

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:33.760
Do you want to die?

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:34.120
Let’s go!

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:35.760
Let’s go!

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.000
Who are we?

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:38.520
And what is this place?

00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:41.200
What are we doing here?

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:45.400
Why are only four of us left?

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:48.240
Where did everyone else go?

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:55.640
Or maybe there are survivors behind that toxic fog.

00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:01.600
And what if there aren’t any?

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:07.560
Maybe everyone else on Earth has already died.

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:09.400
Who knows?

00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:11.640
Maybe the four of us are lucky

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:14.040
to be chosen to live.

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:17.240
Or unlucky

00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:20.320
that we’re not dead yet.

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:22.520
And don’t you want to know

00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:23.840
who we are?

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:28.160
Even if we knew, would it change anything?

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:30.200
No.

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:31.800
Then why do you want to know?

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:36.680
Knowing yourself

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:39.000
is better than not knowing.

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:42.440
I don’t think there’s anyone

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:44.760
who doesn’t want to know themselves.

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:48.160
Because at the very least

00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:51.240
we should know

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.000
who we are.

00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:57.000
Not without identity

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.200
without memories like this.

00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:03.520
Identity?

00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:05.080
What identity?

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:06.480
You are

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:08.760
stupid.

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:10.720
Everything is just made up.

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:12.120
How about this?

00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:13.920
Let’s suppose, I

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:16.320
am a great god.

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:18.120
And you guys

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:20.120
are my slaves.

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:22.200
Sounds good?

00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:23.040
Would you want that?

00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:23.920
Would you want that?

00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:25.440
That’s nonsense.

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:27.800
Nonsense? So what?

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:30.440
It’s still better than sitting here like an idiot

00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:31.920
holding onto that fruit.

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:34.920
Do you actually think it’ll get you out of here?

00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:38.800
How is what you’re doing any different from me?

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:40.160
Huh?

00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:43.040
Weird.

00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:46.120
Freaking weird.

00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:49.600
The more we wonder

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:51.000
the more we ask questions.

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:56.560
But we keep circling back to the same questions we’ve always wanted answers to.

00:19:57.160 --> 00:19:58.440
What exactly are the answers?

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:02.360
But we must have some memories left.

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:04.160
Memories that

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:07.000
are enough for us to know who we are

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:09.560
where we come from.

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:13.920
How is it possible that only the four of us remain on Earth?

00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:15.280
Why wouldn’t it be possible?

00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:18.720
Then that means only what you’re thinking

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:20.080
is possible?

00:20:20.081 --> 00:20:21.440
It doesn’t matter now.

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:24.800
What matter is how we will survive

00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:27.360
in this cruel world.

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:31.680
Then why do we have to live in this crappy world?

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:34.240
There’s nowhere else

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.080
more comfortable than this?

00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:38.640
If there is

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:40.520
why are we stuck here?

00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:43.120
You’re fucking stupid.

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:45.960
Why don’t we go see what’s out there first?

00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:48.360
What’s the point of arguing here?

00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:51.840
Then you go.

00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:53.560
Go ahead.

00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:54.920
Go die out there.

00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:56.840
Good idea actually.

00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:59.320
If one of us dies

00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:01.600
we’ll have something to eat.

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:03.400
Sounds good?

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:07.480
Why not?

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:09.200
I’m hungry.

00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:10.920
Or are you guys not hungry?

00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:43.400
I’m gonna go out there.

00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:47.160
Maybe I can find something we can eat.

00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:51.800
Hold up.

00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:54.800
I’ll go with you.

00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:03.080
No need.

00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:05.600
I can go by myself.

00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:09.280
Why?

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.000
Are you scared?

00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:33.640
Where do you think

00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:34.760
we’re going?

00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:37.320
No idea.

00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:41.760
Are we just gonna keep walking

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:43.440
without a destination like this?

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:46.639
So you think there is?

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:47.640
Destination?

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:52.640
I don’t know.

00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:07.560
Hey!

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:08.720
Hey!

00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:10.720
Are you okay?

00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:42.760
Eat up.

00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:53.800
Hey!

00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:55.200
What’s wrong?

00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:00.720
Are you okay?

00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:13.760
What?

00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:52.480
If we actually find food

00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:55.320
do we have to bring it back to share with those two?

00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:57.760
Yeah.

00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:00.840
Hot!

00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:34.800
Iron.

00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:52.720
Iron.

00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:56.160
Iron!

00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:14.120
We meet again, Iron.

00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:23.760
What’s all this?

00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:27.480
And who are you exactly?

00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:31.520
I really don’t understand.

00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:34.560
You humans

00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:39.520
are the most noble creatures

00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:45.119
but are always full of confusing questions and contradictions.

00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:48.200
And you shouldn’t ask anyone but yourself.

00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:53.040
But if knowing who I am

00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:57.240
will help you overcome your fate

00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:02.800
I’ll give you a chance to find out

00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:08.920
but first, you must overcome the rules I’ve created.

00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:11.200
What rules?

00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:18.599
They’re only as easy or as hard

00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:20.160
as you think they are.

00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:27.880
But for a foolish human like you, it shouldn’t be too much for your brain to handle.

00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:37.360
I don’t think this man is stupid.

00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:39.440
I like him.

00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:40.880
We’ll find out.

00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:46.280
I dare you to guess

00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:50.480
and ask me three questions.

00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:53.400
If your answers are wrong

00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:58.240
you’ll never know who I am.

00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:01.760
And you

00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:05.960
will fall into the darkness with no way out

00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:09.480
fall into karma

00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:13.680
and the cruel fate for the rest of your life.

00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:20.560
And what if I win?

00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:23.840
Then you’ll get what you want.

00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:29.760
Know what you want to know

00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:32.120
about me.

00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:34.240
Fine.

00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:38.080
Why did you agree so easily?

00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:41.439
There’s nothing you can trust at all.

00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:42.440
Stop it.

00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:55.200
Let’s begin.

00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:57.760
First question.

00:31:58.760 --> 00:31:59.800
I

00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:03.800
Am the first and the last

00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:10.760
who creates and destroys all life on Earth at once.

00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:16.160
No one or nothing

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:20.600
can escape me.

00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:23.360
What do you think I am?

00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:46.520
Air.

00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:52.240
See?

00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:54.960
I told you he isn’t stupid.

00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:58.560
Your chance has come.

00:32:58.800 --> 00:32:59.800
Iron.

00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:01.920
Go ahead.

00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:10.880
I am strong

00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:13.760
but sensitive.

00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:18.200
I can destroy anything

00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:22.400
but give life.

00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:41.480
Water.

00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:48.680
Your question is so easy, Iron.

00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:51.280
Second question.

00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:54.400
I

00:33:55.960 --> 00:34:01.360
Am the evil that exists in every molecule of this world.

00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:04.120
I’m invisible

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:07.640
causing pain

00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:12.000
and consuming every living thing

00:34:12.720 --> 00:34:15.400
whether they breathe or not.

00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:34.400
Germs.

00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:38.040
Germs.

00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:54.960
I give warmth

00:34:57.320 --> 00:34:58.560
shine bright

00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:01.400
burn

00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:04.480
destroy everything to ashes.

00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:11.000
Why is your question so easy?

00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:12.800
Iron

00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:16.640
I’m so disappointed in you.

00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:26.560
The sun.

00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:32.040
Last question.

00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:36.040
If your answer is wrong

00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:41.080
your chance is over.

00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:46.400
I

00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:50.200
Am the deepest darkness on Earth.

00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:54.720
I’ve been with you since birth.

00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:59.560
I am the last thing you’ll think of.

00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:05.440
I am a gift that every living thing on Earth will receive

00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:09.040
And no one

00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:11.360
can escape.

00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:24.040
What do you say, Iron?

00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:28.320
Are you giving up?

00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:47.960
Death.

00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:54.520
I

00:36:56.360 --> 00:36:57.920
Am the smallest thing

00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:04.920
and it’s still in me right now.

00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:19.920
No surprise a question like this comes from a human.

00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:22.840
Full of gaps

00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:24.640
and flaws.

00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:28.680
The answer is

00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:31.840
your identity.

00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:36.960
What do you say, Iron?

00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:40.440
Am I right?

00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:47.120
Is that the correct answer?

00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:50.560
My Iron.

00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:53.920
It’s hope, actually.

00:37:57.320 --> 00:37:58.320
Hope.

00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:03.640
Because I still have hope.

00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:10.560
If I have to die today

00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:12.840
at least

00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:14.760
I still get to hope

00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:18.360
to live

00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:21.880
and find the answers I seek

00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:27.800
understand what I’ve been facing all my life.

00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:29.960
Unlike you

00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:32.680
who pretend to be above fate

00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:36.120
always control it

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.360
but never had the chance to hope.

00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:47.960
Not even once.

00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:59.320
You, confident and arrogant human!

00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:03.640
I’ve defeated you.

00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:06.240
Now

00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:08.800
give me what I want.

00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:12.760
Absolutely.

00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:16.080
The fact is

00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:17.840
I am

00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:24.560
the chaos and the beginning of the universe.

00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:27.040
I

00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:33.560
Am the most powerful dictator in every situation.

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:36.960
Both humans and gods

00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:40.000
respect my power.

00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:41.600
I

00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:47.400
Am the only thing that influences everyone’s decision

00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:51.520
from the moment you first opened your eyes

00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:54.920
until the last moment

00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:57.960
of your breath.

00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:01.320
I

00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:06.720
Am something you can’t run from.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:10.000
I

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:12.600
Am certainty.

00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:15.560
I

00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:19.320
Am fate.

00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:32.040
Ananke.

00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:50.679
Have you noticed that those two have been acting strange?

00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:53.639
It’s like those two have feelings for each other.

00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:54.400
I

00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:55.400
Shouldn’t have told you.

00:40:55.401 --> 00:40:56.599
Better than making me look like an idiot

00:40:56.600 --> 00:40:57.839
keeping me in the dark.

00:40:57.840 --> 00:40:59.879
The weaker ones have to die.

00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:01.399
By die, I mean

00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:02.519
they just disappear from this world.

00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:03.520
Let go of me, damn it!
