00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:17.766
Keep it with you.

00:00:21.233 --> 00:00:22.599
If you need anything else...

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.766
I won't trouble you again.

00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:25.800
This is the last time.

00:00:31.433 --> 00:00:32.800
I dragged Wei into this.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.233
I'm sorry to you all.

00:00:41.566 --> 00:00:42.566
I'm sorry.

00:01:00.866 --> 00:01:02.366
We're both parents.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.600
Take good care of your son.

00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:11.066
Let's go.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.700
(Justice is Mine)

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.700
(Episode 14)

00:04:33.333 --> 00:04:34.533
- Mr. Qi.
- Mr. Qi.

00:04:35.833 --> 00:04:36.833
Qi Chang Rong!

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.632
Where did you take my children?

00:04:38.633 --> 00:04:40.633
Give me back my children!

00:04:43.566 --> 00:04:45.233
They are safe now.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.433
They're staying
in a five-star hotel.

00:04:48.233 --> 00:04:49.766
But if you go crazy,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.266
I can't guarantee anything.

00:04:51.733 --> 00:04:53.433
What do you want then?

00:04:53.866 --> 00:04:55.666
Do you want to kill me for revenge?

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.320
Don't think
I haven't thought about it.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.466
How dare you try to kill me?

00:05:06.666 --> 00:05:08.266
Too bad karma didn't find you.

00:05:08.866 --> 00:05:10.566
You didn't die.

00:05:12.366 --> 00:05:14.166
That's because I pray a lot.

00:05:40.533 --> 00:05:42.633
You'll get your retribution
sooner or later.

00:05:43.166 --> 00:05:44.766
Wei got his retribution.

00:05:47.666 --> 00:05:49.032
I'm showing you mercy.

00:05:49.033 --> 00:05:50.673
You can stay here
and reflect on yourself.

00:05:51.266 --> 00:05:52.600
Reflect until I'm satisfied.

00:05:53.233 --> 00:05:54.633
Then, I'll let you live.

00:05:54.833 --> 00:05:55.833
Understand?

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:59.800
Right.

00:05:59.966 --> 00:06:01.066
I forgot to tell you.

00:06:01.866 --> 00:06:03.066
This is a deserted island.

00:06:03.766 --> 00:06:05.400
Even if you can escape
through this door,

00:06:06.166 --> 00:06:08.200
you'll be shark food in the sea.

00:06:10.333 --> 00:06:11.799
As long as you behave,

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.800
your children will be
safe and healthy.

00:06:35.833 --> 00:06:37.232
Qi Chang Rong is here...

00:06:37.233 --> 00:06:38.865
to thank you for your blessings.

00:06:38.866 --> 00:06:40.033
I survived a disaster.

00:06:40.633 --> 00:06:42.765
Today, I'm offering a golden pig...

00:06:42.766 --> 00:06:43.866
to express my gratitude.

00:06:44.366 --> 00:06:46.465
Please continue
to give me your blessings.

00:06:46.466 --> 00:06:48.433
May the Old City Gang
prosper and thrive.

00:06:48.633 --> 00:06:49.832
May we stay powerful...

00:06:49.833 --> 00:06:50.933
and be in dominance.

00:06:55.866 --> 00:06:56.966
It's so lively here.

00:06:57.633 --> 00:06:58.633
Chang Rong.

00:06:58.933 --> 00:07:00.400
This is Councilor Huang Xiao.

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:02.600
He's here to visit
the Old City District.

00:07:04.766 --> 00:07:05.766
Welcome.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.066
Is crime in the Old City District
really that bad?

00:07:09.433 --> 00:07:12.533
Even if it is,
it's our own business.

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.733
There are many ways
to solve problems.

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.065
It's best to be harmonious.

00:07:18.066 --> 00:07:19.066
Harmony breeds wealth.

00:07:19.166 --> 00:07:20.166
Don't be silly.

00:07:20.733 --> 00:07:22.333
The most important thing
is to be fierce.

00:07:22.566 --> 00:07:24.366
If you're not fierce,
how can you be the boss?

00:07:24.433 --> 00:07:25.433
Mr. Qi.

00:07:25.566 --> 00:07:26.566
I heard that this injury...

00:07:26.567 --> 00:07:27.766
almost killed you.

00:07:28.866 --> 00:07:30.533
But as the saying goes,

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:32.240
great adversity brings good fortune.

00:07:33.866 --> 00:07:34.866
What do you mean by that?

00:07:34.966 --> 00:07:36.600
You're the boss
of the Old City Gang.

00:07:37.133 --> 00:07:39.600
If you head the development
of the Old City District,

00:07:40.333 --> 00:07:41.333
then...

00:07:41.366 --> 00:07:42.600
I'll be your good fortune.

00:07:44.133 --> 00:07:45.133
That's right.

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:47.133
I'm the boss of the Old City Gang.

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.665
But the biggest landowner
in the Old City District...

00:07:49.666 --> 00:07:50.766
is Granduncle Chen.

00:07:51.333 --> 00:07:52.933
If you try to take
even a brick from him,

00:07:53.066 --> 00:07:54.226
he'll fight you to the death.

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:56.466
Relying on those old folks
would be disastrous.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.666
They won't rebuild and innovate.

00:07:59.733 --> 00:08:01.832
The Old City District
is only so big.

00:08:01.833 --> 00:08:03.073
How many people can it support?

00:08:03.666 --> 00:08:05.865
If you don't tear it down
and start over,

00:08:05.866 --> 00:08:07.533
this pie won't get any bigger.

00:08:08.433 --> 00:08:10.766
Triads care
about profit division too.

00:08:12.066 --> 00:08:13.265
In this day and age,

00:08:13.266 --> 00:08:14.833
you can't just be
fighting and killing.

00:08:15.366 --> 00:08:16.366
Mr. Qi.

00:08:16.466 --> 00:08:17.866
You're a man of status.

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:19.532
You also want to do something...

00:08:19.533 --> 00:08:20.966
that's admirable, right?

00:08:24.466 --> 00:08:25.466
Mr. Qi.

00:08:25.866 --> 00:08:28.466
If we can change the land use
of the Old City District...

00:08:28.866 --> 00:08:29.965
and develop it...

00:08:29.966 --> 00:08:32.086
into a commercial, residential,
and entertainment hub,

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:34.832
then Mr. Qi,

00:08:34.833 --> 00:08:36.400
you'll be a real estate tycoon.

00:08:37.333 --> 00:08:38.693
It's better than using the land...

00:08:39.066 --> 00:08:40.733
to raise cows
and feed mosquitoes, right?

00:08:45.033 --> 00:08:46.166
It's not that I can't do it.

00:08:47.466 --> 00:08:48.733
It's impossible.

00:08:49.166 --> 00:08:50.606
I'm a part of the Old City District.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.565
If I betray the Old City District,

00:08:52.566 --> 00:08:54.066
I'd be a traitor.

00:08:56.666 --> 00:08:57.666
Well said.

00:08:58.366 --> 00:09:00.200
I like to be friends
with people like you...

00:09:00.566 --> 00:09:02.466
who value loyalty.

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.720
He's either at home
or at headquarters every day.

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:13.242
He has no activities
or social gatherings.

00:09:13.266 --> 00:09:14.633
But he has been busy lately.

00:09:14.966 --> 00:09:16.533
He visits the hospital twice a day.

00:09:17.566 --> 00:09:18.566
Who does he visit?

00:09:19.166 --> 00:09:20.565
A man from Tuncheng...

00:09:20.566 --> 00:09:21.665
who came for surgery.

00:09:21.666 --> 00:09:22.666
His name is Liu Mao.

00:09:23.966 --> 00:09:24.966
Liu Mao.

00:09:26.466 --> 00:09:27.832
Was the surgery successful?

00:09:27.833 --> 00:09:28.833
Is he dead?

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:30.632
No, the surgery was a success.

00:09:30.633 --> 00:09:31.666
Keep following him.

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:33.632
I want to know
how much information...

00:09:33.633 --> 00:09:35.133
Shi Zhi Yang has found.

00:09:35.333 --> 00:09:36.333
Okay.

00:09:36.866 --> 00:09:38.432
The surgery went better
than expected.

00:09:38.433 --> 00:09:39.833
He can get out of bed
in a few days.

00:09:40.266 --> 00:09:41.400
Thank you, Doctor.

00:09:45.466 --> 00:09:46.633
Congratulations, Liu Mao.

00:09:47.233 --> 00:09:48.665
You really look much better.

00:09:48.666 --> 00:09:50.032
Thank you, Stone,

00:09:50.033 --> 00:09:51.513
for persuading me
to have the surgery.

00:09:51.766 --> 00:09:52.766
Otherwise,

00:09:52.767 --> 00:09:54.200
I'd have died at home.

00:09:55.333 --> 00:09:57.333
I know you are truly repentant...

00:09:57.833 --> 00:09:59.365
since you're willing to seek justice
for the Huyan Wooden Shed Area.

00:09:59.366 --> 00:10:00.646
That's why luck is on your side.

00:10:02.166 --> 00:10:03.166
Liu Mao.

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:05.200
You're the only one
who knows the truth...

00:10:06.566 --> 00:10:08.086
regarding who paid you
to keep quiet...

00:10:08.333 --> 00:10:09.453
and who the real culprit is.

00:10:09.833 --> 00:10:11.733
So, you're an important witness.

00:10:13.266 --> 00:10:15.066
Are you willing to testify in court?

00:10:15.666 --> 00:10:16.666
But...

00:10:16.766 --> 00:10:17.932
I'm afraid I won't recognize them.

00:10:17.933 --> 00:10:18.933
It's all right.

00:10:19.133 --> 00:10:20.632
Just say what you remember.

00:10:20.633 --> 00:10:21.666
Let the judge decide.

00:10:23.266 --> 00:10:24.706
As long
as the verdict is overturned,

00:10:25.166 --> 00:10:26.599
the police will have
a justifiable reason...

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:27.880
to arrest the two real culprits,

00:10:28.633 --> 00:10:29.733
the tall man...

00:10:30.033 --> 00:10:31.033
and the foreigner
who had a middleman...

00:10:31.034 --> 00:10:32.433
pay you to keep quiet.

00:10:33.433 --> 00:10:34.433
All right.

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:39.200
Thank you.

00:11:15.266 --> 00:11:16.266
Hello.

00:11:16.266 --> 00:11:17.266
Hello, Xuan Xuan.

00:11:17.266 --> 00:11:18.266
I'm buying fruit.

00:11:18.466 --> 00:11:19.466
There's no need.

00:11:19.566 --> 00:11:20.800
My pipe burst at home.

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:22.200
I called a repairman.

00:11:22.566 --> 00:11:24.642
He said the whole wall
has to be demolished to fix it.

00:11:24.666 --> 00:11:26.066
So don't come over these few days.

00:11:27.233 --> 00:11:28.333
Then come to my place.

00:11:28.766 --> 00:11:30.365
I can't. I have
something to do tonight.

00:11:30.366 --> 00:11:31.366
I can't come.

00:11:32.366 --> 00:11:33.366
Is it about Liu Mao?

00:11:34.033 --> 00:11:35.799
That... can't be rushed.

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:37.133
Let's wait until he's better.

00:11:37.633 --> 00:11:38.932
Hey. I can't talk anymore.

00:11:38.933 --> 00:11:40.566
I have to get back to work. Bye.

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:02.433
What's wrong, Officer Da?

00:12:02.933 --> 00:12:04.200
You seem preoccupied today.

00:12:04.466 --> 00:12:05.632
Someone wants to reopen...

00:12:05.633 --> 00:12:07.166
the Huyan Wooden Shed Area case.

00:12:08.166 --> 00:12:09.400
Reopening an old case?

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:14.233
The Huyan Wooden Shed Area was
the first land development zone.

00:12:14.866 --> 00:12:16.432
We turned a wasteland...

00:12:16.433 --> 00:12:19.433
into today's booming gambling
and tourism district.

00:12:20.566 --> 00:12:21.966
The second phase is about to begin.

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:24.480
Once the Old City District
land acquisition is successful,

00:12:24.733 --> 00:12:26.133
I'll start construction right away.

00:12:26.666 --> 00:12:27.666
I'm confident...

00:12:27.966 --> 00:12:29.633
that I'll create...

00:12:29.933 --> 00:12:30.973
a second economic miracle.

00:12:34.233 --> 00:12:35.233
Officer Da.

00:12:36.033 --> 00:12:37.733
You were part of the first one.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.640
You'll be rewarded
for your contributions.

00:12:40.066 --> 00:12:42.833
If you want a share
in the second one,

00:12:43.666 --> 00:12:45.226
it'll depend
on how much you contribute.

00:12:46.233 --> 00:12:48.333
Just leave
the chaos and obstacles...

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:50.033
for me to clear.

00:12:52.433 --> 00:12:53.433
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

00:13:02.933 --> 00:13:04.999
Back then, Lyu Biao and I joined...

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.666
the Huyan arson case task force.

00:13:06.833 --> 00:13:07.833
Da Gama wasn't there,

00:13:08.533 --> 00:13:10.033
but Lyu Biao is good friends
with him.

00:13:10.766 --> 00:13:12.265
I heard Lyu Biu retired
a long time ago...

00:13:12.266 --> 00:13:13.633
and opened a sauna.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.166
Thank you, Mr. Peng.

00:13:29.066 --> 00:13:31.766
The number you have dialed
is temporarily unavailable.

00:13:32.233 --> 00:13:33.732
We've looked everywhere,
but we can't find him.

00:13:33.733 --> 00:13:34.832
Then where could he be?

00:13:34.833 --> 00:13:36.132
Your friend is missing.

00:13:36.133 --> 00:13:38.213
We searched the whole hospital
and couldn't find him.

00:14:02.433 --> 00:14:03.433
What is it?

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:06.200
Liu Mao is missing.

00:14:08.633 --> 00:14:10.200
I think I'll have to leave
for a while.

00:14:10.366 --> 00:14:11.366
Let's...

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:12.840
not contact each other for now.

00:14:13.366 --> 00:14:15.066
Don't get involved in this.

00:14:16.233 --> 00:14:17.266
Are they after you?

00:14:19.833 --> 00:14:21.433
Just watch out for Da Gama.

00:14:21.866 --> 00:14:23.799
If he really killed Liu Mao,

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:24.800
that means...

00:14:24.801 --> 00:14:26.200
anything could happen.

00:14:27.733 --> 00:14:28.733
What about you?

00:14:30.533 --> 00:14:31.966
I know another witness.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.299
If I can find him,

00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:35.300
I'm confident...

00:14:35.301 --> 00:14:36.566
I can catch Da Gama.

00:14:37.566 --> 00:14:38.733
Be careful.

00:14:39.233 --> 00:14:40.233
All right.

00:14:40.366 --> 00:14:41.366
Don't worry.

00:14:41.766 --> 00:14:43.433
I'll find you
when I'm done with this.

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:46.600
Go home.

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:53.933
Don't worry.

00:14:54.133 --> 00:14:55.565
I'm Shi Zhi Yang.

00:14:55.566 --> 00:14:56.866
Who would dare touch me?

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:02.800
Go home.

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:07.800
Call me.

00:15:07.933 --> 00:15:08.933
Okay.

00:15:27.166 --> 00:15:28.166
- Madam.
- Madam.

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:30.433
We brought back
all the hospital CCTV footage.

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:36.400
Madam.

00:15:36.466 --> 00:15:37.946
We're looking
at the CCTV footage now,

00:15:38.166 --> 00:15:39.365
but there's just too much.

00:15:39.366 --> 00:15:40.532
There are over 50 CCTVs...

00:15:40.533 --> 00:15:41.733
in the whole hospital.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.933
Yes, so we're really understaffed.

00:15:47.633 --> 00:15:48.713
Just keep watching for now.

00:15:49.266 --> 00:15:50.266
Yes, Madam.

00:16:04.266 --> 00:16:05.266
Lyu Biao.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.133
Miss, are you okay?

00:16:45.933 --> 00:16:46.933
Miss, are you okay?

00:16:48.233 --> 00:16:49.433
I'll take you to the hospital.

00:18:24.433 --> 00:18:25.433
Tang Xuan.

00:18:26.266 --> 00:18:27.432
Did you send someone
to the hospital...

00:18:27.433 --> 00:18:29.033
for their CCTV footage?

00:18:33.666 --> 00:18:34.666
Yes.

00:18:34.766 --> 00:18:37.366
Didn't you say Qin Yu had an alibi?

00:18:39.633 --> 00:18:40.633
Yes.

00:18:40.833 --> 00:18:42.273
Then why are you
still investigating?

00:18:42.933 --> 00:18:44.999
Can we not discuss this
at a time like this?

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.733
Why not?

00:18:46.866 --> 00:18:47.866
Madam.

00:18:48.166 --> 00:18:49.542
An officer was seriously injured...

00:18:49.566 --> 00:18:50.566
on Changyun Street.

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:52.600
Who?

00:18:52.766 --> 00:18:53.766
Officer Shi.

00:19:28.066 --> 00:19:29.066
The victim...

00:19:29.067 --> 00:19:30.799
was stabbed in the spleen
with a sharp object,

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:32.199
causing the aorta to rupture.

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:33.533
This led to massive bleeding.

00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:34.833
It could kill a person...

00:19:34.966 --> 00:19:36.166
in less than a minute.

00:20:35.533 --> 00:20:36.533
Tang Xuan.

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:46.200
Tang Xuan.

00:20:47.166 --> 00:20:48.166
I'm sorry for your loss.

00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:55.800
I want to take a look
at the crime scene.

00:21:07.833 --> 00:21:09.309
- Officer Hu.
- Where is the crime scene?

00:21:09.333 --> 00:21:10.333
Follow me.

00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:24.000
Did anyone see the killer?

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:25.833
A male suspect has been arrested.

00:21:26.733 --> 00:21:27.813
Which station is in charge?

00:21:28.533 --> 00:21:29.766
Headquarters has taken over.

00:21:34.833 --> 00:21:36.073
Why did you seal off his house?

00:21:36.566 --> 00:21:38.233
He's a victim, not a suspect.

00:21:38.533 --> 00:21:39.766
We're just following orders.

00:21:39.966 --> 00:21:41.406
Until the investigation is complete,

00:21:41.533 --> 00:21:43.233
no one is allowed to enter.

00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:45.399
- I'm going to take a look.
- Sorry, Madam.

00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:46.400
- Let me take a look!
- Tang Xuan!

00:21:46.401 --> 00:21:47.532
- Please don't disrupt us.
- Let me in!

00:21:47.533 --> 00:21:48.732
- Madam!
- Tang Xuan!

00:21:48.733 --> 00:21:50.732
- Why won't you let me in?
- Tang Xuan!

00:21:50.733 --> 00:21:52.366
Tang Xuan! Calm down!

00:21:53.566 --> 00:21:54.566
Calm down.

00:21:56.933 --> 00:21:57.933
Okay.

00:22:04.366 --> 00:22:05.366
Here.

00:22:05.933 --> 00:22:07.032
Only on a full stomach...

00:22:07.033 --> 00:22:08.473
will you have the strength to fight.

00:22:11.466 --> 00:22:13.666
What was Shi Zhi Yang doing?

00:22:16.666 --> 00:22:18.266
Do you know something?

00:22:19.833 --> 00:22:21.593
Did you expect something
would happen to him?

00:22:26.666 --> 00:22:27.666
It's my friend.

00:22:30.633 --> 00:22:32.166
Hello, Cong. What's up?

00:22:37.233 --> 00:22:38.433
Okay. Thank you, Cong.

00:22:39.033 --> 00:22:40.033
I'll call you back.

00:22:41.166 --> 00:22:42.166
Tang Xuan.

00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:45.400
Calm down and listen to me.

00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:47.233
My friend read the statement.

00:22:48.133 --> 00:22:49.232
He said that the suspect...

00:22:49.233 --> 00:22:50.233
is a drug dealer.

00:22:50.533 --> 00:22:51.533
When he was arrested,

00:22:51.534 --> 00:22:53.133
they found a murder weapon on him.

00:22:53.333 --> 00:22:54.833
After the preliminary examination,

00:22:55.733 --> 00:22:56.999
the fatal wound...

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.765
on Shi Zhi Yang's body...

00:22:58.766 --> 00:22:59.766
matches the weapon.

00:23:00.566 --> 00:23:02.333
And according
to the suspect's statement,

00:23:02.933 --> 00:23:05.565
he got into a conflict
with Shi Zhi Yang...

00:23:05.566 --> 00:23:06.632
over dividing the spoils.

00:23:06.633 --> 00:23:08.800
That's why he accidentally
killed him.

00:23:11.166 --> 00:23:12.166
What?

00:23:13.133 --> 00:23:14.400
Did I hear that right?

00:23:16.033 --> 00:23:18.232
How could they say
such a ridiculous thing?

00:23:18.233 --> 00:23:20.366
I don't believe it either, but...

00:23:20.433 --> 00:23:22.132
I know it's incredibly hard...

00:23:22.133 --> 00:23:24.166
to keep it to yourself right now.

00:23:24.633 --> 00:23:26.233
But let me
tell you this, Tang Xuan.

00:23:27.566 --> 00:23:29.399
You have to calm down...

00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:30.733
to solve this.

00:23:31.833 --> 00:23:32.833
Okay?

00:23:34.566 --> 00:23:35.566
Come.

00:23:35.833 --> 00:23:36.866
Take care of your sister.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:50.000
Tang Xuan.

00:23:54.366 --> 00:23:55.366
Tang Xuan.

00:23:57.566 --> 00:23:58.566
Tang Xuan.

00:24:14.066 --> 00:24:15.633
I just got this case.

00:24:15.866 --> 00:24:17.366
I've read the indictment.

00:24:17.666 --> 00:24:19.186
There's enough evidence
to lay charges.

00:24:19.366 --> 00:24:20.800
You're the best judge for this.

00:24:22.133 --> 00:24:24.233
Do you have
any special instructions for me?

00:24:25.166 --> 00:24:26.400
I wouldn't dare.

00:24:26.833 --> 00:24:27.933
If I say one more word,

00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:30.666
I'm afraid I'd be
obstructing justice.

00:24:31.066 --> 00:24:32.506
You're more experienced than I am...

00:24:32.533 --> 00:24:34.200
in these matters.

00:24:35.466 --> 00:24:36.632
The whole city...

00:24:36.633 --> 00:24:37.633
is watching this case.

00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:39.433
It's the best way
to repair your image.

00:24:39.666 --> 00:24:40.966
Seize this opportunity.

00:24:53.733 --> 00:24:54.733
By the way,

00:24:54.933 --> 00:24:55.966
the suspect...

00:24:56.133 --> 00:24:58.166
also confessed to Han Gang's murder.

00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:00.420
(Han Gang's murder in the church
was also my doing...)

00:25:03.666 --> 00:25:04.666
Is there a problem?

00:25:07.133 --> 00:25:08.133
No.

00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:16.100
Judge Qin.

00:25:16.266 --> 00:25:17.733
Councilor Huang is here to see you.

00:25:18.333 --> 00:25:19.600
Judge Qin, I'm sorry.

00:25:19.933 --> 00:25:21.133
I didn't make an appointment.

00:25:21.333 --> 00:25:22.566
I hope I'm not bothering you.

00:25:23.666 --> 00:25:24.666
Let's talk inside.

00:25:24.766 --> 00:25:25.766
Okay.

00:25:48.833 --> 00:25:50.966
I took care of Han Lie for you,

00:25:51.533 --> 00:25:53.733
but it looks like
this inspector is still after you.

00:25:56.233 --> 00:25:57.233
She's persistent.

00:25:57.333 --> 00:25:58.400
That's her strength.

00:25:59.066 --> 00:26:00.066
To prosecute,

00:26:00.466 --> 00:26:01.532
you need evidence.

00:26:01.533 --> 00:26:03.332
But I think if we can solve...

00:26:03.333 --> 00:26:05.400
all problems with just one case,

00:26:05.633 --> 00:26:07.533
we can save a lot
of unnecessary trouble.

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:10.600
If the sentence for manslaughter...

00:26:10.766 --> 00:26:11.766
and drug trafficking...

00:26:11.966 --> 00:26:13.400
are served concurrently,

00:26:13.766 --> 00:26:15.233
Shi Zhi Yang's case...

00:26:15.666 --> 00:26:17.706
won't have a maximum sentence
of more than 15 years.

00:26:18.566 --> 00:26:20.366
But Han Gang's case is murder.

00:26:21.566 --> 00:26:24.033
The maximum sentence is 25 years.

00:26:25.333 --> 00:26:28.200
Is it because your son
is currently in prison...

00:26:28.233 --> 00:26:29.865
that you're so sympathetic...

00:26:29.866 --> 00:26:31.000
to those inmates?

00:26:32.533 --> 00:26:34.332
Actually, 25 years and 25 months...

00:26:34.333 --> 00:26:35.333
are the same.

00:26:35.866 --> 00:26:37.433
It's their choice.

00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:39.800
Likewise,

00:26:40.733 --> 00:26:42.266
it's your choice too.

00:26:44.266 --> 00:26:45.466
I'll let you get back to work.

00:27:00.433 --> 00:27:01.433
Tang Xuan?

00:27:01.666 --> 00:27:03.165
Shi Zhi Yang's girlfriend?

00:27:03.166 --> 00:27:04.166
What do you think?

00:27:04.233 --> 00:27:05.566
She's Hu Jian's apprentice.

00:27:06.333 --> 00:27:07.933
She's very stubborn.

00:27:08.033 --> 00:27:09.273
She won't budge no matter what.

00:27:10.366 --> 00:27:11.646
How much do you think she knows?

00:27:12.366 --> 00:27:13.466
Based on her personality,

00:27:13.766 --> 00:27:14.966
if she knew,

00:27:15.233 --> 00:27:16.333
she'd blow the whistle.

00:27:16.633 --> 00:27:17.713
She wouldn't be this quiet.

00:27:19.666 --> 00:27:21.033
Until this case is over,

00:27:22.066 --> 00:27:23.433
it's better to be safe.

00:27:25.533 --> 00:27:27.532
After Shi Zhi Yang's case,

00:27:27.533 --> 00:27:28.733
you've been on vacation.

00:27:29.233 --> 00:27:31.366
It's time to go back to work.

00:27:36.333 --> 00:27:38.532
It's rumored that the senior
police officer who was killed...

00:27:38.533 --> 00:27:40.142
was in a dispute over uneven profits
with a drug dealer.

00:27:40.166 --> 00:27:41.566
What do you have to say about that?

00:27:41.833 --> 00:27:44.200
The case has entered
the judicial process.

00:27:44.566 --> 00:27:46.933
I cannot make any comments
during this time.

00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:50.099
But the police force
enforces the law.

00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:51.100
For a long time,

00:27:51.101 --> 00:27:52.765
we've followed
the rules of integrity.

00:27:52.766 --> 00:27:54.933
We've upheld
the core values of justice.

00:27:55.133 --> 00:27:57.293
We do not tolerate anyone
who breaks the law knowingly.

00:27:58.566 --> 00:28:00.366
This monster is pretending
to be righteous.

00:28:01.733 --> 00:28:02.973
Can you stand listening to him?

00:28:08.533 --> 00:28:09.666
Then tell me.

00:28:10.166 --> 00:28:11.433
What's the truth?

00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:14.142
Da Gama killed Shi Zhi Yang
to shut him up...

00:28:14.166 --> 00:28:15.232
and then, he framed him!

00:28:15.233 --> 00:28:16.265
That's the truth!

00:28:16.266 --> 00:28:17.865
Da Gama is the Chief Superintendent.

00:28:17.866 --> 00:28:19.933
Your accusation is very serious.

00:28:26.433 --> 00:28:28.033
He's already dead.

00:28:30.333 --> 00:28:31.766
Why are they still accusing him?

00:28:38.133 --> 00:28:39.533
Boss. Madam.

00:28:40.166 --> 00:28:41.565
Officer Gu
from Internal Investigations...

00:28:41.566 --> 00:28:42.733
wants to see you.

00:28:44.533 --> 00:28:46.433
I'm sorry. What's the reason
this time?

00:28:47.233 --> 00:28:48.365
We found a handbag...

00:28:48.366 --> 00:28:49.366
in Shi Zhi Yang's house.

00:28:49.367 --> 00:28:50.532
It belongs to Inspector Tang.

00:28:50.533 --> 00:28:52.166
We found some drugs in it.

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:54.999
- Drugs?
- We've confirmed that the drugs...

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:56.000
How many more people
do you want to frame?

00:28:56.001 --> 00:28:57.565
Are part of the same batch...

00:28:57.566 --> 00:28:59.733
of the ones
found on Shi Zhi Yang's killer.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.165
So we want to bring
Inspector Tang back...

00:29:01.166 --> 00:29:02.406
to assist in the investigation.

00:29:02.566 --> 00:29:03.609
This is the arrest warrant.

00:29:03.633 --> 00:29:05.132
It's a direct order
from headquarters.

00:29:05.133 --> 00:29:06.400
We're just following orders.

00:29:06.933 --> 00:29:08.266
We'll cooperate fully.

00:29:08.966 --> 00:29:10.486
But don't make things
difficult for us.

00:29:28.166 --> 00:29:30.200
Do you want
to handcuff me, Officer Gu?

00:29:42.566 --> 00:29:45.033
Why did you hide
your relationship with Shi Zhi Yang?

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.666
Who I date is my privacy.

00:29:54.233 --> 00:29:56.066
What law says I have to disclose it?

00:29:56.933 --> 00:29:58.165
We found your handbag...

00:29:58.166 --> 00:29:59.232
at Shi Zhi Yang's house.

00:29:59.233 --> 00:30:00.632
We found drugs and money in it.

00:30:00.633 --> 00:30:01.633
How do you explain that?

00:30:02.833 --> 00:30:04.033
I've told you many times.

00:30:05.133 --> 00:30:06.366
That bag is mine,

00:30:06.933 --> 00:30:09.233
but none of the things inside
are mine.

00:30:11.633 --> 00:30:12.713
Let her hear the statement.

00:30:15.533 --> 00:30:16.832
Han Kui Long is in jail,

00:30:16.833 --> 00:30:18.609
and Han Lie hasn't been
managing the business well.

00:30:18.633 --> 00:30:19.665
Shi Zhi Yang...

00:30:19.666 --> 00:30:21.365
used his intel
from the Intelligence Bureau...

00:30:21.366 --> 00:30:22.966
to steal a lot
of the Han family's goods.

00:30:23.566 --> 00:30:25.533
Later, when he found out
Han Gang woke up,

00:30:26.033 --> 00:30:27.433
he forced me to kill Han Gang.

00:30:27.766 --> 00:30:28.846
He wanted the Han family...

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.233
to be doomed forever.

00:30:32.533 --> 00:30:34.333
What does this have to do
with Han Gang?

00:30:34.933 --> 00:30:36.365
Don't you think
you're being ridiculous?

00:30:36.366 --> 00:30:37.833
I'll have to ask you that.

00:30:41.033 --> 00:30:42.399
If you don't cooperate,

00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:43.632
I'll keep asking...

00:30:43.633 --> 00:30:45.033
until I get an answer.

00:30:49.833 --> 00:30:50.833
Does the prosecution...

00:30:51.066 --> 00:30:53.333
have any additional evidence
to bring forward?

00:30:53.433 --> 00:30:54.433
Your Honor.

00:30:54.833 --> 00:30:57.166
This is the prosecution's
latest evidence.

00:30:58.966 --> 00:31:00.733
How is it different from last time?

00:31:00.866 --> 00:31:02.633
The police investigated further.

00:31:02.966 --> 00:31:05.176
They found that the defendant
is related to the Old City District.

00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:07.120
The prosecution has taken
several new statements.

00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:08.400
They're on page five.

00:31:09.833 --> 00:31:12.133
Shi Zhi Yang's case
has gone to trial.

00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:15.333
We're giving you
a chance to confess now.

00:31:15.733 --> 00:31:16.733
If you don't take it,

00:31:17.033 --> 00:31:18.433
you'll regret it.

00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:20.400
I've looked at the evidence.

00:31:20.833 --> 00:31:22.393
Does the defendant
have anything to add?

00:31:22.566 --> 00:31:23.566
Your Honor.

00:31:23.866 --> 00:31:25.032
My client would like...

00:31:25.033 --> 00:31:26.709
to personally present
the background of the case.

00:31:26.733 --> 00:31:28.466
I believe it's important
for the sentencing.

00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:29.700
Please allow it.

00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:30.800
Granted.

00:31:38.066 --> 00:31:39.066
Your Honor.

00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:40.633
I didn't mean to kill him.

00:31:41.533 --> 00:31:42.693
He forced me to kill someone.

00:31:42.766 --> 00:31:43.832
He even forced me to pay him...

00:31:43.833 --> 00:31:44.932
and give him the goods.

00:31:44.933 --> 00:31:46.065
He was a cop,

00:31:46.066 --> 00:31:47.066
and he was high-ranked too.

00:31:47.067 --> 00:31:48.933
He really cornered me.

00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:53.800
It was really him.

00:31:58.933 --> 00:32:00.132
And that day,

00:32:00.133 --> 00:32:01.932
when I said
I wanted to end our partnership,

00:32:01.933 --> 00:32:03.333
he immediately turned on me.

00:32:03.633 --> 00:32:05.073
He said he'd arrest me for murder...

00:32:05.266 --> 00:32:06.799
and drug trafficking.

00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:08.465
That's burning bridges!

00:32:08.466 --> 00:32:09.532
I was scared.

00:32:09.533 --> 00:32:10.933
I was forced to fight back.

00:32:11.533 --> 00:32:12.533
Stop pretending.

00:32:13.066 --> 00:32:14.706
Given your relationship
with Shi Zhi Yang,

00:32:15.033 --> 00:32:16.732
you were already
in cahoots with him.

00:32:16.733 --> 00:32:17.733
Isn't that right?

00:32:25.033 --> 00:32:26.233
He had a gun.

00:32:26.833 --> 00:32:28.473
I had a knife in my hand
to defend myself.

00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:29.932
I didn't expect...

00:32:29.933 --> 00:32:31.065
that I'd accidentally stab him...

00:32:31.066 --> 00:32:32.265
when we were fighting.

00:32:32.266 --> 00:32:33.986
Your Honor, I truly
didn't mean to kill him.

00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:39.800
Prosecutor.

00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:41.433
Do you have anything to add?

00:32:42.333 --> 00:32:43.333
No, Your Honor.

00:32:50.933 --> 00:32:51.933
Have some water.

00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:53.832
The evidence confirms...

00:32:53.833 --> 00:32:54.993
that Shi Zhi Yang was bribed.

00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:57.333
Besides, he's dead now.

00:32:57.933 --> 00:32:59.133
It's not worth it...

00:32:59.333 --> 00:33:00.333
to take the fall for him.

00:33:03.466 --> 00:33:04.586
The evidence in this case...

00:33:04.733 --> 00:33:05.766
is very coherent.

00:33:06.866 --> 00:33:08.409
The prosecution
has brought two charges,

00:33:08.433 --> 00:33:09.799
the manslaughter of Shi Zhi Yang...

00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:12.200
and the murder of Han Gang.

00:33:12.533 --> 00:33:14.653
The defendant has also confessed
to these two charges.

00:33:14.933 --> 00:33:16.833
Considering that the defendant...

00:33:17.166 --> 00:33:19.442
was threatened by a police officer
at the time of the crime,

00:33:19.466 --> 00:33:22.766
according to Article 128
of the Criminal Code,

00:33:23.666 --> 00:33:24.932
the defendant is sentenced...

00:33:24.933 --> 00:33:26.733
to 12 years in prison.

00:33:27.533 --> 00:33:28.533
Furthermore,

00:33:28.633 --> 00:33:31.333
the police officer involved
in this case, Shi Zhi Yang,

00:33:32.766 --> 00:33:35.466
abused his authority
to commit crimes.

00:33:35.766 --> 00:33:36.866
The evidence is valid.

00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:39.333
However, he is dead.

00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:41.760
According
to the applicable regulations,

00:33:42.166 --> 00:33:43.833
he will not be held liable.

00:33:45.566 --> 00:33:46.566
Court is adjourned.

00:33:58.266 --> 00:34:00.266
Officer Hu, you have 15 minutes.

00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:02.400
Thank you.

00:34:13.333 --> 00:34:14.333
How are you?

00:34:20.966 --> 00:34:22.833
Shi Zhi Yang's case
has been ruled on.

00:34:23.833 --> 00:34:25.600
The murderer was sentenced
to 12 years.

00:34:26.333 --> 00:34:27.333
Shi Zhi Yang...

00:34:27.334 --> 00:34:28.465
He used his authority...

00:34:28.466 --> 00:34:30.133
to commit crimes.

00:34:35.533 --> 00:34:36.533
Hey.

00:34:45.666 --> 00:34:47.166
Do you believe he was a corrupt cop?

00:34:49.533 --> 00:34:50.533
Does it matter?

00:34:51.666 --> 00:34:52.999
The most important thing now...

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:54.866
is to get you out of here.

00:34:57.200 --> 00:34:58.200
Out?

00:35:01.766 --> 00:35:03.566
If I get out, will I still be a cop?

00:35:05.133 --> 00:35:06.213
What's the matter with you?

00:35:07.466 --> 00:35:09.000
The Tang Xuan I know...

00:35:10.433 --> 00:35:11.999
wouldn't be like this.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.400
She would never give up.

00:35:20.733 --> 00:35:21.733
Whose interests...

00:35:21.734 --> 00:35:24.166
did Shi Zhi Yang violate?

00:35:28.033 --> 00:35:29.033
Da Gama?

00:35:31.533 --> 00:35:32.933
He found out that Da Gama...

00:35:34.233 --> 00:35:35.833
obstructed justice...

00:35:37.233 --> 00:35:38.566
in an arson case.

00:35:39.633 --> 00:35:40.666
Is there any evidence?

00:35:45.733 --> 00:35:46.933
There was a witness before.

00:35:48.733 --> 00:35:49.733
He disappeared.

00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:53.733
They probably killed him too.

00:35:58.233 --> 00:36:00.132
If so much manpower...

00:36:00.133 --> 00:36:01.433
and resources were used...

00:36:01.733 --> 00:36:02.999
to destroy the evidence,

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:04.365
it means Da Gama...

00:36:04.366 --> 00:36:05.933
is very wary of this.

00:36:07.333 --> 00:36:08.600
If that's the case,

00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:10.866
let's use this...

00:36:11.666 --> 00:36:13.166
to make a bet with Da Gama.

00:36:17.133 --> 00:36:18.133
In exchange for what?

00:36:18.333 --> 00:36:19.633
For getting you out of here.

00:36:20.933 --> 00:36:22.232
Do you like staying here...

00:36:22.233 --> 00:36:23.333
so he can torture you?

00:36:46.433 --> 00:36:47.433
Happy!

00:36:47.434 --> 00:36:48.833
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

00:36:51.566 --> 00:36:52.566
Come here!

00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:53.732
- Come on.
- Come on.

00:36:53.733 --> 00:36:54.865
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

00:36:54.866 --> 00:36:56.233
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

00:36:59.633 --> 00:37:00.765
Do you want to eat something?

00:37:00.766 --> 00:37:01.766
I'm bloated from drinking.

00:37:01.766 --> 00:37:02.766
Drink some more.

00:37:05.466 --> 00:37:06.466
Officer Hu.

00:37:07.266 --> 00:37:08.333
It's so lively.

00:37:09.366 --> 00:37:10.366
Officer Da.

00:37:10.466 --> 00:37:12.233
What are you celebrating?

00:37:12.733 --> 00:37:14.333
It's rare to see you here, Hu Jian.

00:37:14.733 --> 00:37:15.865
What are you doing here?

00:37:15.866 --> 00:37:17.366
Should you report to your wife?

00:37:18.033 --> 00:37:20.733
Otherwise, you'll have to kneel
before her when you get home.

00:37:23.433 --> 00:37:24.433
Officer Da.

00:37:24.733 --> 00:37:26.800
I want to talk to you in private.

00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:30.499
There's nothing they can't hear.

00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:31.500
You can talk...

00:37:31.501 --> 00:37:32.533
while I flirt.

00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:36.233
I'll be bringing up your misdeeds.

00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:40.566
If you don't mind, I don't either.

00:37:41.333 --> 00:37:42.466
What did you say?

00:37:46.333 --> 00:37:47.333
You flirt.

00:37:48.233 --> 00:37:49.233
I'll talk.

00:37:49.666 --> 00:37:51.433
Just don't regret it.

00:37:53.933 --> 00:37:54.933
Go.

00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:56.200
Everyone, let's go.

00:37:56.201 --> 00:37:57.441
Let's go play in the next room.

00:38:01.166 --> 00:38:02.532
Don't try this again.

00:38:02.533 --> 00:38:03.533
Just spit it out.

00:38:04.666 --> 00:38:06.600
Tang Xuan told me...

00:38:07.533 --> 00:38:10.665
that Shi Zhi Yang
gave a secret file...

00:38:10.666 --> 00:38:12.600
to a lawyer friend before he died.

00:38:14.133 --> 00:38:16.466
I found this lawyer today.

00:38:16.966 --> 00:38:17.966
I told him...

00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:20.232
that Shi Zhi Yang...

00:38:20.233 --> 00:38:21.966
has been classified
as a corrupt cop.

00:38:22.533 --> 00:38:23.866
All his belongings...

00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:26.366
could be related to a serious crime.

00:38:26.866 --> 00:38:28.599
If he keeps them to himself,

00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:31.133
he'll be considered an accomplice.

00:38:31.933 --> 00:38:32.933
As soon as he heard it,

00:38:33.433 --> 00:38:34.433
he was very scared.

00:38:34.733 --> 00:38:35.999
He gave me...

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.000
the secret file on his own accord.

00:38:41.166 --> 00:38:42.166
Where is it?

00:38:46.933 --> 00:38:47.933
Show it to me.

00:38:48.233 --> 00:38:49.233
There's no rush.

00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:53.666
Are you trying
to make a deal with me?

00:38:54.266 --> 00:38:56.265
Remember when we were partners?

00:38:56.266 --> 00:38:57.466
You used to say...

00:38:58.133 --> 00:38:59.973
that it doesn't matter
how many chips you have.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.166
What's important
is that you bet right.

00:39:06.333 --> 00:39:08.599
If you had listened to me back then,

00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:11.233
you'd at least
be a superintendent today.

00:39:13.733 --> 00:39:14.733
It's all in the past.

00:39:14.734 --> 00:39:16.466
There's no point
talking about it now.

00:39:17.233 --> 00:39:18.766
So I choose to look ahead now.

00:39:21.333 --> 00:39:22.866
Today, I've decided...

00:39:24.233 --> 00:39:26.333
to bet this chip on you.

00:39:27.266 --> 00:39:28.533
What exactly do you want?

00:39:29.933 --> 00:39:31.665
There were so many things...

00:39:31.666 --> 00:39:32.666
I couldn't figure out before.

00:39:32.667 --> 00:39:33.965
Now, I realize...

00:39:33.966 --> 00:39:35.433
that they're not important at all.

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:37.080
The most important thing...

00:39:37.466 --> 00:39:39.133
is practical gain.

00:39:41.633 --> 00:39:43.600
So how much
are you planning to win...

00:39:44.333 --> 00:39:45.333
with this chip?

00:39:45.334 --> 00:39:46.400
To be honest,

00:39:47.733 --> 00:39:49.332
I have no idea if this contains...

00:39:49.333 --> 00:39:51.933
very damaging evidence,

00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:53.532
or if it'll just end up being
scrap paper...

00:39:53.533 --> 00:39:55.966
that you'll throw
in the trash after reading.

00:39:56.233 --> 00:39:57.233
But here's what I think.

00:39:57.800 --> 00:39:59.033
Shi Zhi Yang's case...

00:39:59.366 --> 00:40:00.966
has been ruled on,

00:40:01.333 --> 00:40:03.165
and Tang Xuan has told me...

00:40:03.166 --> 00:40:04.566
everything she knows.

00:40:05.133 --> 00:40:07.533
If this document is really useful,

00:40:07.833 --> 00:40:09.333
give Tang Xuan back to me.

00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:11.133
It's not too much to ask, right?

00:40:19.666 --> 00:40:22.199
Our Eastern District's
clear-up rate is so high...

00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:24.432
because my subordinates are capable,

00:40:24.433 --> 00:40:25.533
especially Tang Xuan.

00:40:25.966 --> 00:40:28.465
She's the only one
who can control those gangsters...

00:40:28.466 --> 00:40:29.466
and scoundrels.

00:40:30.333 --> 00:40:31.333
Besides,

00:40:31.666 --> 00:40:34.832
Shi Zhi Yang sent
this secret document...

00:40:34.833 --> 00:40:36.266
to his lawyer...

00:40:36.533 --> 00:40:38.233
than give it to Tang Xuan.

00:40:39.033 --> 00:40:40.033
That means...

00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:42.966
he didn't want Tang Xuan...

00:40:43.533 --> 00:40:44.866
to know too much.

00:40:50.733 --> 00:40:51.733
I accept.

00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:17.800
Some things...

00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:19.366
are disposable.

00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:20.920
There's no point in keeping them.

00:41:35.933 --> 00:41:37.433
I drove your car here.

00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:43.600
Officer Hu.

00:41:44.333 --> 00:41:45.333
Thank you.

00:41:45.966 --> 00:41:47.566
I'll allow you
to take a few days off.

00:41:48.166 --> 00:41:49.233
Get some rest.

00:41:50.566 --> 00:41:51.566
There's no need.

00:41:52.333 --> 00:41:53.533
I'll go back to work tomorrow.

00:41:54.666 --> 00:41:55.666
Right now,

00:41:56.133 --> 00:41:57.633
I'm going to Shi Zhi Yang's house.

00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:00.766
Tang Xuan, let it go.

00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:02.665
You're safe this time...

00:42:02.666 --> 00:42:03.766
because I was lucky.

00:42:04.033 --> 00:42:05.232
If this happens again,

00:42:05.233 --> 00:42:06.833
I might not be so lucky.

00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:08.932
Shi Zhi Yang refused to give in.

00:42:08.933 --> 00:42:10.600
That's why he got himself killed.

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:18.000
Officer Hu.

00:42:19.366 --> 00:42:21.533
A cop's innocence is at stake.

00:42:25.166 --> 00:42:26.633
If you were that cop,

00:42:28.266 --> 00:42:29.533
what would you want me to do?

00:42:33.033 --> 00:42:34.366
So, I beg you.

00:42:36.433 --> 00:42:37.433
Don't try to persuade me.

00:45:12.666 --> 00:45:16.166
Hello, darkness, my old friend

00:45:18.333 --> 00:45:21.533
I've come to talk with you again

00:45:24.133 --> 00:45:29.200
Because the vision softly creeping

00:45:30.366 --> 00:45:35.233
Left its seeds while I was sleeping

00:45:36.166 --> 00:45:43.433
And the vision that was planted
in my brain

00:45:44.966 --> 00:45:47.000
Still remains

00:45:49.033 --> 00:45:55.033
Within the sound of silence

00:46:23.033 --> 00:46:24.233
Do you hear something?

00:46:25.933 --> 00:46:26.933
What's wrong with this?

00:46:27.233 --> 00:46:28.233
Hey, help me take a look.

00:46:28.233 --> 00:46:29.233
Is there something wrong?

00:46:29.234 --> 00:46:30.733
I spent 10,000 HKD on this guitar.

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:32.365
Not bad. Take your time looking.

00:46:32.366 --> 00:46:34.233
- I'll clean up.
- Help me take a look.

00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:24.933
Eat something first.

00:47:25.333 --> 00:47:26.433
Thank you, Jia Jia.

00:47:39.233 --> 00:47:40.566
I trust Mr. Shi.

00:47:41.266 --> 00:47:42.933
I know he's not a black cop.

00:47:48.133 --> 00:47:49.133
Judge Qin,

00:47:49.233 --> 00:47:50.233
in the police murder case,

00:47:50.234 --> 00:47:51.432
the defendant was not found
guilty of murder,

00:47:51.433 --> 00:47:52.599
but of manslaughter.

00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:54.832
Does this mean the court believes...

00:47:54.833 --> 00:47:56.399
Shi Zhi Yang
was involved in illegal activities?

00:47:56.400 --> 00:47:57.533
In this case,

00:47:58.033 --> 00:48:00.166
the court is only responsible...

00:48:00.466 --> 00:48:02.376
for determining if the defendant
is guilty of murder.

00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:04.000
It is not for determining...

00:48:04.333 --> 00:48:06.333
if the deceased
was involved in illegal activities.

00:48:06.466 --> 00:48:08.633
Any classification
of the deceased's identity...

00:48:08.866 --> 00:48:11.133
must be investigated
and confirmed...

00:48:11.466 --> 00:48:12.586
by the relevant departments.

00:48:12.833 --> 00:48:15.232
The media shouldn't make
too many assumptions...

00:48:15.233 --> 00:48:17.800
or publish unconfirmed information.

00:48:18.233 --> 00:48:19.233
Judge Qin,

00:48:19.234 --> 00:48:20.532
can Hokong return...

00:48:20.533 --> 00:48:21.773
to the rule of law it once had?

00:48:23.266 --> 00:48:24.933
This question is not valid.

00:48:25.266 --> 00:48:26.966
That's because the rule of law
in Hokong...

00:48:27.833 --> 00:48:29.333
has never deteriorated.

00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:37.400
Judge Qin.

00:48:37.533 --> 00:48:38.533
Inspector Tang is here.

00:48:41.333 --> 00:48:42.333
Inspector Tang.

00:48:42.533 --> 00:48:43.533
Congratulations.

00:48:43.766 --> 00:48:46.266
You've sentenced Han Gang's killer.

00:48:46.966 --> 00:48:48.166
Why are you congratulating me?

00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:49.800
Shi Zhi Yang told me...

00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:52.799
that you were the prosecutor...

00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:55.200
for the first trial of the Huyan
Wooden Shed Area Arson Case.

00:48:56.033 --> 00:48:57.433
That was 20 years ago.

00:48:57.866 --> 00:48:58.866
He also said...

00:48:59.133 --> 00:49:00.633
that you easily remembered...

00:49:00.866 --> 00:49:02.766
that the case happened in 1978.

00:49:03.933 --> 00:49:05.866
You have a photographic memory.

00:49:06.133 --> 00:49:07.609
Everyone in the legal world
knows that.

00:49:07.633 --> 00:49:08.633
Back then,

00:49:09.133 --> 00:49:10.333
I read the case briefly.

00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:12.933
Did you notice
anything strange about it?

00:49:16.133 --> 00:49:17.600
It's a case from 1978.

00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:19.566
I don't remember it clearly.

00:49:22.933 --> 00:49:23.933
It was a long time ago.

00:49:24.733 --> 00:49:25.733
That's right.

00:49:25.866 --> 00:49:28.533
I did review the first trial
of that case back then.

00:49:29.333 --> 00:49:30.400
It has been so many years.

00:49:31.166 --> 00:49:32.533
I've long forgotten the content.

00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:34.733
Do you mean...

00:49:35.233 --> 00:49:36.593
that you didn't tell him anything?

00:49:37.666 --> 00:49:39.000
I had nothing to tell him.

00:49:40.133 --> 00:49:41.433
The truth of this case...

00:49:42.266 --> 00:49:44.232
may be the real reason...

00:49:44.233 --> 00:49:45.793
that Shi Zhi Yang
was killed and framed.

00:49:46.533 --> 00:49:48.599
As for how you got
Shi Zhiyang's killer...

00:49:48.600 --> 00:49:50.200
to also admit to killing Han Gang,

00:49:50.933 --> 00:49:52.173
you're probably the only one...

00:49:52.433 --> 00:49:54.166
who knows the reason behind it.

00:49:54.866 --> 00:49:56.032
That's because
there was sufficient evidence...

00:49:56.033 --> 00:49:57.033
presented in court.

00:50:02.333 --> 00:50:03.933
Think og Shi Zhi Yang's life...

00:50:05.233 --> 00:50:06.832
and the 104 lives...

00:50:06.833 --> 00:50:08.633
lost in the Huyan
Wooden Shed Area Arson Case.

00:50:08.866 --> 00:50:10.306
No matter how much you've forgotten,

00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:12.033
I hope you don't forget...

00:50:12.733 --> 00:50:14.199
the original intention
and conscience you had...

00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:15.466
when you became a judge.
