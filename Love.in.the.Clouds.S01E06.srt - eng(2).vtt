it's actually very simple.

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:47.790

you

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:50.310

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:56.400

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:44.400

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:51.750
If Lord Hanfeng hadn't told me

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:53.550
that they went back to Huansha Market,

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:54.720

Thank goodness.

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:13.990
No, Tianji is still sick.

00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:16.230
What did Tianji touch just now?

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:17.840
That hairpin.

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:19.110
After touching it,

00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:20.870
she started feeling ill.

00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:23.160
It was Ji Bozai.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:26.190
Could he be after the Venerable position?

00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:28.790
He has always been ruthless to Tianji.

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:35.280
The Princess was poisoned.

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:36.280
Won't you check on her?

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:39.120
There is too much to see today.

00:08:39.670 --> 00:08:40.550
We can skip this one.

00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:42.360
What do you mean?

00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:45.000
Do you know the story

00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:47.000
about the fox being tricked by the rabbit?

00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:50.470
No matter how sly the fox is,

00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:52.520
if it gets soft,

00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:55.040
its claws will inevitably be blunted.

00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:58.160
In the end, it becomes the rabbit's dinner.

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:02.000
If Ji Bozai really poisoned her...

00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:03.760
Then what?

00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:06.590
I don't have spiritual veins,

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:09.160
but even if there is only a slim chance,

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:12.040
I must do whatever it takes to kill him.

00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:15.000
Is that so?

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:20.000
Tianji, you are awake.

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:35.160
I knew it.

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:40.160
There are seven different poisons.

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:43.190
Ji Bozai couldn't have

00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:44.590
slowly poisoned you over time.

00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:46.880
No one else in this palace could do that.

00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:50.710
You poisoned yourself.

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:56.760
Immortal Yan.

00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:00.310
Are you worried that I might die?

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:03.160
Or are you

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:08.640
afraid that Uncle will hide from you

00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:11.160
his plan to get rid of me?

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:14.190
After all,

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:18.040
that would mean losing his trust.

00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:21.310
That would be earth-shattering for you.

00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:22.590
Mu Tianji!

00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:27.190
You are putting your own life at risk.

00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:28.310
You are being foolish.

00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:29.400
Yan Xiao, you…

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:30.190
Where is the antidote?

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:32.400
Take it now!

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.760
There is no antidote.

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:42.400
- Your Highness... - No.

00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:43.860
I'll get someone to check again.

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:50.920
There is nothing I can do.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.670
My medical skills are limited.

00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:58.160
There is nothing more that I can do.

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:03.830
Yan Xiao, please save Tianji.

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:04.640
Immortal Yan!

00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:53.120
The poison is cleared.

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:07.880
No next time.

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:18.240
The warrior selection has ended.

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:19.950
We will announce the list of candidates.

00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:36.920
Before announcing this round of selected candidates,

00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:39.280
I have an important announcement to make.

00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:43.360
Those who are chosen today

00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:46.000
will not be the final team for the tournament.

00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:48.040
- Why? - Not the final one?

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:48.880
- Why is that? - Yeah!

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:49.640
Yeah, that is strange.

00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:53.470
- Right. - What is the reason for that?

00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:54.470
- Yeah. - Why is that?

00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:55.710
Shouhua Academy

00:12:56.590 --> 00:12:59.160
will continue to welcome talented individuals to apply.

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:00.880
We will select the best among them

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:03.310
until we form the perfect warrior lineup.

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:05.790
We will fight in the next Qingyun Tournament.

00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:11.880
Now, I will announce the preliminary list of chosen ones.

00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:13.760
Chief Warrior.

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:16.950
Warrior Ji Bozai.

00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:23.040
Front Shield, Sun Liao.

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:25.190
- Sun Liao. - Sun Liao is actually not bad.

00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:27.160
Forger, Chen Xi.

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:28.280
- Chen Xi. - Chen Xi?

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:29.360
Why him?

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:30.040
Yeah, why?

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:31.670
His talent in crafting weapons is decent,

00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:32.790
but he is just a kid.

00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:33.590
Exactly.

00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:34.710
He is too young for this.

00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:35.880
He is not fit for this!

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:37.920
Vice Captain, Meng Yangqiu.

00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:38.710
Meng Yangqiu?

00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:39.310
Meng Yangqiu?

00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:40.360
His spiritual veins are strong,

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:41.310
but he is a bit of a fool.

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:42.360
Me?

00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:43.310
Healer,

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:46.790
Yan Xiao.

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:48.710
Immortal Yan may be skilled in medicine,

00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:49.710
but he has no spiritual veins.

00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:51.310
He is as good as dead.

00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:52.360
- Exactly. - That's true.

00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:55.070
Your Highness,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.120
I have no spiritual veins.

00:13:57.520 --> 00:13:59.310
That doesn't meet the rules of the selection.

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:02.950
Immortal Yan Xiao's medical skills

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:04.950
are unmatched throughout Jixing Abyss.

00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:06.760
No one is more qualified than you

00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:09.240
to represent Shouhua Academy as a Healer

00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:11.160
and bring honor to Jixing Abyss.

00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:12.400
But we can't change the old rules.

00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:13.880
Every rule

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:16.520
exists to serve the good of Jixing Abyss.

00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:18.400
If the old rules cannot help Jixing Abyss

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:19.550
win the Qingyun Tournament,

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:22.760
then as the one who leads Shouhua Academy,

00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:24.950
I will change them.

00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:27.120
That is against the rules!

00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:28.790
How can she choose them?

00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:31.950
The Princess is being reckless.

00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:33.830
She has never done something like this before.

00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:35.920
How can she make such a decision?

00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:37.710
The last time,

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:40.550
the Princess defied the old rules

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:42.670
to appoint me as a warrior.

00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:45.710
So what? That is nothing special.

00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:47.190
She is too unreasonable.

00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:48.040
Such arrogance!

00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:49.790
Who does she think she is?

00:14:53.950 --> 00:14:56.520
There was even more criticism last time.

00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:59.310
But everyone saw the result.

00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:00.790
So,

00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:02.160
any doubts or objections

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:04.360
will be mine to bear.

00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:07.160
Your Highness,

00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:08.790
among the contestants,

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:11.520
there are countless with better medical skills than mine.

00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:13.640
I am not worthy to represent us.

00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:18.280
Is that so?

00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:22.000
During the selection,

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:23.790
I was unfortunately poisoned.

00:15:24.190 --> 00:15:25.880
Seven different poisons were mixed together.

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:27.000
Almost impossible to cure.

00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:30.160
Xiuyun asked every physician present at the time,

00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:31.470
but none could find a cure.

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:34.280
Yet you, Immortal Yan Xiao,

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:36.160
created an antidote

00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:38.710
that countered all seven poisons in such a short amount of time.

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:40.240
Everyone here

00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:42.160
was deeply convinced by your skill.

00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:43.190
That's right.

00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:44.920
I saw it with my own eyes.

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:48.160
They saw it too.

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:49.830
Yes, we can attest to that.

00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:52.000
You should not belittle yourself.

00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:56.550
Immortal Yan Xiao, you may not have spiritual veins,

00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:58.470
but even with a ten percent chance to win,

00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:00.640
you will still give it your all.

00:16:01.070 --> 00:16:01.790
Am I right?

00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:06.520
The Emperor of Jixing has arrived.

00:16:08.830 --> 00:16:10.790
Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:29.190
Father.

00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:39.620
[Mu Yuanfeng, Emperor of Jixing Abyss]

00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:43.040
At the last Qingyun Tournament,

00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:45.670
Jixing Abyss rose into the Upper Realms.

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:47.160
But I believe

00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:49.120
this is only the beginning.

00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:52.710
More victories await us in the future.

00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:56.670
All of you here today

00:16:57.520 --> 00:16:59.920
are willing to fight for Jixing Abyss.

00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:02.160
I am deeply grateful for that.

00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:06.670
I hope that from now on, everyone will give their best,

00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:09.800
and protect the glory of Jixing Abyss.

00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:12.640
We will give our all.

00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:14.950
We will safeguard the glory of Jixing Abyss.

00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:18.360
Brother, don't overexert yourself.

00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:20.120
You should return and rest.

00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:22.400
I will head back now.

00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:27.160
Who is that person?

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:29.320
Isn't that…

00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:31.800
It's him!

00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:33.820
- That's right. - Yes.

00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:37.650
Why did he suddenly show up?

00:17:37.650 --> 00:17:40.510
I am the condemned Immortal Hou Zhao. I request to see His Majesty.

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:47.750
Hou Zhao?

00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:49.510
Didn't he go missing long ago?

00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:58.840
I am guilty of unforgivable sins.

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:03.800
Please grant me death, Your Majesty.

00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:12.030
Hou Zhao, you have been missing for so long.

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:13.880
You neglected your duty to the Judgment Hall.

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:16.880
And now you dare show His Majesty such insolence?

00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:18.470
What are your true intentions?

00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:19.360
Guards!

00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:19.950
Yes!

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:21.270
Seize Hou Zhao.

00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:21.920
Yes, Your Lordship.

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:29.840
Wait.

00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:39.640
Immortal Hou Zhao, thank you

00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:41.950
for giving me all your memories.

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:44.640
Otherwise, I will have to spend more effort

00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:46.400
to find the people I want to get rid of.

00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:51.400
Don't forget what I told you to do.

00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:55.080
The Emperor has been unconscious for years.

00:18:55.710 --> 00:18:58.160
But during important occasions, tradition requires his presence.

00:18:59.030 --> 00:19:00.160
Whenever that happens,

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:02.270
he always wakes up as expected.

00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:05.120
This year's warrior selection

00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:07.800
will likely be no exception.

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:09.750
When the time comes,

00:19:10.990 --> 00:19:12.640
you will meet the Emperor in person.

00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:14.600
Confess your crimes in public.

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:17.800
I, the condemned Hou Zhao,

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:20.470
took advantage of my position in the Judgment Hall

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:24.120
to secretly craft Heavenly Grief and Golden Millet Dream.

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:25.120
What?

00:19:25.710 --> 00:19:27.190
Heavenly Grief and Golden Millet Dream?

00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:30.840
Now I realize the weight of my sins.

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:32.750
I am willing to confess.

00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:37.670
Your Majesty, please pass judgment on me.

00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:40.080
Heavenly Grief and Golden Millet Dream?

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:41.080
The Bo clan's elixirs

00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:42.840
that can create spiritual veins?

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:45.880
That formula was lost for centuries in the Six Realms.

00:19:46.030 --> 00:19:47.920
How did he get it?

00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:51.800
Someone has been secretly crafting Heavenly Grief?

00:19:52.670 --> 00:19:53.990
Twenty-two years ago,

00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:56.360
I accidentally obtained

00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:58.230
the medical texts left by the Bo clan.

00:19:59.470 --> 00:20:00.950
I used the Sunken Abyss

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:02.560
and the labor of prisoners

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:04.030
to secretly brew medicine.

00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:06.800
But the manuscript was incomplete.

00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:08.230
Over the years,

00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:11.080
I only managed to create Heavenly Grief,

00:20:12.510 --> 00:20:13.840
never Golden Millet Dream.

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:21.990
If Hou Zhao is telling the truth...

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:23.950
Lord Hanfeng,

00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:27.080
you are in charge of the Sunken Abyss.

00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:28.990
Can you explain this?

00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:31.600
Brother, allow me to explain.

00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:33.840
When I oversaw the Sunken Abyss,

00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:35.600
I have never heard of such nonsense.

00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:42.320
Hou Zhao,

00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:46.030
you had better think carefully before you speak.

00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:47.710
False accusations

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:49.560
could bring disaster upon your entire clan.

00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:52.030
That's right, Hou Zhao.

00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:54.750
Did Lord Hanfeng take part in it or not?

00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:56.270
You must make it clear.

00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:57.470
Tell the truth for his sake.

00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:17.950
It was me.

00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:27.510
Everything was my doing alone.

00:21:28.510 --> 00:21:30.030
When I was managing the Sunken Abyss,

00:21:30.750 --> 00:21:32.710
I forged Lord Hanfeng's handwriting

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:37.030
to use public power for personal gain.

00:21:37.670 --> 00:21:39.360
I forced the prisoners in the Abyss

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:43.710
to make Heavenly Grief for me.

00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:50.750
Immortal Hou Zhao.

00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:54.230
Where is the new worker who was supposed to grind the herbs?

00:21:54.990 --> 00:21:56.750
Right here.

00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:09.800
Hurry up, don't dawdle!

00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:10.470
Go that way.

00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:11.750
Move faster!

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:14.670
Hurry up!

00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:37.800
That way!

00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:54.470
How dare you slack off!

00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:56.750
You're asking for a beating!

00:22:58.470 --> 00:22:59.990
You filthy prisoners!

00:23:00.270 --> 00:23:01.800
Do your job! Grind those herbs!

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:03.510
Don't ever dream of leaving this place alive!

00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:07.880
Immortal Situ.

00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:11.320
If what Hou Zhao said is true,

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:13.800
how should we sentence him?

00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:15.920
This case is too complicated.

00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:18.670
I'll need to investigate carefully

00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:19.840
to confirm the facts

00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:20.800
before giving a verdict.

00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:27.320
Everything I told you

00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:31.120
is the truth!

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:33.950
Very well.

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:35.990
From this day forth,

00:23:36.670 --> 00:23:38.920
Hou Zhao will be imprisoned in the Judgment Hall's prison.

00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:41.470
Once the truth is confirmed,

00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:42.840
he will be tried.

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:44.640
- Good. - Wise decision.

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:45.710
Very wise, Your Majesty.

00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:47.710
I will make sure the Judgment Hall

00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:49.470
gets to the bottom of this.

00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:54.030
Wait.

00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:57.120
Regarding Hou Zhao's crimes,

00:23:57.510 --> 00:23:59.190
I have something to report to His Majesty.

00:24:10.470 --> 00:24:11.400
Don't worry, Immortal Ji.

00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:13.750
You once saved my life.

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:16.710
I will surely repay you.

00:24:19.850 --> 00:24:20.610
What is she up to?

00:24:27.990 --> 00:24:31.120
I am Ruo Shui, a maid from Moonlit Blossoms.

00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:33.470
I can face the punishment for speaking against my superiors.

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:36.230
Despite my humble status, I must accuse Hou Zhao.

00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:40.400
What are you accusing now?

00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:42.080
Your Majesty, please hear me.

00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:43.560
This matter

00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:47.160
is not as simple as Hou Zhao claimed.

00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:51.190
Those so-called prisoners who helped him brew medicine in the Sunken Abyss

00:24:51.670 --> 00:24:52.470
were actually

00:24:53.190 --> 00:24:55.230
innocent immortals he had abducted.

00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:31.560
He used dark-spirit chains

00:25:32.270 --> 00:25:34.320
to enslave them as laborers.

00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:36.160
The toxic runoff

00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:37.750
of the refinery polluted nearby villages.

00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:40.160
Hou Zhao knew this perfectly well,

00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:41.750
but he refused to stop.

00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:43.750
Lady,

00:25:44.270 --> 00:25:45.600
how do you know all this?

00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:48.800
What is your relationship with Hou Zhao?

00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:51.400
I am

00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:55.470
his illegitimate daughter.

00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:57.750
- Illegitimate daughter? - Really?

00:25:57.800 --> 00:25:59.080
You just said

00:25:59.710 --> 00:26:01.800
Hou Zhao is your biological father.

00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:05.080
Then, why would you expose him?

00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:06.400
- Exactly. - Yeah, why?

00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:08.840
Fairy Ruo Shui,

00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:11.710
perhaps you could explain the whole story

00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:14.950
so the Judgment Hall can pass its verdict.

00:26:23.950 --> 00:26:24.800
Ruo Shui,

00:26:26.270 --> 00:26:27.920
I was wrong to abandon you

00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:29.400
and your mother.

00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:32.710
I've been trying to make it up to you all these years.

00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:36.470
Please, stop hating me.

00:26:41.670 --> 00:26:42.800
You think you deserve pity?

00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:47.320
Now you want to act like a good father?

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:50.920
When I was born with Withered-Branch Disease,

00:26:50.990 --> 00:26:52.360
the sign of Total Deterioration,

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:56.320
you cast me and my mother aside without hesitation.

00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:02.230
Mother fell sick from grief and exhaustion.

00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:04.750
She eventually died because of it.

00:27:14.030 --> 00:27:15.840
Heaven's justice never fails.

00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:17.880
You abandoned us

00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:21.270
just to have a healthy child.

00:27:22.190 --> 00:27:23.800
But your entire Hou bloodline

00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:26.560
died from the same disease!

00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:29.750
Only I

00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:32.560
survived to this day.

00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:35.080
If not for this,

00:27:36.270 --> 00:27:38.360
you would've never remembered you had a daughter.

00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:41.320
Hou Zhao is cold and heartless.

00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:42.950
How could I not hate him?

00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:44.990
He's done nothing but evil all his life.

00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:50.270
Even so,

00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:52.710
your word alone might not be enough.

00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:54.670
There must be proof.

00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:55.670
Your Majesty,

00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:57.080
besides myself,

00:27:57.670 --> 00:27:58.600
I also have a witness.

00:28:01.710 --> 00:28:02.800
Fairy Ming Yi.

00:28:07.710 --> 00:28:08.800
When I worked at Moonlit Blossoms,

00:28:09.230 --> 00:28:10.950
I never spoke to Fairy Ming Yi,

00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:12.470
but I knew

00:28:12.710 --> 00:28:14.800
her parents were herb gatherers

00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:16.320
and lived in the Freezing Hot Waters.

00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:19.230
Ming Yi,

00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:22.510
did you see how your parents died?

00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:43.080
My Lord,

00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:45.470
my family lived in the Freezing Hot Waters for generations.

00:28:45.510 --> 00:28:46.990
We survived by gathering herbs.

00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:49.230
This room will be yours from now on.

00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:50.230
Five days from now,

00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:51.190
Shouhua Academy

00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:53.600
will hold its selection for the next Qingyun Tournament.

00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:56.080
His Lordship wants you to attend with him.

00:28:57.640 --> 00:28:59.030
She's my amulet too.

00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:15.190
What a grand scheme you've played.

00:29:16.270 --> 00:29:18.400
Even I turned out to be just a pawn in your game.

00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:22.950
I borrowed the identity of the Ming family's daughter.

00:29:23.510 --> 00:29:25.950
Today, I must seek justice for them.

00:29:27.510 --> 00:29:28.950
When my parents died,

00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:31.230
their faces turned purple,

00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:36.270
and veins like spider webs spread across their bodies.

00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:38.510
They suffered terribly.

00:29:43.030 --> 00:29:43.750
Ming Yi,

00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:46.120
why didn't you tell me

00:29:46.470 --> 00:29:47.600
about your parents?

00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:54.600
You've used me anyway.

00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:55.840
Why pretend now?

00:29:56.430 --> 00:29:57.800
Physicians,

00:29:58.320 --> 00:29:59.320
what kind of symptoms

00:29:59.710 --> 00:30:01.190
did Ming Yi's parents show?

00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:07.030
Physician Yan Xiao,

00:30:07.270 --> 00:30:09.270
can you tell us what caused it?

00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:12.880
From what you described,

00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:15.080
they must have been exposed to Blood Pearl Bloom

00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:16.270
for a long time.

00:30:16.270 --> 00:30:17.080
Blood Pearl Bloom?

00:30:17.230 --> 00:30:18.600
That's deadly poison!

00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:21.190
As far as I know,

00:30:21.470 --> 00:30:23.080
the herb gatherers at the Freezing Hot Waters

00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:24.800
often died mysteriously near the Sunken Abyss

00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:27.230
after drinking from its spring.

00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:28.560
The source of the poison

00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:32.080
was the highly toxic Blood Pearl Bloom.

00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:38.230
I know that bringing such accusations will subject me

00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:39.320
to punishment.

00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:42.120
I, Ming Yi,

00:30:42.510 --> 00:30:45.470
am also accusing someone above me.

00:30:47.270 --> 00:30:48.230
I was powerless

00:30:48.990 --> 00:30:52.640
and only today did I learn my parents were wrongfully killed.

00:30:54.190 --> 00:30:55.160
In the Freezing Hot Waters,

00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:57.400
there could be many others like my parents

00:30:58.510 --> 00:30:59.750
who were forced by hardship

00:31:00.030 --> 00:31:02.400
to work near the polluted waters of the Sunken Abyss

00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:04.270
and lost their lives unjustly.

00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:08.030
So today, I stand before you

00:31:08.510 --> 00:31:10.800
to seek justice for all the fallen herb gatherers.

00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:15.190
Your Majesty,

00:31:16.470 --> 00:31:18.360
I came from the Sunken Abyss myself.

00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:20.230
Other than the daily beatings,

00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:22.230
I transported Blood Pearl Blooms.

00:31:22.950 --> 00:31:23.920
I can testify to this.

00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:35.120
Ming Yi, don't worry.

00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:37.990
I'll be your witness.

00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:40.470
Your parents' death won't be in vain.

00:31:41.470 --> 00:31:42.320
Trust me.

00:31:48.510 --> 00:31:49.230
Ji Bozai,

00:31:50.190 --> 00:31:51.190
this is a serious matter.

00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:53.360
Choose your words carefully.

00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:55.600
Answer truthfully.

00:31:56.230 --> 00:31:57.800
Are you saying you were blameless,

00:31:58.030 --> 00:31:59.160
that an innocent man like you

00:31:59.750 --> 00:32:01.470
was thrown into the Sunken Abyss as a prisoner?

00:32:08.030 --> 00:32:10.030
You all gossiped about my past for so long.

00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:12.600
Haven't you ever wondered one thing?

00:32:14.190 --> 00:32:15.470
For as long as I can remember,

00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:17.920
I've always been in the Sunken Abyss.

00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:21.260
[Young Ji Bozai]

00:32:21.510 --> 00:32:22.270
Tell me,

00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:25.270
what crime did I commit?

00:32:29.230 --> 00:32:30.160
So that means

00:32:30.670 --> 00:32:32.710
Immortal Ji has always known

00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:34.120
he was innocent.

00:32:34.670 --> 00:32:37.320
Did you ever think of taking revenge on Hou Zhao?

00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:40.120
This fairy Ruo Shui,

00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:42.270
has lived in the Jixing Abyss for quite some time.

00:32:42.670 --> 00:32:44.640
She never thought of accusing someone above her rank.

00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:47.270
Could it be that someone put her up to it,

00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:49.880
giving her the courage to stand up today?

00:32:50.190 --> 00:32:52.640
Lord Han Feng, it seems you have missed the point.

00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:54.270
Why are you

00:32:54.270 --> 00:32:56.160
focusing on why Ruo Shui spoke up in court?

00:32:57.400 --> 00:32:58.670
We should get the priority right.

00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:00.640
Is it more important to know why she exposed Hou Zhao

00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:03.750
or to uncover the truth behind the Sunken Abyss?

00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:05.400
Uncle,

00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:09.030
I think Immortal Ji is right.

00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:10.750
By the way,

00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:15.120
there still seems to be something suspicious about this matter.

00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:26.750
If Hou Zhao operated alone,

00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:30.400
how could he have pulled off something this big?

00:33:30.750 --> 00:33:31.670
Yeah, that's true.

00:33:31.710 --> 00:33:32.920
That makes sense.

00:33:33.950 --> 00:33:34.670
Exactly.

00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:36.640
There's no way he did it alone.

00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:48.560
Hou Zhao,

00:33:49.430 --> 00:33:50.360
raise your head.

00:33:51.030 --> 00:33:53.640
Was someone giving you orders?

00:33:54.270 --> 00:33:55.470
You can speak up today.

00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:58.080
I promise to spare your life.

00:33:58.190 --> 00:33:59.670
Tell us! Come on, speak!

00:33:59.710 --> 00:34:00.620
Tell us!

00:34:02.990 --> 00:34:03.800
Speak up!

00:34:04.030 --> 00:34:05.190
Tell us!

00:34:05.190 --> 00:34:06.030
We want the truth!

00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:07.400
- Tell us! - Who is it?

00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:08.350
- Tell us! - Come on!

00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:09.360
Tell us now!

00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:10.070
Tell us!

00:34:15.150 --> 00:34:16.200
What are you hiding?

00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:17.030
- Say it! - Come on!

00:34:17.030 --> 00:34:18.030
Just say it already!

00:34:18.030 --> 00:34:18.800
Say something!

00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:19.680
You're hiding something!

00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:21.110
- Tell us! - Hurry up!

00:34:21.210 --> 00:34:22.320
Why won't you talk?

00:34:22.590 --> 00:34:24.200
- Come on! - Tell us now!

00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:26.280
- Speak up! - What's the truth?

00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:27.680
- Tell us! - Come on!

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:29.470
Tell us!

00:34:29.590 --> 00:34:30.360
Speak!

00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:30.990
Tell us!

00:34:30.990 --> 00:34:31.680
Speak up!

00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:32.360
Tell us!

00:34:32.950 --> 00:34:33.720
Actually…

00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:34.240
Go on, tell us!

00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:35.470
If you don't talk, you'll die.

00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:37.320
Come on!

00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:38.280
Your Majesty!

00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:39.030
Father!

00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:41.360
Yan Xiao, check what's wrong with my brother.

00:34:42.590 --> 00:34:43.400
His Majesty is...

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:51.590
How is he?

00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:53.320
He has been overexerting.

00:34:54.470 --> 00:34:55.760
He just needs to rest in the palace.

00:34:56.470 --> 00:34:57.590
Escort my brother back.

00:34:58.550 --> 00:34:59.360
Father.

00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:06.190
That was all too sudden.

00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:20.630
Tianji, if you're worried,

00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:21.920
you can go with him.

00:35:24.030 --> 00:35:25.110
That won't be necessary, Uncle.

00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:30.590
Thank you for saving him in time.

00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:37.880
Now that everything's been made clear,

00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:39.680
and my brother is unwell,

00:35:40.070 --> 00:35:42.720
I will take his place for now and deliver the verdict

00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:43.880
on Hou Zhao.

00:35:46.510 --> 00:35:48.800
I am Situ Ling, Chief of Judgment Hall.

00:35:49.990 --> 00:35:51.950
Strip Hou Zhao of his immortal title,

00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:53.360
brand him a sinner,

00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:55.840
and sentence him to heavenly lightning.

00:35:56.110 --> 00:35:57.400
Crush his primordial spirit, scatter his soul

00:35:57.880 --> 00:35:58.800
across the Six Realms.

00:35:58.950 --> 00:36:00.200
- Good! - Well said!

00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:01.630
- Justice served! - He deserves it!

00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:04.630
That's the right call.

00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:06.990
People like him should have no peace.

00:36:06.990 --> 00:36:07.470
Exactly.

00:36:07.470 --> 00:36:08.630
- Indeed. - Agreed!

00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:09.240
Serves him right!

00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:10.920
A just verdict!

00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:17.630
Thank you, Lord Hanfeng,

00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:18.920
for standing up for me.

00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:20.400
No need.

00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:21.630
Don't worry.

00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:24.150
I will make sure Hou Zhao pays for his crimes

00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:25.840
and that you have justice.

00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:29.800
Fairy Ruo Shui.

00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:34.280
Tell me, who sent you here today?

00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:39.280
Don't be afraid.

00:36:40.110 --> 00:36:41.240
I am only asking

00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:43.550
so I can protect you better

00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:45.240
and whoever stands behind you.

00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:47.510
Thank you, Lord Hanfeng,

00:36:48.590 --> 00:36:49.550
but…

00:36:51.470 --> 00:36:52.510
No one sent me.

00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:55.200
I chose to reveal the truth myself.

00:36:57.800 --> 00:36:58.550
Is that so?

00:37:01.590 --> 00:37:03.840
Immortal Ji, you have spent a lot of time at Moonlit Blossoms.

00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:05.320
Have you ever seen

00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:07.590
Fairy Ruo Shui with anyone before?

00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:08.590
Moonlit Blossoms?

00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:10.150
It's too crowded

00:37:10.150 --> 00:37:11.880
for me to see the same one twice.

00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:15.880
Fairy Ruo Shui

00:37:16.110 --> 00:37:18.200
does look a little unfamiliar.

00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:20.030
Besides, I haven't gone there in a long time.

00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:23.470
Now that I have Ming Yi,

00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:25.150
why would I need to go there again?

00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:27.920
Right?

00:37:33.590 --> 00:37:34.400
Lord Hanfeng,

00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:36.240
if Lord Ji ever goes back

00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:38.470
and flirts with some fairy there,

00:37:38.470 --> 00:37:39.590
you must tell me.

00:37:39.990 --> 00:37:41.550
I'll make him pay for it.

00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:44.920
Fairy Ming Yi, you misunderstand.

00:37:46.030 --> 00:37:47.840
Immortal Ji and I

00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:50.550
were only discussing official matters.

00:37:52.030 --> 00:37:54.150
You two have shown great courage,

00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:55.920
but rules must still be followed.

00:37:57.360 --> 00:37:58.550
For defying authority,

00:37:59.150 --> 00:38:00.320
you must still face punishment.

00:38:01.030 --> 00:38:01.950
I understand.

00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:20.550
Immortal Ji,

00:38:22.430 --> 00:38:24.630
there is something important

00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:25.950
I must discuss with you.

00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:27.550
Will you spare me some time?

00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:33.150
Something important?

00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:36.880
Sure.

00:38:47.510 --> 00:38:49.240
You scoundrel, Ji Bozai!

00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:52.800
May you trip the moment you step out the door,

00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:55.360
lose the soles of your shoes on the road,

00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:58.360
and chip your teeth while eating!

00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:01.920
One more thing...

00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:04.470
Fairy Ming Yi.

00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:07.110
Immortal Ji is a good man.

00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:09.280
Stop cursing him already.

00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:12.070
You think he is a good man?

00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:17.110
Haven't you seen him

00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:19.840
surrounded by fairies at Moonlit Blossoms?

00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:20.800
Don't be so naive.

00:39:21.070 --> 00:39:22.320
But it's the truth.

00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:23.880
You have to believe me.

00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:25.680
At Moonlit Blossoms,

00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:28.030
he was always proper with them.

00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:29.680
Nothing ever happened.

00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:32.360
He really is a good, kind man.

00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:34.550
Nothing ever happened.

00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:37.630
He really is a good, kind man.

00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:39.360
Please don't misunderstand him.

00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:40.720
I didn't misunderstand.

00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:43.030
You're the one he fooled.

00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:45.840
You think he is being kind,

00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:47.510
but he is only using you.

00:39:47.510 --> 00:39:49.840
Don't think he actually cares about you.

00:39:56.990 --> 00:39:58.320
Qibai,

00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:00.400
you've refilled this teacup so many times,

00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:02.070
but what exactly is this

00:40:02.070 --> 00:40:03.150
important matter?

00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:09.030
Perhaps I caught a chill.

00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:11.200
Let me head back and rest a while.

00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:11.950
We talk another day.

00:40:11.950 --> 00:40:12.590
Wait.

00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:15.110
The physician is right here.

00:40:15.470 --> 00:40:17.070
I can have someone bring you medicine.

00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:18.720
It should cure that chill of yours.

00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:24.240
The matter with Hou Zhao

00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:26.720
was truly shocking and lurid.

00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:29.150
I blame myself

00:40:29.630 --> 00:40:31.720
for neglecting the Freezing Hot Waters.

00:40:32.950 --> 00:40:34.680
I failed His Majesty.

00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:37.360
Today is a good opportunity.

00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:38.720
I just wanted

00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:40.950
to have a deeper talk with you, Bozai.

00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:42.470
So that we can all

00:40:42.590 --> 00:40:44.590
prevent such tragedies.

00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:48.030
Well said, Lord Hanfeng.

00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:49.840
However…

00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:54.590
I've barely left my little fairy behind,

00:40:54.590 --> 00:40:56.150
and I'm already missing her.

00:40:57.990 --> 00:40:58.680
Wait.

00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:00.510
Bozai.

00:41:02.590 --> 00:41:04.150
Being Chief of Judgment Hall is tiring.

00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:05.800
I have to double-check

00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:07.200
the witnesses of every case.

00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:14.950
He was pure with all those fairies at Moonlit Blossoms?

00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:15.990
No way.

00:41:16.510 --> 00:41:17.470
It's not like he is insane.

00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:22.110
No, maybe he isn't.

00:41:23.950 --> 00:41:24.880
Is he, though?

00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:28.880
Forget it, you're still young.

00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:32.150
Just remember this.

00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:34.550
Ji Bozai treats everyone

00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:36.720
like pieces on his chessboard.

00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:39.510
He calculates every move around them.

00:41:40.030 --> 00:41:40.800
Watch out!

00:41:44.470 --> 00:41:45.550
A netherbeast!

00:41:45.950 --> 00:41:46.800
Impossible!

00:41:48.030 --> 00:41:49.510
