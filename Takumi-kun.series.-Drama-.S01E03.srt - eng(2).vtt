00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:26.720
For Takumi,

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.090
I made a bet.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.300
Nozaki.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.890
You haven't given up on him yet?

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.760
That guy's pretty uptight, you know.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:43.290
It won't be a problem.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.550
I just need to get him
to go out with me once.

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:50.960
Winning him over will be a piece of cake.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.300
I'll get Hayama, even
if I have to play rough.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.330
My, you're awfully confident.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.050
Once I have him,

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:01.340
he'll never leave.

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:05.450
Nozaki-san.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:07.830
Nozaki, we're heading out.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.350
What kind of nonsense
have you been spouting?

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.070
If you dare lay a hand on Hayama,

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:16.760
I'll make you regret it.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.310
You say that like you own Hayama.

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:24.420
He doesn't belong to anyone.

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.560
Who Hayama dates is
his own choice, isn't it?

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.500
In that case,

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.860
let's settle this.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.800
Make a bet with me.

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.720
Let's bet on who can
win over Hayama Takumi.

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.060
I'm not making that kind of bet.

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.540
In that case,

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.020
I'll do as I please from now on.

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:52.210
You're okay with that, right?

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:05.920
So...

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.110
Gii did it to protect me?

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:09.330
That's right.

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.850
They're both really confident
in their physical abilities.

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.506
So they're using the long-distance run
in the fitness test to settle the bet.

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:15.730
A bet over Hayama.

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.390
So if Gii wins, what happens to Nozaki-san?

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.850
He has to take a punch from Gii.

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.810
And promise to leave Hayama Takumi alone.

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.320
And if Gii loses?

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.480
Then Gii has to take a punch.

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.820
And Nozaki gets to go after Hayama.

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.370
Something like that...

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:35.810
It's no big deal.

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.319
For Gii,

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.710
it's not something you can just brush off
as "no big deal."

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.140
Nozaki is the captain
of the basketball team.

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.080
He's the best athlete in the whole school.

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.800
Even Gii might not be a match for him.

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.570
But Gii still took the bet.

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.100
Gii's not the kind of guy who'd make a bet
like that just because he's your roommate.

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:59.410
What that means is,

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:00.470
you get it, don't you?

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:02.430
Huh?

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:04.960
Anyway,

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.420
don't tell Gii I'm the one
who spilled the beans.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.860
I don't want to end up in
the hospital before midterms.

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:19.780
Gii.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.100
"Takumi-kun series -Drama-"
(Episode 3)

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:35.270
I heard it's better to learn
English starting from its etymology.

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.670
For example...

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:37.670
Don't bother.

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.040
Huh?

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:41.950
Who cares about English? It doesn't matter.

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.000
What if you get a failing grade?

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.860
That might even be better.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.430
That jerk.

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:59.560
Gii?

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:04.490
Hey, Shozo.

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:06.210
What the hell did you do?

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:07.590
My hands were tied.

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:08.380
Forgive me.

00:05:08.381 --> 00:05:10.179
You've got a lot of nerve.

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:11.250
Gii! Stop!

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:12.889
I hate bets.

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:14.940
I don't want you making
a bet like that, Gii.

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:17.400
Please,

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:18.840
let him go.

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:26.770
Geez, you brute.

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:29.400
Just do your best in the long-distance run.

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:37.900
Yeah.

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.500
Something I want?

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:42.040
Something I want, huh...

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:45.830
Oh, it's okay.

00:05:45.831 --> 00:05:48.430
Even if I asked my mom,
I wouldn't get it anyway.

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:51.290
A cellphone?

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:53.500
No, it's fine.

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:55.200
The reception is bad here anyway.

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:56.990
Yeah.

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:59.610
Well, I should probably go.

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:01.830
Okay.

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:03.770
Good night.

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:16.820
I chose to apply to Shido Gakuin

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:21.840
because of my parents' divorce.

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:27.610
I thought if I went to a boarding
school like Shido Gakuin,

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:32.300
it wouldn't matter so much
who I ended up living with.

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:39.380
The thing I want...

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:44.900
My parents, as they are
now, can't give it to me.

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:53.330
Because the thing I want most is...

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:09.360
Hey.

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:10.590
Gii?

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:31.360
About the last committee meeting...

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:32.610
What did you think?

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:35.129
The first one was
basically a meet-and-greet.

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:36.790
So that's about what I expected.

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:39.090
You did a great job
leading it as the chairman.

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:42.390
That's all thanks to you, Akaike-kun.

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:44.400
I'm honored you'd say so.

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:45.710
Well then, senpai.

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:47.320
I'll see you at the next meeting.

00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:48.410
Oh... yeah.

00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:06.050
Jeez.

00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:08.340
Yesterday was a complete disaster.

00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:10.710
All because someone let it slip.

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:12.090
Oh, Akaike-kun.

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.760
Sorry, I didn't mean to tell him...

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:17.240
So,

00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:19.390
did you two have a proper talk after that?

00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:23.950
I see.

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:27.646
You know Gii, despite how he seems, he's
actually carrying a lot on his shoulders.

00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:30.170
Burdens we can't even imagine.

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:33.320
Try to be more understanding of him.

00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:35.470
Huh? What do you mean?

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:39.270
You don't know anything, do you, Hayama?

00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:41.840
What do you and Gii even
talk about when you're together?

00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:43.630
Well...

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:49.670
During Golden Week,

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:52.190
you know Gii was in New York, right?

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:53.840
Yeah.

00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:56.020
He said something about a family matter.

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:58.830
His parents are still in the States.

00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:02.379
The reason he was in the US until he was 15

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:04.400
was because of his father's work.

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:06.130
After all,

00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:09.120
his father is the CEO of a
major global corporation.

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:10.500
What...?!

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:13.470
Gii is that CEO's only son.

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:15.900
He's destined to take over
the family business someday.

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.860
His recent trip to New York
was also for company-related business.

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:21.090
So that's what it was.

00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:23.790
Hayama.

00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:26.710
You...

00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:28.960
How do you really see Gii?

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:32.340
Huh?

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:35.646
You should try to get to know him better.

00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:36.870
Learn more about who he is.

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:50.580
The El NiÃ±o phenomenon...

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:52.899
is caused by certain factors

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:54.960
that lead to a weakening
of the trade winds...

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:02.560
Gii...

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:04.600
I don't know anything.

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:08.830
He's carrying so much on his shoulders.

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:11.860
And yet, I...

00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:16.520
I really need to...

00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:18.570
have a proper talk with him.

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:27.400
Now, to explain in more detail...

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:32.310
Okay, we'll go over the details
next time. That's all for today.

00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:45.270
Hey, Gii...

00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:56.140
Gii, wait.

00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:58.720
Gii.

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:08.700
Gii.

00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:21.950
Hey.

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:23.700
Gii.

00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:25.760
I need to talk to you.

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:28.000
Want to join me?

00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:29.950
Huh?

00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:33.050
For long-distance run practice.

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:39.010
I don't care what Nozaki-san says about me.

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:41.130
But I do.

00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:43.440
It's fine. I can handle him.

00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:45.350
It's not that simple.

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:48.880
He seems like all talk.

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:50.800
It depends on who he's up against.

00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:57.650
Takumi.

00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:59.000
Are you worried about me?

00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:01.410
Of course not.

00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:04.000
I'm not worried at all.

00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:06.890
Even if you get punched, Gii,

00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:08.700
I...

00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:10.990
I...

00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:16.890
Takumi.

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:19.830
Please don't

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:21.870
make this any harder for me.

00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:44.170
Takumi?

00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:47.290
You don't have to

00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:49.810
cherish me so much.

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:51.840
Takumi.

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:53.930
What about your aversion to being touched?

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:55.740
Is it okay for you to be this close?

00:12:57.880 --> 00:12:59.460
I forgot for a moment...

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:03.900
But

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:05.300
logically, I'm still...

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:07.960
Ah, if you could, I'd
like you to move away.

00:13:11.070 --> 00:13:12.360
Takumi-kun.

00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:14.880
If you don't mind, instead of from behind,

00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:17.580
could you move to the front?

00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:20.490
The front?

00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:23.250
Here.

00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:27.050
You're holding on so tight, Takumi.

00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:30.050
You're making me lose my self-control.

00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:46.170
Let's save it for later.

00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:48.890
The rest of it.

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:52.270
Talk to me after I win.

00:13:58.520 --> 00:13:59.520
Gii.

00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:09.540
And so,

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:11.100
it began.

00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:14.660
Gii's long-distance run training

00:14:15.010 --> 00:14:17.070
started at the same time as midterms.

00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:29.270
My English score

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:30.390
was a 63.

00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:34.710
I just barely managed
to avoid a make-up exam.

00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:40.350
Then,

00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:42.670
the day of the physical
fitness test arrived.

00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:57.156
The third-years' long-distance run

00:14:57.180 --> 00:14:58.280
seemed to be over.

00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:00.290
So? What was Nozaki's time?

00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:02.070
4 minutes, 45 seconds.

00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:04.910
Compared to Gii's practice times so far...

00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:06.670
Hmm... It's gonna be a toss-up.

00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:08.350
Is that so?

00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:08.950
Um, Gii.

00:15:08.951 --> 00:15:10.710
Is there anything I can do to help?

00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:12.730
You'll cheer for me, won't you?

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:14.580
Of course.

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:16.800
That's all I need.

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:20.760
Gii.

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:23.620
I didn't think I cared
about this bet at all,

00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:27.200
but I absolutely don't
want to see you lose.

00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:30.620
This isn't a bet.

00:15:33.190 --> 00:15:34.390
It's a showdown.

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:40.040
Gii.

00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:41.150
Please.

00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:43.180
You have to win.

00:15:44.450 --> 00:15:47.490
I've never seen Gii care so
much about someone before.

00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:50.370
I...

00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:53.010
I love Gii.

00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:55.550
So,

00:15:56.250 --> 00:15:57.640
I want him to win, no matter what.

00:15:58.770 --> 00:16:00.170
So you finally admit it.

00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:01.830
He'd be

00:16:02.070 --> 00:16:03.620
so happy to hear you say that.

00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:07.860
Even if something were
to happen with Nozaki,

00:16:08.370 --> 00:16:10.650
I don't care what he does to me.
It doesn't matter at all.

00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:12.470
Hayama, are you serious?

00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:14.860
But...

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:16.690
if that were to happen,

00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:18.190
and it would make Gii sad,

00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:20.270
then I don't want that.

00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:23.120
I don't want to hurt Gii.

00:16:24.090 --> 00:16:25.090
That's why,

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:26.760
no matter what,

00:16:26.761 --> 00:16:28.640
I want Gii to win this showdown.

00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:32.310
In that case,

00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:34.190
for the final lap,

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:36.100
you should run ahead
of him and set the pace.

00:16:36.850 --> 00:16:38.489
He always fades

00:16:38.490 --> 00:16:40.150
in the final sprint.

00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:41.370
With you out in front,

00:16:41.371 --> 00:16:43.411
Gii will surely be able to
push through to the end.

00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:44.550
Got it.

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:49.019
To Gii, you're a treasure.

00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:50.910
He cherishes you dearly, Hayama.

00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:53.310
So,

00:16:54.390 --> 00:16:56.990
don't you ever say again that
you don't care what happens to you.

00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:02.620
I know.

00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:20.490
On your marks...

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:22.040
Go!

00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:27.170
Gii!

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:10.060
Go for it, Gii!

00:18:10.810 --> 00:18:12.260
All right, final lap!

00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:19.830
Gii.

00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:09.690
Ah.

00:19:10.270 --> 00:19:11.670
4 minutes, 39 seconds.

00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:13.250
That's a new Shido record.

00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:14.430
Yes!

00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:17.040
That's amazing, Gii.

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:19.690
Thank you.

00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:21.630
Huh?

00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:23.520
Thank you for winning.

00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:28.020
Was there ever any doubt?

00:19:28.690 --> 00:19:30.100
For the person I love,

00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:33.220
I can do anything.

00:19:36.410 --> 00:19:37.410
Gii.

00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:45.590
For me, Gii

00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:47.370
gave it everything he had.

00:19:53.170 --> 00:19:54.470
I suppose it's about time...

00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:58.260
that I made up my mind.

00:20:22.790 --> 00:20:23.990
I'm home.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.000
Huh? Nobody's here?

00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:42.020
Greek mythology.

00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:59.160
Artemis.

00:21:00.810 --> 00:21:02.230
The goddess of the moon.

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:06.780
Artemis.

00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:10.660
Artemis.

00:21:40.930 --> 00:21:42.010
It looks like...

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:51.160
ARTEMIS.

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:57.470
ARATAMISU (Arata Misu).

00:22:06.490 --> 00:22:07.690
I'm home.

00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:17.320
Is club practice over?

00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:20.030
It's pouring outside.

00:22:20.770 --> 00:22:23.100
The coach just told us to train on our own.

00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:24.940
Oh.

00:22:38.850 --> 00:22:40.260
Um, Takabayashi-kun.

00:22:44.990 --> 00:22:46.090
You're not...

00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:48.010
still pouting, are you?

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:50.540
Who's to say?

00:22:53.130 --> 00:22:54.130
Did I...

00:22:54.290 --> 00:22:56.280
do something to upset you?

00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:58.160
And what if you did?

00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:01.790
If I did,

00:23:03.390 --> 00:23:04.670
then I want to apologize.

00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:09.550
- I'm sorry.
- What's that supposed to mean?!

00:23:10.290 --> 00:23:12.180
Don't apologize if you don't even know why!

00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:14.130
But...

00:23:14.270 --> 00:23:15.780
if I did something to hurt you,

00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:16.770
then I have to apologize.

00:23:16.771 --> 00:23:18.571
This is exactly why
people walk all over you.

00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:20.460
Idiot.

00:23:30.270 --> 00:23:32.320
He doesn't understand at all.

00:23:35.530 --> 00:23:37.070
How much I...

00:23:42.250 --> 00:23:43.250
Oh...

00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:45.990
Schauspielerin.

00:23:54.730 --> 00:23:55.730
Gii.

00:23:56.550 --> 00:23:57.900
It's because I love you

00:23:58.100 --> 00:24:00.320
that there are some
things I can't tell you.

00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:05.840
Some things I never want
you, of all people, to know.

00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:08.290
That fateful day...

00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:10.380
June 15th.

00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:21.420
God,

00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:23.790
please give me the courage

00:24:26.330 --> 00:24:28.720
to tell Gii everything.

00:24:30.150 --> 00:24:32.430
Please grant me the
courage to be open with him.
