WEBVTT

00:00:01.292 --> 00:00:02.335
They don't have faces.

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:06.089
M-Matmat cannot draw faces.

00:00:06.172 --> 00:00:07.340
Then practice.

00:00:07.424 --> 00:00:10.135
Mister Samuel, is your wife still alive?

00:00:10.218 --> 00:00:12.178
Is Ma'am Ingrid here in this hospital?

00:00:12.262 --> 00:00:13.179
My wife is dead.

00:00:13.263 --> 00:00:14.639
She can't come back.

00:00:14.723 --> 00:00:16.933
I saw in the CCTV
footage that you were talking to him.

00:00:17.017 --> 00:00:18.893
You've committed
countless offenses, Patrick.

00:00:18.977 --> 00:00:20.645
This is grounds for your termination.

00:00:20.729 --> 00:00:22.313
He's in the isolation room again.

00:00:22.397 --> 00:00:24.023
His condition worsens, Mia.

00:00:24.107 --> 00:00:25.650
He didn't do anything for you?

00:00:25.734 --> 00:00:28.236
I just never felt his presence.

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:31.031
I did something bad.

00:00:31.114 --> 00:00:32.991
Don't think too hard, Samuel.

00:00:33.074 --> 00:00:35.118
I killed my wife.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:44.479
{\an8}Ingrid?

00:01:44.562 --> 00:01:49.734
{\an8}-

00:01:54.781 --> 00:01:56.366
{\an8}You seem to be in a good mood.

00:01:56.449 --> 00:02:01.371
{\an8}-

00:02:08.336 --> 00:02:10.797
Your music's too loud.

00:02:11.464 --> 00:02:12.632
It's hurting my ears.

00:02:23.184 --> 00:02:27.772
{\an8}-

00:02:29.315 --> 00:02:32.068
{\an8}-
A woman was found dead.

00:02:32.152 --> 00:02:35.780
{\an8}The victim was identified as
Tessie Gonzales of Barangay Kahilom.

00:02:35.864 --> 00:02:39.450
{\an8}The victim was with
her son when the crime occurred.

00:02:39.534 --> 00:02:42.078
{\an8}He was unable to give a statement,

00:02:42.162 --> 00:02:46.040
{\an8}as he suffers from an autism disorder.

00:02:46.124 --> 00:02:49.586
{\an8}

00:02:51.212 --> 00:02:57.218
{\an8}

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:09.856
{\an8}What did you do to Tessie?

00:03:13.484 --> 00:03:15.653
{\an8}It's your fault she's dead.

00:03:17.572 --> 00:03:20.116
{\an8}If you'd been content with me and Mia,

00:03:21.284 --> 00:03:23.620
{\an8}I wouldn't have had
to teach your mistress a lesson.

00:03:23.703 --> 00:03:26.497
{\an8}You killed Tessie because
you thought we were having an affair?

00:03:26.581 --> 00:03:28.541
{\an8}

00:03:28.917 --> 00:03:30.877
{\an8}We weren't having an affair, Ingrid!

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.338
{\an8}You've killed an innocent person!

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:34.964
{\an8}

00:03:35.757 --> 00:03:38.259
{\an8}Now that's a look of a grieving lover.

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.304
Face the consequences, Samuel.

00:03:41.387 --> 00:03:43.681
Next time you cheat on me,

00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:46.226
you know what will happen.

00:03:51.022 --> 00:03:53.608
{\an8}- You'll pay for this!
You're the one who should pay!

00:03:53.691 --> 00:03:56.402
{\an8}You're my husband. You're mine.

00:03:56.486 --> 00:03:58.780
{\an8}And when have
you ever been my wife, Ingrid?

00:03:58.863 --> 00:03:59.906
When?!

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:04.577
All you care about is
yourself and your damn book!

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.208
You're even raising
our daughter to be just like you!

00:04:11.501 --> 00:04:14.921
What's wrong if my
daughter turns out just like me?

00:04:16.256 --> 00:04:18.216
If anything happens to me, Ingrid,

00:04:18.841 --> 00:04:21.010
you'll be all she has.

00:04:21.094 --> 00:04:24.305
Is this really how
you intend to raise her?

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:27.558
My daughter is special.

00:04:28.393 --> 00:04:30.395
She is my creation.

00:04:34.274 --> 00:04:38.695
You two are mine and mine alone.

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:44.575
You are a monster, Ingrid!

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:46.577
You're a monster!

00:04:46.661 --> 00:04:48.246
You will pay for this!

00:04:48.329 --> 00:04:50.081
- Come here!
- Samuel--

00:04:50.164 --> 00:04:51.416
You will die!

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:53.126
Samuel, let me go!

00:04:53.209 --> 00:04:54.836
You will die, you monster!

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:56.879
- Damn you!
- Samuel, stop!

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:10.393
Please…

00:05:11.686 --> 00:05:12.812
Samuel!

00:05:27.243 --> 00:05:28.244
Ingrid?

00:05:40.882 --> 00:05:41.883
Ingrid?

00:05:43.551 --> 00:05:44.594
Ingrid.

00:05:45.845 --> 00:05:46.846
Ingrid!

00:06:05.615 --> 00:06:06.324
Ingrid.

00:06:08.993 --> 00:06:09.994
Ingrid!

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.043
I killed her.

00:06:19.378 --> 00:06:21.172
I killed my wife.

00:06:29.263 --> 00:06:30.306
What are you doing?

00:06:31.432 --> 00:06:33.017
U-Um…

00:06:33.726 --> 00:06:35.019
Go inside.

00:06:35.686 --> 00:06:37.522
She doesn't have a nurse aide.

00:06:54.956 --> 00:06:57.416
Ma'am, do you need help with the patient?

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:58.459
No.

00:06:58.543 --> 00:07:00.503
- No, Patrick.
- Mia saw it.

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:10.930
M-Mia saw how I killed my wife.

00:07:20.648 --> 00:07:22.275
Ingrid!

00:07:23.609 --> 00:07:26.487
Ingrid…

00:10:29.503 --> 00:10:31.339
Papa.

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:37.345
Uh, Mia…

00:10:38.262 --> 00:10:39.972
Where'd you go, Papa?

00:10:40.931 --> 00:10:43.309
Uh, nowhere.

00:10:43.392 --> 00:10:45.811
I just went out for a walk.

00:10:50.483 --> 00:10:52.193
Were you with Mama?

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:55.112
No.

00:10:56.113 --> 00:10:58.324
Is she not in the bedroom?

00:11:01.661 --> 00:11:04.163
You should go back to sleep, Mia.

00:11:07.375 --> 00:11:09.418
She said nothing,

00:11:10.002 --> 00:11:12.755
but I know she saw what happened.

00:11:14.423 --> 00:11:16.092
Is that why you strangled Mia?

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.055
You wanted to kill
her so she wouldn't turn you in?

00:11:21.138 --> 00:11:22.598
- No, no…
- Patrick.

00:11:22.681 --> 00:11:25.059
I didn't want Ingrid to die.

00:11:25.142 --> 00:11:27.395
I…

00:11:27.478 --> 00:11:31.899
I strangled her because
I didn't want her to turn into a monster.

00:11:31.982 --> 00:11:34.110
A monster like her mother!

00:11:39.657 --> 00:11:41.909
Papa, where's Mama?

00:11:45.996 --> 00:11:47.665
Don't look at me like that.

00:11:54.004 --> 00:11:55.172
Ingrid?

00:11:56.173 --> 00:11:57.341
This can't be.

00:11:57.425 --> 00:11:58.759
- Papa--
- No, this can't be!

00:11:58.843 --> 00:12:01.720
- Papa, enough.
- Just die already.

00:12:03.806 --> 00:12:05.891
Die!

00:12:05.975 --> 00:12:07.810
Die already!

00:12:09.145 --> 00:12:12.731
Mia was innocent.

00:12:12.815 --> 00:12:18.362
It's all… It's all… It's my fault.

00:12:35.713 --> 00:12:37.923
It's all my fault.

00:12:40.968 --> 00:12:43.846
Mia did nothing wrong.

00:12:45.639 --> 00:12:49.518
It was me. It was my fault.

00:12:55.649 --> 00:12:57.776
I didn't kick you out earlier

00:12:57.860 --> 00:13:00.070
because I didn't
want to stress the patient.

00:13:00.154 --> 00:13:02.823
You had no right to enter without orders.

00:13:03.491 --> 00:13:07.536
I was only concerned about you, Eden.

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:11.081
If I needed help, Oliva.
I would've asked right away.

00:13:11.165 --> 00:13:14.835
There are more urgent matters at hand.

00:13:14.919 --> 00:13:17.463
Samuel had a lucid moment.

00:13:18.214 --> 00:13:20.508
We must report this to Doc Anok.

00:13:24.094 --> 00:13:25.137
Patrick.

00:13:27.139 --> 00:13:28.140
Leave us.

00:13:30.142 --> 00:13:31.143
Okay.

00:13:32.269 --> 00:13:33.354
Wait, Patrick.

00:13:35.397 --> 00:13:37.691
Everything that
you heard here is confidential.

00:13:39.318 --> 00:13:40.402
Understood?

00:13:43.572 --> 00:13:44.490
Yes, ma'am.

00:13:46.075 --> 00:13:48.577
If Zelda was telling the truth…

00:13:48.661 --> 00:13:52.498
there are only two people in this hospital
that could be Ingrid Hernandez.

00:13:54.208 --> 00:13:57.169
Ma'am Olivia or Ma'am Eden.

00:14:02.675 --> 00:14:05.219
But whatever I uncover,

00:14:06.845 --> 00:14:08.430
I will get you out, Mia.

00:14:11.517 --> 00:14:13.394
Because you're not your mother.

00:14:49.889 --> 00:14:52.016
Vincent, I'm okay. I can handle this.

00:14:52.099 --> 00:14:54.226
What you should be checking on is Mia.

00:14:54.727 --> 00:14:57.521
I'm sure she's still asleep.

00:14:57.605 --> 00:14:59.481
She'll wake up later.

00:15:04.153 --> 00:15:06.572
Oh, Erika is calling. It's Erika.

00:15:06.655 --> 00:15:08.532
Seems important.
If I were you, I'd pick up.

00:15:08.616 --> 00:15:10.367
- I mean, it's Erika--
- Stop being nosy!

00:15:13.537 --> 00:15:15.247
Hello? Good morning, Erika.

00:15:15.331 --> 00:15:17.917
Hey, it sounds important. I was right.

00:15:18.417 --> 00:15:22.421
Can I call you back later
because there's--

00:15:25.758 --> 00:15:27.259
You're proposing what?!

00:15:31.889 --> 00:15:33.015
Okay, okay.

00:15:33.933 --> 00:15:35.643
Thank you. Bye-bye.

00:15:36.769 --> 00:15:39.063
Proposing? So you're getting married?

00:15:40.648 --> 00:15:43.025
Erika wants to invest
in our publishing house.

00:15:43.108 --> 00:15:45.736
Boss V! That's amazing!

00:15:45.819 --> 00:15:46.946
Is it true?

00:15:47.029 --> 00:15:50.199
If that's real,
the company will come back to life.

00:15:50.282 --> 00:15:51.992
I'll finally get paid!

00:15:52.076 --> 00:15:54.912
Miss Erika is so kind, Boss V.

00:15:54.995 --> 00:15:56.830
She should really be named Angel.

00:16:00.584 --> 00:16:03.504
Sam,
come with me to Patient Tommy.

00:16:32.032 --> 00:16:34.660
Ma'am, Doc Emman is calling.
It's about Sir Samuel.

00:17:25.502 --> 00:17:27.171
She's really serious, Mia.

00:17:27.254 --> 00:17:29.381
- I read the proposal she sent--
- Good.

00:17:29.465 --> 00:17:32.384
Good? I haven't even
discussed anything yet.

00:17:32.468 --> 00:17:35.137
It's good because I know Erika is rich.

00:17:36.055 --> 00:17:38.682
That's it? Your entire reason
is because she's rich?

00:17:38.766 --> 00:17:41.810
Good for me too because
you'll finally leave Maravida.

00:17:43.479 --> 00:17:44.605
What is this for?

00:17:44.688 --> 00:17:45.981
Let's celebrate.

00:17:46.065 --> 00:17:48.692
I'm finally getting you out of my hair.

00:17:50.903 --> 00:17:51.820
Wait--

00:17:51.904 --> 00:17:53.781
- What?
- Yes.

00:17:53.864 --> 00:17:58.410
You'll go back to Manila
once Erika becomes your partner.

00:17:58.494 --> 00:18:01.705
You should be where your partner is.

00:18:02.331 --> 00:18:05.417
As for me, I'll stay here.

00:18:06.126 --> 00:18:07.628
Because, I'm just a writer.

00:18:10.255 --> 00:18:11.799
So that means…

00:18:12.633 --> 00:18:14.051
…goodbye Maravida for me?

00:18:16.011 --> 00:18:17.012
Cheers.

00:18:20.933 --> 00:18:23.519
No!

00:18:32.694 --> 00:18:34.071
Can you do it, Vincent?

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:36.990
Can you leave Gemma?

00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:58.053
Phil, have you see my phone?

00:18:58.512 --> 00:18:59.638
No, Mama.

00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:01.431
Can you call it?

00:19:09.439 --> 00:19:10.941
The subscriber cannot be reached…

00:19:11.024 --> 00:19:12.025
It's out of reach.

00:19:12.109 --> 00:19:13.318
Lend me yours.

00:19:20.409 --> 00:19:22.411
Hello, Nurse Jenny?

00:19:22.494 --> 00:19:23.871
Yes, this is Eden.

00:19:24.621 --> 00:19:28.917
Can you check my
phone at the nurse's station?

00:19:34.047 --> 00:19:35.174
Not there?

00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:39.595
Maybe it's on the table.
Okay, I'll go check. Thank you.

00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:42.848
I'm going back to the hospital.

00:19:43.223 --> 00:19:44.474
Can't it wait until tomorrow, Ma?

00:19:44.933 --> 00:19:47.686
I need it for an emergency. Alright.

00:20:11.668 --> 00:20:14.004
- Good evening.
- What is it?

00:20:14.546 --> 00:20:17.549
I was going to return Ma'am Eden's phone.

00:20:18.926 --> 00:20:20.219
You just missed her.

00:20:20.302 --> 00:20:22.888
She already went
to the hospital to pick it up.

00:20:23.847 --> 00:20:25.807
I didn't know Ma'am Eden had a son.

00:20:26.642 --> 00:20:27.976
Are you a nurse under Mama?

00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:28.977
Yes.

00:20:29.061 --> 00:20:31.688
I'm a nurse aide. I report to Ma'am Eden.

00:20:31.772 --> 00:20:32.731
Oh.

00:20:33.857 --> 00:20:35.192
Thank you for this.

00:20:35.984 --> 00:20:37.569
Uh, can I get a drink?

00:20:38.028 --> 00:20:39.905
My home is far from here.

00:20:41.365 --> 00:20:42.950
Sure, come in.

00:20:48.247 --> 00:20:51.250
Please, have a seat. Won't be long.

00:21:20.612 --> 00:21:25.826
"When white brightens the dark,
blue signals the coming night.

00:21:25.909 --> 00:21:29.496
Not only do the weavers of dreams appear.

00:21:29.579 --> 00:21:32.499
Also those who loved
even with broken hearts."

00:21:39.464 --> 00:21:42.050
I can't attend the meeting.
Mama will be angry.

00:21:42.134 --> 00:21:43.302
Yeah, bye.

00:21:44.052 --> 00:21:46.471
Sorry, I went through your stuff.

00:21:47.681 --> 00:21:48.724
Did you write this?

00:21:50.684 --> 00:21:51.768
Oh.

00:21:52.311 --> 00:21:54.855
She's at it again. That's mama's.

00:21:56.606 --> 00:21:57.858
Ma'am Eden writes?

00:21:58.608 --> 00:21:59.609
Mm-hmm.

00:21:59.693 --> 00:22:00.819
It's her hobby.

00:22:00.902 --> 00:22:03.113
It's also her hobby to edit all my work.

00:22:08.827 --> 00:22:09.870
Wait a moment.

00:22:09.953 --> 00:22:13.123
Hello? I told Marcus I can't come.

00:22:32.517 --> 00:22:33.477
Pogi?

00:22:34.436 --> 00:22:35.437
Pogi?

00:23:47.217 --> 00:23:50.720
Ma, he arrived as
soon as you left the house.

00:23:51.888 --> 00:23:52.973
Huh?

00:23:54.307 --> 00:23:57.227
Are you sure he's
staff from the hospital?

00:23:57.310 --> 00:23:58.520
Yes, Mama.

00:23:58.603 --> 00:24:01.148
I asked for his ID and he gave it.

00:24:02.149 --> 00:24:03.066
Patrick?

00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:06.528
Patrick, the nursing aide.

00:24:07.404 --> 00:24:09.156
You know him, right?

00:24:56.745 --> 00:24:59.956
"Because dawn brings many things,

00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:04.586
there is mystery, death, and rebirth."

00:25:12.177 --> 00:25:13.470
Is it just me?

00:25:14.137 --> 00:25:15.972
Or is it the same voice?

00:25:17.182 --> 00:25:20.477
It sounds like how Mia's mother writes.

00:25:26.107 --> 00:25:27.400
Could it be her?

00:25:30.278 --> 00:25:32.822
Are Ma'am Eden and
Ingrid the same person?

00:25:39.537 --> 00:25:40.580
Hello, Gemma?

00:25:40.664 --> 00:25:41.873
Patrick.

00:25:41.957 --> 00:25:43.208
Patrick, it's Sir Samuel.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.377
You need to come here.

00:25:45.961 --> 00:25:47.295
What happened to him?

00:25:48.046 --> 00:25:49.714
Sir Samuel is missing.

00:25:50.548 --> 00:25:52.092
Do you know where Mia is?

00:25:52.676 --> 00:25:54.135
Maybe she picked him up.

00:25:54.970 --> 00:25:57.973
That's impossible.
Why would Mia take Sir Samuel?

00:25:58.473 --> 00:26:00.392
He wasn't there when Pogi made rounds.

00:26:00.475 --> 00:26:02.686
They're looking for
him all over the hospital.

00:26:04.938 --> 00:26:07.774
CCTV shows someone leaving with him.

00:26:13.947 --> 00:26:16.533
It's impossible Gemma,
Mia is at home right now.

00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:36.970
Do you know where you are?

00:26:46.604 --> 00:26:48.273
You are at my house.

00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:04.205
Sir Samuel is missing.

00:27:04.289 --> 00:27:06.624
Thank God.
I don't care about him.

00:27:06.708 --> 00:27:08.877
It's like they know every loophole here.

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:10.045
What did you do, Olivia?

00:27:10.128 --> 00:27:11.421
How did it come to this?

00:27:11.504 --> 00:27:13.840
I'll be the last person you ever see.

00:27:15.342 --> 00:27:16.718
That is none of your business.

00:27:16.801 --> 00:27:18.053
What if she comes back?

00:27:18.136 --> 00:27:19.304
What if she is your mother?

00:27:19.387 --> 00:27:20.722
I cannot leave you.

00:27:20.805 --> 00:27:22.932
Because what's inside you,
and what's inside me

00:27:23.016 --> 00:27:25.226
are bound together, forever.
