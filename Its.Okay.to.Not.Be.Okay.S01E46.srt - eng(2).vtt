00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:02.836
- You're the one singing?
- Why?

00:00:02.919 --> 00:00:04.587
Are you going to kill me again?

00:00:04.671 --> 00:00:06.339
You're dead!

00:00:06.423 --> 00:00:08.383
- You're dead already!
- Sir Samuel!

00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:11.136
- What if I kill him?!
- Zelda.

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.431
But what if Zelda is Samuel's real wife?

00:00:14.514 --> 00:00:16.016
That's just my guess.

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:17.892
Happy birthday, Miss Mia!

00:00:17.976 --> 00:00:20.478
Mia, when will this obsession end?

00:00:20.562 --> 00:00:22.355
Why, so I'll go back to Manila?

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.482
So I can get you out of Maravida.

00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:26.943
So you won't be affected
by your past, by your parents.

00:00:27.027 --> 00:00:28.570
I don't want to be with him anymore.

00:00:28.653 --> 00:00:29.988
I want to be with you instead.

00:00:30.071 --> 00:00:31.239
You're a liar.

00:00:31.322 --> 00:00:33.241
- Matmat--
- I don't want the camping van.

00:00:33.324 --> 00:00:34.701
I don't like Mia!

00:01:57.117 --> 00:02:01.246
♪ Happy Birthday to you ♪

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:05.583
♪ Happy Birthday to you ♪

00:02:05.667 --> 00:02:07.168
♪ Happy Birthday… ♪

00:02:07.252 --> 00:02:10.839
Birthdays are special to us mothers.

00:02:10.922 --> 00:02:15.468
We were the first to celebrate,
our child's arrival into the world.

00:02:21.641 --> 00:02:23.143
Go ahead, cut your cake.

00:02:33.027 --> 00:02:34.612
It's beautiful, isn't it?

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:40.493
It's sharp.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.141
Ingrid!

00:03:07.645 --> 00:03:09.230
Mia's already hurt.

00:03:10.857 --> 00:03:12.025
It's nothing.

00:03:14.986 --> 00:03:17.196
Right, Mia?

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:24.954
Go ahead.

00:03:25.872 --> 00:03:26.873
Cut your cake.

00:03:52.106 --> 00:03:54.067
{\an8}-

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.402
{\an8}Good thing you managed to reserve a cake.

00:03:56.486 --> 00:03:57.820
{\an8}There are so many customers today.

00:03:57.904 --> 00:03:58.613
{\an8}Is that so?

00:03:58.696 --> 00:04:00.323
{\an8}I'm lucky then.

00:04:00.406 --> 00:04:01.866
{\an8}Did you write on the dedication?

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.410
{\an8}Yes, ma'am,
"Happy Birthday" as requested.

00:04:04.494 --> 00:04:05.703
{\an8}Who's celebrating?

00:04:07.247 --> 00:04:08.665
{\an8}Uh, my child.

00:04:09.666 --> 00:04:10.708
{\an8}Thank you.

00:04:12.794 --> 00:04:18.424
{\an8}

00:04:30.061 --> 00:04:31.396
{\an8}Oh.

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:32.689
{\an8}Looking good, nurse.

00:04:33.022 --> 00:04:34.315
{\an8}Thank you, doc.

00:04:34.399 --> 00:04:35.650
{\an8}Where are you going?

00:04:35.733 --> 00:04:37.026
{\an8}I'm just meeting someone.

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:38.361
{\an8}Mmm.

00:04:38.444 --> 00:04:39.821
{\an8}A special someone?

00:04:40.363 --> 00:04:42.031
{\an8}

00:04:42.115 --> 00:04:47.620
{\an8}

00:05:01.134 --> 00:05:03.845
{\an8}-

00:05:14.522 --> 00:05:19.861
{\an8}

00:05:47.305 --> 00:05:48.806
Ma'am Ingrid!

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:51.142
Aah!

00:06:09.827 --> 00:06:11.913
Do you need to be taken to the hospital?

00:06:13.748 --> 00:06:14.874
No.

00:06:16.542 --> 00:06:20.338
Uh, maybe
you should report to the police.

00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:22.381
No.

00:08:00.229 --> 00:08:01.314
Um…

00:08:01.397 --> 00:08:02.773
I brought you some food.

00:08:08.779 --> 00:08:10.156
You're still beautiful even if--

00:08:10.239 --> 00:08:13.576
You won't tell
anyone about what happened.

00:08:18.247 --> 00:08:20.583
I'll be back for my daughter.

00:08:21.501 --> 00:08:24.420
And I'll make my husband pay.

00:08:35.348 --> 00:08:36.474
Payment.

00:08:37.683 --> 00:08:38.935
For your silence.

00:08:50.154 --> 00:08:52.573
Ma'am Ingrid,
I've brought a dress for you.

00:08:54.617 --> 00:08:55.868
Ma'am Ingrid?

00:09:00.206 --> 00:09:01.207
Ma'am Ingrid?

00:09:04.794 --> 00:09:05.795
Ma'am Ingrid?

00:09:12.301 --> 00:09:14.011
The swelling…

00:09:15.096 --> 00:09:16.472
and bleeding…

00:09:17.181 --> 00:09:19.559
is expected until around the 14th day.

00:09:19.642 --> 00:09:20.476
Okay?

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.478
That's why you have to be patient.

00:09:22.979 --> 00:09:24.105
Uncle….

00:09:24.897 --> 00:09:26.399
No one should know about this.

00:09:28.651 --> 00:09:30.194
For the meantime,

00:09:30.278 --> 00:09:32.863
you can't move too much, okay?

00:09:33.447 --> 00:09:35.491
And you can't lift anything heavy.

00:09:36.492 --> 00:09:39.954
If you feel pain, just let me know.

00:09:40.413 --> 00:09:42.123
So I can give you a pain reliever.

00:09:43.583 --> 00:09:44.875
Am I still beautiful?

00:09:47.545 --> 00:09:48.546
Are you ready?

00:10:03.269 --> 00:10:04.312
No…

00:10:06.981 --> 00:10:08.190
- No!
- Ingrid?

00:10:11.611 --> 00:10:13.029
No!

00:10:13.112 --> 00:10:15.156
- Aah!
- Don't move, Ingrid!

00:10:15.239 --> 00:10:16.574
This is not me!

00:10:16.657 --> 00:10:18.242
This is not my face!

00:10:18.326 --> 00:10:20.620
- Don't move!
- This is not my face!

00:10:20.703 --> 00:10:21.871
No!

00:10:21.954 --> 00:10:24.040
No! Uncle!

00:10:25.374 --> 00:10:26.792
- This is not me!
- Don't move!

00:10:26.876 --> 00:10:29.754
- Ingrid! Ingrid!
- This is not my--

00:10:29.837 --> 00:10:31.589
Calm down, calm down.

00:10:31.672 --> 00:10:32.632
Calm down, it's okay.

00:10:32.715 --> 00:10:34.967
- No…
- It's okay, it's okay.

00:10:35.051 --> 00:10:36.344
It's okay, it's okay.

00:10:36.427 --> 00:10:37.887
It's okay.

00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:39.138
- No.
- It's okay.

00:10:41.307 --> 00:10:43.142
It's okay, it's okay.

00:10:44.602 --> 00:10:45.728
Pogi, wake up!

00:10:45.811 --> 00:10:46.812
Pogi!

00:10:48.814 --> 00:10:50.191
Oh, Pogi!

00:10:50.274 --> 00:10:51.567
Pogi, wake up!

00:10:52.151 --> 00:10:53.486
Pogi!

00:10:53.569 --> 00:10:56.322
Pogi?

00:10:56.405 --> 00:10:57.365
Patrick!

00:10:57.448 --> 00:10:58.407
What happened?

00:10:58.491 --> 00:11:01.160
I just found him like this.
And look at this.

00:11:06.999 --> 00:11:08.417
This is a sedative.

00:11:08.501 --> 00:11:09.585
Exactly.

00:11:15.466 --> 00:11:16.634
Help me.

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:19.720
Pogi.

00:11:19.804 --> 00:11:21.138
Pogi, what happened?

00:11:25.810 --> 00:11:27.311
Patient Zelda…

00:11:28.687 --> 00:11:30.189
Did she do this?

00:11:35.152 --> 00:11:40.366
I was asking her why
she wasn't in her room.

00:11:40.449 --> 00:11:42.159
Then she injected me with that.

00:11:43.285 --> 00:11:45.121
She didn't say anything to you?

00:11:48.791 --> 00:11:52.628
All I remember is…

00:11:52.711 --> 00:11:55.798
She said this is
an important day for her.

00:11:56.799 --> 00:11:59.385
It's a special day. That's what she said.

00:12:07.059 --> 00:12:08.978
It's my birthday tomorrow.

00:12:09.061 --> 00:12:10.521
Buy me cake.

00:12:10.604 --> 00:12:12.898
Bring me any kind food.

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:16.986
Gemma, give me your keys.

00:12:17.069 --> 00:12:19.071
- What?
- Just give me your keys.

00:12:19.155 --> 00:12:20.322
Where are you going?

00:12:22.158 --> 00:12:23.701
Patrick, you're sick!

00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:07.620
Swimming in the ocean.

00:13:07.703 --> 00:13:09.622
Our overnight stay.
Everything we shared that morning,

00:13:09.705 --> 00:13:10.748
all of that was just a dream.

00:13:10.831 --> 00:13:13.292
We were really in Montanesa together.

00:13:13.375 --> 00:13:14.460
Yes.

00:13:15.044 --> 00:13:16.795
But it's all just a memory now.

00:13:17.379 --> 00:13:19.215
That's it.

00:13:19.298 --> 00:13:21.759
It's wrong that I keep forgetting Matmat.

00:13:22.343 --> 00:13:24.637
It was a mistake that I
ever entertained having you in my life.

00:13:25.804 --> 00:13:27.473
This is the end for us.

00:13:33.854 --> 00:13:36.899
Why does it seem so
easy for you to forget everything?

00:13:42.196 --> 00:13:45.324
The child only did
that because they were sad.

00:13:46.492 --> 00:13:48.661
But what they didn't know was,

00:13:48.744 --> 00:13:52.998
the moment the wolf
came to eat the sheep,

00:13:53.666 --> 00:13:56.043
no one would come to help.

00:13:58.546 --> 00:14:03.551
If only someone believed him,

00:14:04.093 --> 00:14:07.137
maybe they wouldn't have died.

00:14:11.517 --> 00:14:12.977
Patrick?

00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:14.979
Patrick?

00:14:52.474 --> 00:14:54.560
Happy birthday, dear daughter.

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:13.621
I haven't seen the brothers in a while.

00:15:42.107 --> 00:15:43.108
Ingrid.

00:16:50.926 --> 00:16:52.094
You're here.

00:17:41.435 --> 00:17:43.854
Did you let me in because…

00:17:45.272 --> 00:17:48.776
I called you my daughter?

00:17:49.318 --> 00:17:50.444
No.

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:53.155
You're here because you're a fan.

00:17:53.906 --> 00:17:55.574
My fans know my birthday.

00:17:57.910 --> 00:18:03.248
So you don't believe I'm your mother?

00:18:04.917 --> 00:18:07.461
I don't know what's in
the air here in Maravida,

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:11.590
but all the mothers
here call me their daughter.

00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:16.553
So you didn't surprise me.

00:18:17.638 --> 00:18:19.556
I just don't understand why anyone

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:21.725
would want me to be their daughter.

00:18:24.103 --> 00:18:28.065
Because you are
different from them all, Mia.

00:18:34.571 --> 00:18:35.781
Leave.

00:18:38.117 --> 00:18:40.661
So soon? Mm…

00:18:45.541 --> 00:18:51.296
Why don't we cut your cake first?

00:18:53.215 --> 00:18:54.466
Take it with you.

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:58.762
I don't eat food
given to me from strangers.

00:18:59.471 --> 00:19:02.391
I will leave once we're done.

00:19:02.474 --> 00:19:06.728
Go get some plates and cutlery.

00:19:07.312 --> 00:19:10.691
I said… leave.

00:19:11.733 --> 00:19:13.318
I am not leaving.

00:19:14.319 --> 00:19:16.655
Not until we cut the cake.

00:20:30.437 --> 00:20:31.438
Mia?

00:20:33.106 --> 00:20:34.900
Patrick, it's me.

00:20:34.983 --> 00:20:36.401
Are you with Mia?

00:20:36.485 --> 00:20:38.195
No, she went home already.

00:20:38.278 --> 00:20:39.446
Why do you ask?

00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:40.864
I'll tell you later.

00:21:06.682 --> 00:21:10.185
Where are you?

00:21:12.312 --> 00:21:15.232
Where are you?

00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:19.319
Where are you?

00:21:20.988 --> 00:21:22.698
What are you looking for?

00:21:24.032 --> 00:21:25.909
Hmm.

00:21:27.744 --> 00:21:28.912
Mm-hmm.

00:21:32.457 --> 00:21:34.209
This is wilted.

00:21:37.838 --> 00:21:39.548
You should throw it out.

00:21:42.759 --> 00:21:44.011
You're nosy.

00:21:45.012 --> 00:21:46.722
I just noticed.

00:21:47.556 --> 00:21:49.558
What are you really doing here?

00:21:50.434 --> 00:21:52.311
It's your birthday.

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:54.604
And so?

00:21:55.355 --> 00:21:59.860
I just thought maybe you're sad.

00:22:02.654 --> 00:22:04.823
- Leave.
- Hmm.

00:22:12.122 --> 00:22:13.749
Come out.

00:22:15.542 --> 00:22:16.918
I need you now.

00:22:19.755 --> 00:22:21.256
You're mine now.

00:22:24.009 --> 00:22:25.177
You're mine now.

00:22:42.986 --> 00:22:44.613
Aah…

00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:00.045
Did you know…

00:23:01.004 --> 00:23:04.007
your father almost killed me?

00:23:09.096 --> 00:23:10.722
He strangled me.

00:23:14.267 --> 00:23:15.477
And so?

00:23:16.561 --> 00:23:17.687
"Monster."

00:23:19.898 --> 00:23:22.484
That's what he called me.

00:23:24.361 --> 00:23:26.154
He said I'm a monster.

00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:29.032
He said his daughter is a monster.

00:23:29.783 --> 00:23:34.913
And all monsters must die.

00:23:37.124 --> 00:23:38.458
So, what?

00:23:39.334 --> 00:23:40.710
So?

00:23:44.256 --> 00:23:46.258
Doesn't it hurt?

00:23:48.176 --> 00:23:51.263
You're his daughter,
but that's how he sees you.

00:23:52.764 --> 00:23:53.932
Why do you care?

00:23:57.978 --> 00:24:00.689
I worry about you, Mia.

00:24:03.984 --> 00:24:05.068
Really?

00:24:05.152 --> 00:24:06.570
Mm.

00:24:06.987 --> 00:24:08.113
Why?

00:24:09.865 --> 00:24:11.449
Isn't it sad?

00:24:12.742 --> 00:24:17.789
On your birthday,
that's what he thought of doing…

00:24:22.544 --> 00:24:25.005
Killing you.

00:24:28.425 --> 00:24:30.468
The hell I care.

00:24:31.344 --> 00:24:33.305
Ah…

00:24:33.388 --> 00:24:34.598
It's nothing to you?

00:24:39.936 --> 00:24:42.439
- Should I care?
- Shouldn't you?

00:24:45.609 --> 00:24:48.820
I'm worried about you.

00:24:50.197 --> 00:24:51.948
I'm not buying that.

00:24:54.034 --> 00:24:56.786
[music becomes foreboding

00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:59.080
Don't meddle with what's not yours.

00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:11.343
I guess we're the same.

00:25:11.426 --> 00:25:16.723
I also hate it when
people touch my things.

00:25:18.308 --> 00:25:20.352
Then why are you doing this?

00:25:25.523 --> 00:25:28.235
Because why not?

00:25:42.832 --> 00:25:47.796
A mother never forgets
the day she gave birth to her child.

00:25:48.296 --> 00:25:51.132
Happy birthday, to you.

00:25:51.216 --> 00:25:53.260
Aah!

00:25:55.262 --> 00:25:57.013
Mia?! Mia!

00:26:00.433 --> 00:26:01.518
Didn't I teach you to share?

00:26:01.601 --> 00:26:05.647
No. If I give,
they'll take everything from me.

00:26:06.189 --> 00:26:07.732
Happy birthday.

00:26:07.816 --> 00:26:09.859
Best birthday gift ever.
