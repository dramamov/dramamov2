[Fated Hearts]

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.940
[Episode 18]

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.790
Your Highness.

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:07.650
Your Highness.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:17.460
Ning Fei...

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:19.430
is gone.

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:22.810
Impossible.

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:24.870
How could that be?

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.450
He was fine when I saw him in prison.

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:27.980
That's what Yixiao told me.

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:32.610
But I think Yixiao

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:33.870
might have been lying,

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:35.520
because Ning Fei was gravely injured

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.380
by people sent by Empress Zhuang.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.050
If anything had happened to him,

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:40.000
given Yixiao's temper,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.030
she would have turned Yujing City

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.150
upside down.

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.770
There's no way she'd be this calm.

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.120
The fact that the Three Heroes of Jinxiu

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.250
ended up like this

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:49.840
was all my fault.

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.120
I insisted on getting rid of Yixiao.

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:03.080
Send some people

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:04.430
to quietly look into

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:05.830
Ning Fei's whereabouts.

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.520
Yes.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:25.530
How is she?

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:27.829
What do you mean?

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:29.150
What do you think?

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:30.430
You didn't listen to me.

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:31.910
I told you not to use force,
but you did anyway.

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.079
And now you're asking me how it is?

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:34.630
Don't you know the answer yourself?

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:35.280
Lord Ling,

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.000
the situation was urgent at the time.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.630
I didn't think it through.

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.710
She got hurt because of

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.290
your urgent situation?

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:46.280
Father,

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.000
this isn't the time for such talk.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.400
Hurry and check Yixiao's injury.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.190
Don't I need to understand the situation?

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.960
Can it be as easy

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:52.750
as you say?

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.870
Can a solution really be

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.070
that easy to think of?

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.860
I've actually thought of a solution.

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:00.190
Father,

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:01.630
what solution? Tell us.

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.140
Don't keep us in suspense.

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.800
Alright.

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:05.430
But I don't dare

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:06.640
use it lightly.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.630
It's not as simple
as treating muscle and bone injuries.

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:11.360
It's like scraping the bone
to remove the poison.

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.120
Scraping the bone?

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.329
We need to cut through the flesh here

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:19.860
to repair the meridians.

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:20.800
If all goes well,

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.390
she'll recover full mobility.

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:23.120
If not,

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:25.390
she'll be crippled for life.

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:26.870
Cutting through the flesh?

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:27.870
Wouldn't that make the injury even worse?

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:29.130
What do you know?

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.950
Her injury is in the meridians and bones.

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:32.000
You think a bit of ointment on the skin

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.510
would heal it?

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:38.100
Miss,

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:39.360
don't worry.

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:40.750
After taking the anesthetic,

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.409
you'll just sleep through it.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:43.720
But it will hurt a lot

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:45.850
when you wake up.

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:49.080
No.

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:50.350
Think of another way.

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:52.070
It's alright.

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.070
I trust you.

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:47.159
The First Prince let the princess

00:06:47.159 --> 00:06:49.360
and her husband go without permission.

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:50.870
Perhaps

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:54.350
he has been secretly in contact
with Jinxiu.

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:57.020
The Prince Consort's
returning to his country

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:59.280
is understandable.

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:01.810
He could have reported it to you.

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:04.360
You wouldn't have refused his request.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.330
Prime Minister Zhuang.

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.530
Don't you have anything to say?

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.430
This matter seems suspicious.

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:18.040
We should wait for the First Prince
to return

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.900
and explain everything clearly.

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:21.650
Has the First Prince returned?

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:24.510
Your Majesty,

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:27.390
he entered the city early this morning.

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.490
He's back in the capital

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:32.150
but hasn't come to report?

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:35.200
Summon him to the palace immediately!

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:36.120
Yes.

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:53.690
Your Highness,

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:55.950
His Majesty summoned you to the palace.

00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:58.510
Greetings, Your Highness.

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:03.830
How is she?

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:07.390
She won't die.

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:13.820
This...

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:15.190
His Highness

00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:16.600
has some affairs to attend to.

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:18.160
Sir, please wait a moment.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:53.860
Your Highness,

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:55.710
the palace attendant is waiting for you.

00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:56.820
Tell him to wait.

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:01.320
I'll personally apologize
to His Majesty afterward.

00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:23.670
Your Majesty,

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:26.520
shall we discuss it tomorrow?

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:28.870
When will he arrive?

00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:39.960
Where is His Highness?

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:41.720
That female general of Jinxiu is injured.

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:43.750
Stop whispering.

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:47.670
Just tell me directly.

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:51.350
Your Majesty,

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:52.600
His Highness...

00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:53.960
Tell me.

00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:58.880
Say it right there!

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:02.480
His Highness is handling urgent matters
at his residence

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:05.140
and cannot respond to your summon
immediately.

00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:09.360
Cannot respond to my summon?

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:11.360
Didn't you ask him

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:14.100
what matter in this world could be

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:16.410
more important than seeing His Majesty?

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:19.720
Your Majesty!

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:20.480
The...

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:21.750
female general of Jinxiu
at First Prince's Residence

00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:23.350
has been seriously injured.

00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:26.800
The First Prince is staying by her side
to watch over her.

00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:07.010
Her left arm must not be moved,

00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:09.090
and her shoulder wound must stay dry.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.060
Thank you for this,

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:12.770
Young Mistress.

00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:14.670
You should thank my father.

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:15.800
In all my life,

00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:17.200
I've only seen him perform

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:19.360
this meridian restoration technique twice.

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:20.760
It takes immense effort.

00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:22.050
After today,

00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:23.840
he'll probably need several days

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:25.440
to fully recover his energy.

00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:27.370
I'll remember this favor.

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:29.360
Don't mention it.

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:31.440
Just take good care of my sister.

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:34.040
There's still a risk
of permanent disability.

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:24.060
Mr. Ma came personally.

00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:30.640
What?

00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:33.080
Was he afraid I wouldn't follow the order,

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:35.140
so he sent you to drag me to the palace?

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:36.720
This is no joke this time.

00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:38.640
Be careful when you talk to him.

00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:44.230
Thank you for your trouble, Mr. Ma.

00:12:58.310 --> 00:12:59.770
His Majesty didn't sleep all night,

00:12:59.770 --> 00:13:00.600
and today in the hall

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:01.810
he was truly angered.

00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:02.960
Only because of
the court officials' presence

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:04.360
did he restrain himself.

00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:05.790
Your Highness, please be understanding.

00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:07.020
His Majesty is getting on in years.

00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:08.440
Just let him scold you a bit

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:09.360
and don't argue with him,

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:11.090
or you'll make him angry again.

00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:16.990
[Zichen Hall]

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:19.550
Since Prince of Zhennan arrived,

00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:21.440
His Majesty has lost
his appetite and sleep—

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:22.970
truly wearing himself out.

00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:23.870
I see.

00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:30.120
[Zichen Hall]

00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:05.830
I, Feng Suige,

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:08.090
pay my respects to His Majesty.

00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:12.020
Rise.

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:13.630
I am guilty.

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:17.920
Your Majesty, please punish me.

00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:26.870
Rise and speak.

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:36.250
When Xiyang was seven,

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:37.790
she accompanied me on an incognito tour.

00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:38.450
I don't know

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:40.150
which rascal

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:41.360
she got this from.

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:43.960
She treasured it immensely.

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:46.870
She cherished it

00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:48.670
far more than
all her gem- and pearl-encrusted

00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:50.080
trinkets.

00:14:54.510 --> 00:14:56.550
Are you resenting me?

00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:59.020
I failed to bring Xiyang back,

00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:01.720
so I deserve punishment.

00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:05.670
I told you to rise,

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:08.010
yet you're still kneeling?

00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:10.270
Stand up!

00:15:24.510 --> 00:15:26.440
Xiyang has always been thoughtful

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:28.080
since she was a child.

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:31.640
I injured my shoulder years ago.

00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:33.050
She knows that

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:36.000
whenever it rains,
my old injury flares up,

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.080
and my shoulder aches unbearably.

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:42.320
So whenever it rains,

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:44.080
she comes to keep me company,

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:46.510
bringing candies

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:48.030
and talking with me

00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:49.790
to cheer me up.

00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:52.790
People say

00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:54.390
daughters will eventually

00:15:54.390 --> 00:15:56.190
marry into someone else's home.

00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:59.050
But Xiyang wrapped her arms around my neck

00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:02.330
and said she'd never marry

00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:04.730
and that she'd always be my daughter.

00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:10.000
All lies.

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:35.910
My son and daughter…

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:39.000
My daughter eloped,

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:41.320
and my son...

00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:44.670
actually defied my imperial decree

00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:47.720
for a woman.

00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:57.570
Fu Yixiao was gravely injured

00:16:57.670 --> 00:16:58.870
saving me.

00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:00.960
Your Majesty, when your decree arrived,

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:02.480
she was at a critical moment.

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:03.810
I couldn't abandon her.

00:17:05.349 --> 00:17:06.550
And to me,

00:17:07.589 --> 00:17:09.680
she isn't just any woman.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.310
She is the woman
I'm willing to stay with for life,

00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:15.000
never leaving nor forsaking.

00:17:27.349 --> 00:17:29.080
I've already lost my daughter.

00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:30.920
I don't want

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:33.000
to lose a son as well.

00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:36.070
Fortunately, our dynasty has a rule—

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:37.960
princes

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:41.770
have no saying in their own marriages.

00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:43.110
I know.

00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:46.700
Then why do you still talk to me this way?

00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:47.510
Your Majesty,

00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:48.680
you won't lose a son.

00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:50.880
After all, Chengyang is filial.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.740
He has never defied you.

00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:07.910
You failed to bring Xiyang back.

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:10.160
Tomorrow at court,

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:12.130
the officials will surely give you
a hard time.

00:18:12.130 --> 00:18:13.350
Hou Jing has already gone to

00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:15.070
the Capital Garrison for inspection,

00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:17.730
and there will be no one in court
to speak for you.

00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:20.720
You'd better be fully prepared to face

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:23.290
their attacks and criticism in court.

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:28.840
All right. You may go now.

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:30.440
Go back to

00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:32.400
your female general of Jinxiu.

00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:34.140
From now on,

00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:36.250
do whatever you want.

00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:38.190
No one will stop you anymore.

00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:43.860
Then, Your Majesty, why did you

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:45.400
summon me today?

00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:49.110
Before Xiyang's wedding,

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:52.400
I prepared her a lavish dowry—

00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:54.990
all her favorite things.

00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:57.040
She left in a hurry this time

00:18:57.750 --> 00:18:59.160
and couldn't take it with her.

00:18:59.160 --> 00:18:59.830
Later,

00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:02.760
have someone deliver it to her.

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:07.400
My daughter

00:19:08.030 --> 00:19:09.560
will always be my daughter,

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:12.100
no matter whom she marries

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:14.750
or where she goes.

00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:19.790
Go now.

00:20:48.510 --> 00:20:49.110
Yixiao.

00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:50.960
Don't move.

00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:53.570
You're finally awake.

00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:55.070
Once your meridians heal,

00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:57.070
your injury will be completely cured.

00:20:57.070 --> 00:20:58.600
That's what my father said.

00:20:59.070 --> 00:20:59.800
Don't worry.

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:01.320
Thank you.

00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:07.400
Where is Feng Suige?

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:08.880
He went to the palace.

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:11.110
You were unconscious,
so you didn't see it.

00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:11.920
Today, for you,

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:13.550
he defied the imperial order.

00:21:13.550 --> 00:21:15.280
I used to be biased against him,

00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:17.440
but today I've completely changed my view.

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:18.160
Sister,

00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:20.610
you were so badly injured for Feng Suige.

00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:21.640
Your love

00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:22.720
will not be in vain.

00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:25.580
He defied the imperial order?

00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:40.870
Your Majesty.

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:48.200
You've had a long day.

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:50.300
Please go back and rest early.

00:21:50.550 --> 00:21:51.110
Alright.

00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:03.160
Your Majesty!

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:03.760
It's fine.

00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:06.200
Your Majesty!

00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:07.070
[Zichen Hall]

00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:08.030
Your Majesty!

00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:28.350
Summon Prime Minister Zhuang
to the palace.

00:22:28.350 --> 00:22:29.000
Yes!

00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:31.480
[Zichen Hall]

00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:42.830
[Zichen Hall]

00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:45.480
In a few days,
the wound will start to itch.

00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:47.480
You must resist the urge to touch it.

00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:49.000
Also,

00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:50.200
the dressing needs to be changed

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:51.200
every day.

00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:57.970
You two talk.

00:22:58.240 --> 00:22:59.900
I'll go prepare the medicine.

00:23:10.790 --> 00:23:11.590
You're awake?

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:13.610
I heard from Xueying

00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:16.200
that you defied the imperial order for me.

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:17.260
Were you punished?

00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:20.890
Does it hurt?

00:23:22.270 --> 00:23:22.960
No.

00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:24.920
How could it not hurt?

00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:28.550
You need to change the dressing every day,

00:23:28.550 --> 00:23:29.170
right?

00:23:29.850 --> 00:23:30.850
I'll do it for you.

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:31.750
Okay.

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:33.760
It's fine now.

00:23:34.510 --> 00:23:35.710
From now on,

00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:37.830
I'll be your left hand.

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:40.350
Of course you can be

00:23:40.350 --> 00:23:41.110
my left hand.

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:42.590
But you have

00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:44.190
more important things to do.

00:23:45.070 --> 00:23:46.630
I'm not some fragile woman.

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:48.550
This is nothing.

00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:50.750
Yixiao,

00:23:53.070 --> 00:23:54.680
things are different now.

00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:56.510
In front of me,

00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:59.110
you don't need to put on a brave face.

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:06.860
Who's putting on a brave face?

00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:07.480
Look.

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:11.830
Don't move.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.240
See? It's fine.

00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:16.770
Lord Ling truly is a miraculous doctor.

00:24:16.770 --> 00:24:18.430
The wound is healing quickly.

00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:19.550
By tomorrow,

00:24:19.550 --> 00:24:21.150
this bandage can be removed.

00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:24.710
But you still need to follow instructions.

00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:27.030
Don't worry.

00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:28.640
It's fine.

00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:33.100
Your Highness.

00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:40.100
I promise I won't move around.

00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:41.750
Go take care of your business.

00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:43.410
I'll wait for you to come back.

00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:44.720
Get some good rest.

00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:52.510
Bad news from the palace.

00:25:00.030 --> 00:25:00.790
Lord Ling.

00:25:04.270 --> 00:25:04.960
Lord Ling.

00:25:09.070 --> 00:25:10.000
I've been busy

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.750
all day for you.

00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:14.250
I'm sleeping now. Get out!

00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:15.730
You must

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:17.560
help me with this matter.

00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:23.410
I must have owed you in my past life.

00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:25.510
What could you possibly need me for?

00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:27.210
Either treating your wounds

00:25:27.210 --> 00:25:28.750
or helping you save someone's life.

00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:31.270
Let's go.
Don't waste time. Tell me on the way.

00:25:31.270 --> 00:25:31.870
Thank you.

00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:33.360
My medicine box!

00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:34.410
And my shoes!

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:03.420
It's been over an hour.

00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:04.830
Has no one figured out

00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:06.580
what illness His Majesty has?

00:26:07.550 --> 00:26:08.970
How is His Majesty now?

00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:10.110
Your Majesty,

00:26:10.590 --> 00:26:12.110
His Majesty suffered
a sudden surge of anger,

00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:14.040
which caused him to cough up blood.

00:26:14.270 --> 00:26:14.790
But...

00:26:15.590 --> 00:26:16.930
But logically,

00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:19.690
he should've regained consciousness
by now.

00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:21.350
Then why hasn't he?

00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:22.830
Well...

00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:26.000
What should we do?

00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:30.500
Your Majesty.

00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:31.440
Prime Minister Zhuang.

00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:32.790
His Majesty is blessed with great fortune.

00:26:32.790 --> 00:26:34.050
He will surely be fine.

00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:36.000
Your Majesty, please don't worry.

00:26:42.790 --> 00:26:43.790
In the current situation,

00:26:43.790 --> 00:26:45.200
we must not panic.

00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:47.550
Father, are you saying...

00:26:47.550 --> 00:26:48.440
We must prepare

00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:49.770
for all possibilities.

00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:51.880
The most pressing matter now

00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:53.880
is to immediately contain this news

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.860
and keep everyone away from here—

00:26:56.550 --> 00:26:57.960
especially Feng Suige.

00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:01.880
I will stay here for the next few days

00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:03.310
and watch over His Majesty with you.

00:27:03.310 --> 00:27:04.960
The entire Imperial Hospital staff
are all our people.

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:06.270
You can rest assured.

00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:10.440
Physician Xu.

00:27:14.830 --> 00:27:15.590
Your Majesty.

00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:16.350
Prime Minister Zhuang.

00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:17.150
Physician Xu,

00:27:17.590 --> 00:27:18.980
you were personally selected
by Prime Minister Zhuang

00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:20.440
and promoted
to head of the Imperial Hospital.

00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:22.170
You are our trusted confidant.

00:27:22.330 --> 00:27:23.790
You must keep a close watch

00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:25.270
on His Majesty's condition

00:27:25.270 --> 00:27:26.220
without any negligence.

00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:27.240
Please rest assured, Your Majesty.

00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:28.270
I understand.

00:27:45.550 --> 00:27:46.410
Your Highness.

00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:50.350
[Zichen Hall]

00:27:50.350 --> 00:27:52.080
Where are the Imperial Guards?

00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:54.810
Where is Murong Yao?

00:27:56.030 --> 00:27:56.720
Suige!

00:27:59.950 --> 00:28:00.880
What's going on?

00:28:01.030 --> 00:28:01.760
I don't know.

00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:02.510
I was suddenly summoned

00:28:02.510 --> 00:28:04.160
to guard His Majesty's chambers.

00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:05.090
The order from inside

00:28:05.090 --> 00:28:06.480
is that no one is allowed to enter.

00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:07.740
Who issued that order?

00:28:09.030 --> 00:28:09.760
The Empress.

00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:14.740
[Zichen Hall]

00:28:22.270 --> 00:28:22.830
[Zichen Hall]

00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:23.880
His Majesty said

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.550
he doesn't want to see anyone right now.

00:28:25.550 --> 00:28:26.880
Falsely claiming to speak
on His Majesty's behalf

00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:28.310
is punishable by death.

00:28:28.590 --> 00:28:30.450
Even the Empress is no exception.

00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:31.520
First Prince,

00:28:32.430 --> 00:28:34.790
the imperial physicians say
His Majesty needs rest.

00:28:34.790 --> 00:28:37.000
This is Lord Ling from Zhengnian Villa.

00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:39.030
Among all the physicians in the world,

00:28:39.030 --> 00:28:40.160
if his medical skill ranks second,

00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:41.440
no one dares claim to be first.

00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:42.570
Zhengnian Villa?

00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:43.720
Lord Ling?

00:28:44.270 --> 00:28:45.830
There are plenty of physicians
in the Imperial Hospital,

00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:47.550
each with exceptional skills.

00:28:47.550 --> 00:28:49.270
We don't need
a wandering physician interfering.

00:28:49.270 --> 00:28:51.730
Those physicians of your Imperial Hospital

00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:54.380
aren't even qualified
to be my apprentices.

00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:56.070
Lord Ling,

00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:58.240
this is the imperial palace,

00:28:58.240 --> 00:28:59.810
not your Zhengnian Villa.

00:29:00.030 --> 00:29:00.920
And His Majesty isn't like

00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:02.400
the villagers you treat every day

00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:03.530
at Zhengnian Villa.

00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:05.310
His Majesty suddenly fell ill.

00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:06.110
I specifically brought in

00:29:06.110 --> 00:29:08.370
the best doctor in the world to treat him.

00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:10.750
Yet tonight,
the Empress and Prime Minister Zhuang

00:29:10.750 --> 00:29:12.750
are obstructing us at every turn.

00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:15.940
What exactly are your intentions?

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:17.330
Don't try to slander us.

00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:19.270
His Majesty was fine

00:29:19.270 --> 00:29:20.330
before seeing you.

00:29:20.550 --> 00:29:22.310
After meeting you, he fell ill.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:23.720
And you have the nerve

00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:25.320
to come here and question us?

00:29:29.790 --> 00:29:30.550
I don't want to

00:29:30.550 --> 00:29:32.480
waste time arguing with you today.

00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:34.210
I'll say this one last time—

00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:36.480
get out of my way.

00:29:42.110 --> 00:29:43.940
[Zichen Hall]

00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:46.200
Lord Ling!

00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:51.740
Lord Ling,

00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:53.090
please come in quickly!

00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:54.830
Mr. Ma,

00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:56.740
what are you doing?

00:29:57.440 --> 00:29:58.680
Your Highness may not be aware,

00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:00.030
but Lord Ling comes to the palace annually

00:30:00.030 --> 00:30:01.440
to examine His Majesty's health.

00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:03.300
He is someone His Majesty trusts.

00:30:04.510 --> 00:30:05.200
Lord Ling.

00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:14.780
Thank you.

00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:16.600
After you.

00:30:23.070 --> 00:30:24.030
Father, are you aware

00:30:24.030 --> 00:30:25.590
that Lord Ling comes to examine

00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:27.450
His Majesty's health every year?

00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:50.270
Keep a close eye on the people

00:30:50.270 --> 00:30:51.160
the First Prince brought.

00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:51.590
Yes,

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:52.800
Your Majesty.

00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:55.350
Lord Ling's medical skills
are extraordinary.

00:30:55.350 --> 00:30:56.450
We are just

00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:58.140
his juniors.

00:30:58.350 --> 00:30:59.630
With Lord Ling here,

00:30:59.790 --> 00:31:01.830
His Majesty's illness can be cured.

00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:03.280
Your Majesty,

00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:05.240
you can rest assured now.

00:31:12.830 --> 00:31:13.890
What are you doing?

00:31:15.510 --> 00:31:16.200
Lord Ling,

00:31:16.550 --> 00:31:17.680
His Majesty's pulse

00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:18.680
is floating and weak.

00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:19.750
The left cun position

00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:21.590
shows signs
of overexertion and blood deficiency.

00:31:21.590 --> 00:31:22.590
He's the Emperor—

00:31:23.030 --> 00:31:26.020
what Emperor isn't overexerted
and blood-deficient?

00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:27.850
Why do you look familiar to me?

00:31:28.350 --> 00:31:29.320
You remember me?

00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:30.300
Ten years ago,

00:31:30.350 --> 00:31:31.440
at Zhengnian Villa,

00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:32.070
I studied pulse diagnosis

00:31:32.070 --> 00:31:33.470
from you for a few months.

00:31:34.830 --> 00:31:35.800
I see.

00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:38.600
Don't mention this to anyone
in the future.

00:31:40.550 --> 00:31:41.290
Lord Ling,

00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:43.680
earlier, we applied acupuncture
to His Majesty's Governing Vessel

00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:46.030
using the Lingshu acupuncture technique.

00:31:46.030 --> 00:31:47.200
Lord Ling,

00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:48.880
was that appropriate?

00:31:49.510 --> 00:31:50.070
Yes.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:51.930
Of course it was.

00:31:53.310 --> 00:31:55.370
This treatment would be appropriate

00:31:55.510 --> 00:31:57.580
for just anyone.

00:31:57.750 --> 00:31:59.030
It's just a safety method—

00:31:59.030 --> 00:32:00.110
neither helpful nor harmful.

00:32:00.110 --> 00:32:02.640
It won't save him,
but it won't kill him either.

00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:03.350
Ma Qiming.

00:32:04.110 --> 00:32:06.510
There are too many people here.
The air is stale.

00:32:06.510 --> 00:32:07.880
Even healthy people would fall ill.

00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:08.740
Clear the room.

00:32:08.750 --> 00:32:09.440
Lord Ling.

00:32:10.550 --> 00:32:11.680
I won't disturb you.

00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:13.590
Please allow me to stay

00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:15.190
and observe your treatment.

00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:17.070
Your Emperor fell ill

00:32:17.110 --> 00:32:18.960
just so you could learn from it?

00:32:21.830 --> 00:32:22.880
Get out!

00:32:24.310 --> 00:32:26.510
The imperial physicians cannot leave.

00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:29.480
How can we entrust His Majesty's life

00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:31.030
entirely to you alone?

00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:34.990
Then ask them

00:32:35.550 --> 00:32:37.000
if they dare to speak

00:32:37.270 --> 00:32:38.930
while I'm treating patients.

00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:41.550
Your Majesty,

00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:43.290
Lord Ling is right.

00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:44.070
It would be better

00:32:44.070 --> 00:32:45.640
if there were fewer people here

00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:46.550
and more quiet.

00:33:00.070 --> 00:33:01.640
When I perform acupuncture,

00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:03.240
I don't like to be disturbed.

00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:04.480
Please leave, you three.

00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:05.160
No!

00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:09.790
I must stay by His Majesty's side.

00:33:14.890 --> 00:33:15.780
Guards!

00:33:16.790 --> 00:33:18.920
Escort Her Majesty back to her palace.

00:33:22.790 --> 00:33:23.750
Leave!

00:33:26.270 --> 00:33:27.100
First Prince,

00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:28.400
do you still see me

00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:29.350
as the Empress?

00:33:29.790 --> 00:33:32.250
I only care about His Majesty's
well-being.

00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:34.050
How ridiculous.

00:33:34.550 --> 00:33:35.920
I've never seen you

00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:37.440
show such filial devotion before.

00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:38.590
Are you leaving or not?

00:33:38.590 --> 00:33:39.720
What if I don't?

00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:54.640
Please calm down, Your Majesty.

00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:55.350
The First Prince

00:33:55.350 --> 00:33:56.960
is just concerned
about His Majesty's illness.

00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:58.240
No matter what, Lord Ling is

00:33:58.240 --> 00:33:59.480
the best physician in the world.

00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:01.160
He is familiar with His Majesty's
medical history.

00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:02.440
With him treating His Majesty,

00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:04.310
you and the Prime Minister
need not worry too much.

00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:05.200
Besides,

00:34:05.550 --> 00:34:06.920
I am here.

00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:11.880
Your Highness,

00:34:12.070 --> 00:34:14.260
why don't you step outside first?

00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:18.630
Since everyone is here

00:34:18.630 --> 00:34:19.590
for His Majesty's illness,

00:34:19.590 --> 00:34:20.510
let's not keep Lord Ling

00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:22.110
and His Majesty waiting any longer.

00:34:22.110 --> 00:34:23.440
Everything is for His Majesty.

00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:25.190
Everything is for Susha.

00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:31.000
Then I'll trouble you, Lord Ling.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:31.730
Don't worry.

00:34:47.810 --> 00:34:48.280
[Zichen Hall]

00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:49.010
Today,

00:34:49.070 --> 00:34:51.000
what exactly did you say to His Majesty?

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:51.920
Why did he fall gravely ill

00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:53.120
right after you left?

00:35:01.510 --> 00:35:03.510
This isn't the time to assign blame.

00:35:03.630 --> 00:35:05.760
Let's wait until His Majesty wakes up.

00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:07.680
First Prince,

00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:08.980
please go back now.

00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:10.800
I will stay here.

00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:17.650
Go and get Chengyang here.

00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:19.530
He's also a prince.

00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:22.190
He should be just as filial.

00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:23.550
Alright.

00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:55.370
You're worried about Feng Suige?

00:35:57.150 --> 00:35:58.680
Drink your medicine first.

00:36:00.110 --> 00:36:00.710
Here.

00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:09.400
Isn't it bitter?

00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:13.880
It's not that the medicine isn't bitter.

00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:16.010
It's just that your mind is elsewhere.

00:36:16.030 --> 00:36:16.590
I wonder what exactly happened

00:36:16.590 --> 00:36:17.920
in the palace.

00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:20.090
He didn't look well today.

00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:22.090
Worrying like this all day

00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:23.940
isn't good for your recovery.

00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:25.690
Come out with me tomorrow.

00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:26.880
We can bring Fang and Shunzi

00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:27.510
along.

00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:29.110
They haven't seen you for days

00:36:29.110 --> 00:36:31.240
and they're really worried about you.

00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:33.360
With my hand like this, can I go out?

00:36:34.070 --> 00:36:35.630
Not with anyone else—

00:36:37.070 --> 00:36:38.530
but you have me, don't you?

00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:40.190
Alright.

00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:42.780
I'll listen to the medical fairy.

00:36:52.230 --> 00:36:52.920
Chengyang,

00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:55.070
aren't you tired from standing so long?

00:36:55.070 --> 00:36:56.600
Come have something to eat.

00:36:56.630 --> 00:36:57.550
I'm not tired.

00:36:58.440 --> 00:36:59.500
I have no appetite.

00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:04.150
Suige,

00:37:05.150 --> 00:37:05.880
Father...

00:37:07.230 --> 00:37:09.160
won't really be in danger, will he?

00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:10.360
With Lord Ling here,

00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:12.500
His Majesty will wake up.

00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:20.060
[Zichen Hall]

00:37:24.620 --> 00:37:27.610
[Zichen Hall]

00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:29.930
It's already 1 AM.

00:37:30.110 --> 00:37:32.360
Please go back and get some rest,
everyone.

00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:33.000
No.

00:37:33.370 --> 00:37:34.750
I will stay here.

00:37:35.590 --> 00:37:36.480
After His Majesty wakes up,

00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:37.840
he will need you to tend to him.

00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:39.770
You must not exhaust yourself now.

00:37:40.030 --> 00:37:41.640
Mr. Ma is right.

00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:44.280
Your Majesty,
you've been exhausted all day.

00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:45.810
You should go back and rest.

00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:48.670
His Majesty is gravely ill
and unable to attend court.

00:37:48.670 --> 00:37:50.630
I will return to court immediately

00:37:50.710 --> 00:37:52.150
to handle all affairs

00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:53.740
to prevent any unrest.

00:37:54.550 --> 00:37:55.680
If there's any news,

00:37:55.710 --> 00:37:56.670
Mr. Ma, please

00:37:56.710 --> 00:37:58.440
send word to me at once.

00:37:59.070 --> 00:37:59.670
Yes.

00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:03.180
Your Highnesses, please go back as well.

00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:08.230
I'll stay here with my brother.

00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:11.740
Mother, Grandfather,

00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:13.590
please rest early.

00:38:29.730 --> 00:38:33.590
[Zichen Hall]

00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:42.550
[Zichen Hall]

00:38:48.110 --> 00:38:48.710
How is he?

00:38:50.070 --> 00:38:50.800
Don't worry.

00:38:51.150 --> 00:38:52.680
With me here, he'll be fine.

00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:55.330
When will His Majesty wake up?

00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:57.960
I still need
to give him acupuncture today.

00:38:57.960 --> 00:38:59.160
You two have been here all night.

00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:00.420
You should go back now.

00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:05.480
Neither of you will leave, right?

00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:06.010
Fine.

00:39:06.070 --> 00:39:08.070
You'll be in charge of the acupuncture,

00:39:08.070 --> 00:39:09.930
and you'll feed him his medicine.

00:39:10.070 --> 00:39:11.130
I'm going back now.

00:39:12.570 --> 00:39:13.230
Lord Ling.

00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:14.630
Lord Ling is right.

00:39:15.710 --> 00:39:16.320
You two have been here

00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:17.190
all night.

00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:18.400
Go back and get some rest.

00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:19.130
I'll be here.

00:39:24.230 --> 00:39:25.280
Besides treating his illness,

00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:25.920
please also keep a close watch

00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:27.070
on His Majesty's safety,

00:39:27.070 --> 00:39:28.960
in case someone tries to do something.

00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:29.760
Rest assured.

00:39:30.670 --> 00:39:31.710
If anything happens,

00:39:31.710 --> 00:39:33.910
send someone to inform me immediately.

00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:35.580
Don't worry.

00:39:35.610 --> 00:39:37.010
Go back and get some rest.

00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:47.330
I'll see you out of the palace,
Your Highness.

00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:54.500
I'm hungry.

00:39:55.230 --> 00:39:56.710
I'll prepare some food for you right away.

00:39:56.710 --> 00:39:57.770
I want lots of meat.

00:40:04.630 --> 00:40:05.710
Red drum.

00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:09.210
How about this one?

00:40:09.510 --> 00:40:11.150
Slow down. Be careful.

00:40:12.710 --> 00:40:13.420
Sister,

00:40:13.590 --> 00:40:15.390
what are you planning to do next?

00:40:15.410 --> 00:40:16.680
I asked you before

00:40:16.710 --> 00:40:18.590
to go back to Zhengnian Villa with me.

00:40:18.590 --> 00:40:20.050
Have you thought about it?

00:40:20.980 --> 00:40:22.420
I can't leave yet.

00:40:22.670 --> 00:40:24.520
We haven't found Meng Junran.

00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:26.550
I can help Feng Suige if I stay.

00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:28.110
But I think

00:40:28.190 --> 00:40:28.960
you should think about

00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:29.890
your own future.

00:40:30.070 --> 00:40:31.110
Wouldn't it be nice for us

00:40:31.110 --> 00:40:32.470
to return to Zhengnian Villa

00:40:32.470 --> 00:40:33.870
with the 3 kids

00:40:34.110 --> 00:40:36.040
and live a peaceful life together?

00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:37.630
I know you mean well.

00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:39.090
Don't worry.

00:40:39.510 --> 00:40:40.480
I'll be fine.

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:45.670
Your Highness, you often

00:40:45.670 --> 00:40:46.960
anger His Majesty,

00:40:47.150 --> 00:40:49.840
but now, in a time of hardship, you are
showing how much you care for him.

00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:50.590
Mr. Ma,

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:54.760
I remember that early this year,

00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:55.840
His Majesty took back command

00:40:55.840 --> 00:40:57.030
of the Jinwu Guards.

00:40:57.360 --> 00:40:58.280
Now the Jinwu Guards

00:40:58.280 --> 00:41:00.340
should be under your command, right?

00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:03.030
The person His Majesty trusts most

00:41:03.030 --> 00:41:04.800
is neither the princes and princesses,

00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:06.860
nor any powerful officials at court—

00:41:07.110 --> 00:41:08.400
it's you, Mr. Ma.

00:41:10.070 --> 00:41:11.690
Your Highness, please speak plainly.

00:41:11.690 --> 00:41:13.530
You know what I mean, Mr. Ma.

00:41:14.190 --> 00:41:16.090
Even in ordinary households,

00:41:16.510 --> 00:41:17.440
someone needs to

00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:19.280
keep watch for unexpected visitors,

00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:21.410
let alone in His Majesty's residence.

00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:24.460
Your Highness, rest assured.

00:41:24.670 --> 00:41:25.600
The Jinwu Guards

00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:27.550
have been around His Majesty
the whole time.

00:41:27.550 --> 00:41:28.280
That's good.

00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:31.180
Mr. Ma, please stay.

00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:33.420
His Majesty needs people by his side.

00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:34.700
Your Highness.

00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:40.670
You failed to bring Her Highness back
this time.

00:41:40.670 --> 00:41:42.190
Some at court are already saying

00:41:42.190 --> 00:41:43.030
that you deliberately

00:41:43.030 --> 00:41:44.890
helped Prince of Zhennan escape.

00:41:45.030 --> 00:41:46.460
Nonsense.

00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:47.760
It was clearly me

00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:49.110
who sent the letter
to the Emperor of Jinxiu...

00:41:49.110 --> 00:41:50.670
Of course it's nonsense.

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:52.440
But now that His Majesty is unconscious,

00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:54.230
it is Prime Minister Zhuang
who is controlling the court.

00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:54.830
Moreover,

00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:56.480
the female general of Jinxiu
in your residence

00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:57.360
was indeed

00:41:57.360 --> 00:41:59.110
a subordinate of Prince of Zhennan.

00:41:59.110 --> 00:42:00.110
If anyone tries to take advantage

00:42:00.110 --> 00:42:01.760
of His Majesty's unconsciousness
to move against you,

00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:02.440
then that

00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:03.670
Jinxiu female general in your residence

00:42:03.670 --> 00:42:05.270
will become your weak point.

00:42:05.590 --> 00:42:06.320
Your Highness,

00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:07.550
please be careful.

00:42:09.710 --> 00:42:10.510
Please enjoy.

00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:14.000
Miss Xue.

00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:15.670
You're here early today.

00:42:15.670 --> 00:42:16.510
The ladies instructed me

00:42:16.510 --> 00:42:18.170
to come pick it up early today.

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:23.330
How's business lately?

00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:24.230
Not bad.

00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:28.680
Sister,

00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:29.940
aren't you hungry?

00:42:31.590 --> 00:42:32.400
You eat first.

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:39.200
Two bowls of noodles.

00:42:43.710 --> 00:42:44.840
Something's wrong.

00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:47.290
That day, Wu Ying was waiting for someone.

00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:49.290
It wasn't until she appeared that…

00:42:49.630 --> 00:42:50.360
Take care.

00:42:50.710 --> 00:42:51.230
Bye.

00:42:52.070 --> 00:42:52.710
Sister.

00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:54.690
Are you alright?

00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:56.030
You eat with them first.

00:42:56.030 --> 00:42:57.090
I'll be right back.

00:43:02.110 --> 00:43:02.630
Eat up.

00:43:10.510 --> 00:43:11.480
Miss Xue, you're back?

00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:12.070
Yes.
