00:00:12.125 --> 00:00:13.125
Think hard about

00:00:14.125 --> 00:00:15.916
your performances in the mock exam.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:18.166
Think that's acceptable?

00:00:20.916 --> 00:00:22.291
Did I say you could stop?

00:00:22.375 --> 00:00:23.458
I couldn't help it.

00:00:23.541 --> 00:00:24.458
Get back up there.

00:00:24.541 --> 00:00:26.416
- My shirt fell down.
- I didn't notice.

00:00:27.041 --> 00:00:28.291
An Chi's doing just fine.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.833
Look at her shirt.

00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:43.666
What's going on?

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:44.875
Get back up.

00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:46.583
Sir, is this necessary?

00:00:46.666 --> 00:00:47.958
You need to be punished.

00:00:48.041 --> 00:00:49.208
What's the problem?

00:00:49.291 --> 00:00:51.041
Our shirts keep falling down.

00:00:51.625 --> 00:00:53.083
No one cares. Get back up.

00:00:54.291 --> 00:00:55.708
You pervert.

00:00:55.791 --> 00:00:57.541
What's with your attitude?

00:00:57.625 --> 00:00:58.500
Am I wrong?

00:00:58.583 --> 00:00:59.416
What?

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.000
Want to be class rebel now?

00:01:01.083 --> 00:01:03.958
Hey, back up, all of you.
Want to join her rebellion?

00:01:04.041 --> 00:01:05.791
I can wait as long as it takes.

00:01:05.875 --> 00:01:07.083
Don't you want to leave?

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.208
Go on.

00:01:10.291 --> 00:01:12.625
Having them
do handstands is unacceptable.

00:01:12.708 --> 00:01:15.333
And they made it clear
why it was unacceptable.

00:01:15.416 --> 00:01:17.833
Girls their age
are sensitive about that stuff.

00:01:17.916 --> 00:01:19.916
Let's keep things in perspective.

00:01:20.708 --> 00:01:21.916
The exams are coming up.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.333
Changing teachers now
will have a big impact.

00:01:24.875 --> 00:01:25.833
Right, Mrs. Wang?

00:01:25.916 --> 00:01:27.208
Right.

00:01:27.291 --> 00:01:29.375
It won't help them
changing teachers now.

00:01:29.458 --> 00:01:30.875
Mr. Cheng is well-respected.

00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:33.375
I'm sure he knows what he's doing.

00:01:33.458 --> 00:01:34.958
You're overreacting.

00:01:35.041 --> 00:01:36.583
I'm overreacting?

00:01:36.666 --> 00:01:38.958
Mrs. Huang, you're a lawyer.

00:01:39.041 --> 00:01:41.041
Isn't this obviously sexual harassment?

00:01:41.583 --> 00:01:43.250
It's not like that.

00:01:43.333 --> 00:01:44.750
I asked the students.

00:01:44.833 --> 00:01:46.416
The teacher acted appropriately.

00:01:47.208 --> 00:01:49.416
Mr. Cheng is a good man.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.583
He treats his students

00:01:50.666 --> 00:01:52.666
like they're his own children.

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.833
It's not even an issue
for kids their age.

00:01:54.916 --> 00:01:57.250
Kids? They're 16 years old already.

00:01:57.333 --> 00:01:59.291
Your daughter
can come and strip for us.

00:01:59.375 --> 00:02:00.750
See how she likes it.

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.958
Getting into college
should be the priority right now.

00:02:04.041 --> 00:02:06.958
We mustn't jeopardize
their future over such a petty issue.

00:02:07.041 --> 00:02:08.500
Petty issue?

00:02:08.583 --> 00:02:10.666
I think Mr. Cheng should be fired.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.916
My mom's gonna kill me
when I get home

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.541
for interrupting her at work.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:21.333
Sorry.

00:02:21.833 --> 00:02:23.291
It's not your fault.

00:02:23.375 --> 00:02:24.250
You were helping.

00:02:25.291 --> 00:02:26.791
But that was pretty dumb.

00:02:26.875 --> 00:02:28.875
You called him out
in front of the class.

00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:30.333
He was in the wrong.

00:02:30.416 --> 00:02:34.041
He deserved it, but our parents
got called in and it's your fault.

00:02:34.125 --> 00:02:37.000
An Chi's so dead now.
And the teacher will have your ass.

00:02:37.083 --> 00:02:38.500
It sucks for all of us.

00:02:38.583 --> 00:02:41.250
You should've threatened
to out him on social media

00:02:41.333 --> 00:02:42.791
for being a perv.

00:02:42.875 --> 00:02:44.958
He would've apologized to An Chi then

00:02:45.041 --> 00:02:47.208
and maybe
treated us better to shut us up.

00:02:47.791 --> 00:02:49.708
Then we'd be the ones blackmailing him.

00:02:49.791 --> 00:02:51.166
He's scum.

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.500
- Don't we have to be--
- You're calling me scum?

00:02:53.583 --> 00:02:56.375
- Decisions like that aren't ours to make.
- Right.

00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:57.833
How about this?

00:02:57.916 --> 00:02:59.916
Since opinions are divided,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.916
why don't we vote on it?

00:03:02.416 --> 00:03:04.166
As parents of the three students,

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.041
if you believe
Mr. Cheng's behavior was inappropriate

00:03:07.125 --> 00:03:09.166
and he should be held accountable,

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:10.750
please raise your hand.

00:03:16.625 --> 00:03:18.000
Then that's settled.

00:03:18.083 --> 00:03:19.166
Good.

00:03:19.791 --> 00:03:21.458
Right is right. Wrong is wrong.

00:03:21.541 --> 00:03:23.375
A vote does not change that fact.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.625
The school respects
the decision of the majority.

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.583
- Thank you.
- Thank you all.

00:03:29.666 --> 00:03:30.916
Thank you.

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.041
I agree with Ms. Hsu.

00:03:36.708 --> 00:03:39.500
What Mr. Cheng did
really wasn't appropriate.

00:03:46.041 --> 00:03:46.916
Okay.

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.708
This will be reported
to the Ministry of Education.

00:03:50.791 --> 00:03:53.791
Mr. Cheng will be suspended for now.

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.333
What did I do wrong?
I was protecting you.

00:04:05.416 --> 00:04:07.416
- You messed up.
- Let's drop it, okay?

00:04:09.541 --> 00:04:10.375
Let's go.

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.083
Maybe I was too hot-headed.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.166
You don't say.

00:04:25.208 --> 00:04:26.041
- Mom.
- Let's go.

00:04:26.125 --> 00:04:27.333
- We're going.
- Bye.

00:04:27.416 --> 00:04:28.250
- Bye.
- Thank you.

00:04:28.333 --> 00:04:29.625
What did they say?

00:04:30.791 --> 00:04:32.458
Did I mess up?

00:04:32.541 --> 00:04:33.625
In what way?

00:04:33.708 --> 00:04:35.625
I shouldn't have pushed the teacher.

00:04:35.708 --> 00:04:37.375
He was in the wrong.

00:04:37.458 --> 00:04:38.875
You did the right thing.

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:41.375
You're so brave.

00:06:20.125 --> 00:06:22.833
It was An Chi at the counter.

00:06:22.916 --> 00:06:25.500
And her name was
on the withdrawal slip.

00:06:26.416 --> 00:06:28.166
According to the employee on duty,

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:31.958
she saw the plea for help
on the banknote An Chi gave her.

00:06:32.416 --> 00:06:36.166
- So she called the police.
- Jin Jin. Look, it's Jin Jin.

00:06:41.375 --> 00:06:43.833
Can I get a photo
of the banknote as well?

00:06:45.208 --> 00:06:46.083
The banknote.

00:06:50.416 --> 00:06:52.500
The evidence should all be here.

00:06:53.083 --> 00:06:54.541
But I don't remember whereâ€¦

00:06:55.291 --> 00:06:56.458
It might take a while

00:06:57.041 --> 00:06:58.541
to find it.

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:15.666
A few months ago, the association

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:18.125
held a small fundraiser
to test the waters.

00:07:18.625 --> 00:07:19.458
Here.

00:07:19.875 --> 00:07:21.583
Ever heard of Chang Ching-tsai?

00:07:21.666 --> 00:07:23.208
He donated 15 million dollars.

00:07:23.833 --> 00:07:26.000
But he was going through

00:07:26.083 --> 00:07:27.291
a divorce at the time.

00:07:27.375 --> 00:07:29.458
To divide their assets,

00:07:29.541 --> 00:07:31.125
his ex-wife got the court

00:07:31.208 --> 00:07:32.958
to freeze all his accounts.

00:07:33.333 --> 00:07:36.208
He shouldn't even
have been able to donate a dime.

00:07:36.291 --> 00:07:38.541
So where did the 15 million come from?

00:07:39.375 --> 00:07:41.458
Based on the info you gave me,

00:07:41.541 --> 00:07:45.416
I suspect the Tai Chi Association
did a deal with these donors

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:47.291
to transfer money to themselves

00:07:47.375 --> 00:07:48.583
disguised as donations.

00:07:48.666 --> 00:07:51.708
The goal is to convert
cryptocurrency into cash.

00:07:51.791 --> 00:07:53.291
Mr. Chang, 10 million dollars.

00:07:53.375 --> 00:07:54.375
Taiwan dollars.

00:07:54.458 --> 00:07:56.416
Li Min-hsuan, 450,000 US dollars.

00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:58.000
- 450,000 US.
- 50,000 NTD.

00:07:58.083 --> 00:07:58.958
1.25 million US.

00:07:59.041 --> 00:08:00.833
- 950,000 US.
- 9.5 million NTD.

00:08:00.916 --> 00:08:02.000
That way,

00:08:02.083 --> 00:08:04.458
the dirty cryptocurrency gets laundered

00:08:04.541 --> 00:08:07.666
and appears legitimate
in the banking system.

00:08:08.375 --> 00:08:10.250
You know all that.

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:12.083
But I wonder,

00:08:12.166 --> 00:08:14.500
all these people are well-known figures.

00:08:14.583 --> 00:08:17.750
Why would they risk
helping the association launder money?

00:08:18.625 --> 00:08:19.750
Pure profit.

00:08:20.375 --> 00:08:21.500
It costs them nothing.

00:08:21.583 --> 00:08:24.000
Once donated to the association,

00:08:24.083 --> 00:08:26.083
the funds are exchanged for good karma

00:08:26.166 --> 00:08:27.666
and returned to your accounts.

00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:29.541
Fake donations for real tax breaks.

00:08:29.625 --> 00:08:30.875
For the wealthy,

00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:33.250
even a few percent in tax

00:08:33.333 --> 00:08:34.916
is a lot of money.

00:08:35.375 --> 00:08:36.791
The Tai Chi Association

00:08:36.875 --> 00:08:38.958
probably gives them a small cut as well

00:08:39.041 --> 00:08:42.166
using the same cryptocurrency model.

00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:44.541
No one would ever know
or suspect a thing.

00:08:44.666 --> 00:08:48.000
Who'd have thought
Mrs. Chang was so well-connected?

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:51.083
So many politicians
and businessmen helping her out.

00:08:51.166 --> 00:08:52.500
It's not her.

00:08:54.833 --> 00:08:55.708
He's the key.

00:08:56.333 --> 00:08:57.708
He makes it all happen.

00:09:02.333 --> 00:09:03.541
Kuo Chih-chieh.

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:09.666
He's a legislator.

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:11.666
Why would he risk getting involved?

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:14.000
I'm sure it has its benefits.

00:09:14.083 --> 00:09:15.541
Elections are expensive.

00:09:15.625 --> 00:09:18.041
Now we know
how they're laundering the money,

00:09:18.625 --> 00:09:20.041
can't we bring the cops in?

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.041
If someone as high up
as Kuo Chih-chieh is involved,

00:09:25.666 --> 00:09:27.500
imagine how deep this must go.

00:09:28.041 --> 00:09:31.166
And we've got no idea
which other players are involved.

00:09:31.708 --> 00:09:32.750
I suggest

00:09:32.833 --> 00:09:36.000
we hold off
until we have substantive evidence.

00:09:37.791 --> 00:09:40.791
What exactly
counts as substantive evidence?

00:09:41.375 --> 00:09:42.208
Ledgers.

00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:44.208
Or witnesses,

00:09:44.833 --> 00:09:46.000
ones who'll testify.

00:09:51.708 --> 00:09:53.541
KUO CHIH-CHIEH, CITY COUNCILLOR

00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:03.416
I didn't sleep until 3 a.m.

00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:06.000
My eyelids keep twitching.

00:10:06.625 --> 00:10:08.125
Maybe it's a bad omen.

00:10:09.125 --> 00:10:10.125
You're just tired.

00:10:10.208 --> 00:10:13.458
You need to relax.
I'll book a massage for you tonight.

00:10:14.375 --> 00:10:15.291
Do I have time?

00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:16.791
Sure.

00:10:17.375 --> 00:10:18.500
Okay, whatever.

00:10:23.833 --> 00:10:26.291
HE'S ARRIVED IN BENKHA.
CONTROL YOUR EX-WIFE.

00:10:28.875 --> 00:10:30.875
DON'T CAUSE ANY TROUBLE!

00:11:09.041 --> 00:11:09.875
Look.

00:11:10.708 --> 00:11:13.625
Jin Jin gave the banknote
with the message on it to An Chi.

00:11:14.125 --> 00:11:16.041
So she alerted the police.

00:11:16.125 --> 00:11:18.333
She got them to arrest Chang Shih-kai.

00:11:18.416 --> 00:11:19.916
They weren't working together.

00:11:21.333 --> 00:11:22.416
But An Chiâ€¦

00:11:23.291 --> 00:11:25.791
Why's she insisting
that she alerted the police?

00:11:27.833 --> 00:11:29.166
What's she trying to hide?

00:11:33.541 --> 00:11:34.416
This video

00:11:35.208 --> 00:11:37.375
doesn't even show what she gave An Chi,

00:11:38.041 --> 00:11:39.916
let alone what was written on it.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.291
It's just guesswork. It proves nothing.

00:11:42.791 --> 00:11:44.958
You're convinced it was Jin Jin.

00:11:45.041 --> 00:11:46.875
Nothing I show you will be enough.

00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:47.791
That's not true.

00:11:47.875 --> 00:11:49.458
Then why did you kidnap her?

00:11:49.541 --> 00:11:50.791
I still suspect her.

00:11:57.541 --> 00:12:00.958
Do you know why
no one liked Hsin-yi in school?

00:12:01.833 --> 00:12:03.708
Because she was as stubborn as you.

00:12:03.791 --> 00:12:06.833
She always thought she was right.
To hell with everyone else.

00:12:06.916 --> 00:12:08.458
So no one liked her.

00:12:08.541 --> 00:12:10.208
Did Jin Jin tell you that?

00:12:11.875 --> 00:12:13.250
You know well enough.

00:12:13.708 --> 00:12:15.500
You caused Hsin-yi's death.

00:12:16.541 --> 00:12:18.541
Acting the way you taught her,

00:12:18.625 --> 00:12:19.916
and being so stubborn

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.125
and impulsive
in such a dangerous situation,

00:12:22.208 --> 00:12:24.666
I'm not surprised she ended up dead.

00:12:25.708 --> 00:12:27.291
Who betrayed them?

00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:29.750
I will find out.

00:12:29.833 --> 00:12:32.458
Don't be surprised
if it turns out it was Jin Jin!

00:12:32.541 --> 00:12:34.916
Kill her if you think she did it!

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.083
Do you think I won't?

00:12:49.541 --> 00:12:51.000
I know you won't.

00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:52.875
Will you?

00:12:56.250 --> 00:12:58.083
Let's get the crypto wallet first.

00:13:11.666 --> 00:13:12.958
What are you doing?

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:17.083
How will you prove
Jin Jin's innocence if I'm dead?

00:13:17.833 --> 00:13:19.375
Jin Jin wasn't my girlfriend.

00:13:19.458 --> 00:13:20.833
An Chi was.

00:13:20.916 --> 00:13:22.958
She recruited Jin Jin.

00:13:24.666 --> 00:13:26.583
It was An Chi who pushed Jin Jin.

00:13:35.916 --> 00:13:37.083
Say that again.

00:13:38.375 --> 00:13:40.000
Repeat what you just said!

00:13:41.333 --> 00:13:44.083
An Chi tricked Jin Jin
into coming here.

00:13:44.166 --> 00:13:46.083
An Chi was my real girlfriend.

00:13:46.583 --> 00:13:48.375
It was An Chi who pushed Jin Jin.

00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:53.500
You idiot!
Think anyone will believe that?

00:13:53.583 --> 00:13:55.541
- You idiot!
- You enjoy messing with me?

00:13:55.625 --> 00:13:56.666
Kill me!

00:13:56.750 --> 00:13:59.458
Just kill me.
Chao Ching won't let her go either way.

00:14:02.291 --> 00:14:03.416
Or how about this?

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:04.541
Release me

00:14:05.166 --> 00:14:06.416
and I'll kill Chao Ching.

00:14:55.708 --> 00:14:57.083
Chang I-ting contacted me.

00:14:57.750 --> 00:14:59.500
She's waiting at the hotel.

00:15:00.083 --> 00:15:01.125
What's our next move?

00:15:05.666 --> 00:15:07.291
Proceed with the original plan.

00:15:23.458 --> 00:15:24.375
You're back.

00:15:24.458 --> 00:15:25.291
Yeah.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.500
Where did you go last night?

00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:39.708
Why didn't you tell me?

00:15:40.375 --> 00:15:41.291
I was worried.

00:15:43.166 --> 00:15:44.791
My mom's having me followed

00:15:44.875 --> 00:15:46.333
so I hid at a friend's place.

00:15:51.583 --> 00:15:52.916
Were you hurt?

00:15:53.833 --> 00:15:54.666
I'm fine.

00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:56.958
By the way, I got the wallet.

00:15:57.041 --> 00:15:58.583
But I don't know the password.

00:15:58.666 --> 00:16:00.125
Can we still get the money?

00:16:03.958 --> 00:16:05.000
Of course not.

00:16:06.875 --> 00:16:08.750
I thought you were an expert?

00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:11.375
You must know how to crack it.

00:16:14.375 --> 00:16:15.916
It's not that simple.

00:16:16.708 --> 00:16:18.166
It can't be cracked.

00:16:20.125 --> 00:16:21.000
I see.

00:16:24.375 --> 00:16:25.250
I see.

00:16:27.083 --> 00:16:28.000
I see.

00:16:31.833 --> 00:16:33.583
Then why bother keeping you?

00:16:33.666 --> 00:16:35.000
When did you find out?

00:16:35.083 --> 00:16:37.750
Ages ago. You think I really liked you?

00:16:38.291 --> 00:16:41.000
I only liked you
for your money, your status,

00:16:41.083 --> 00:16:42.416
and your fake persona.

00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:45.375
But you're just a cheap gigolo!

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.250
You think
that pretending to be rich can hide

00:16:48.333 --> 00:16:49.916
what a cheap loser you are?

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.833
Who do you think you're fooling?

00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:53.583
You.

00:16:57.083 --> 00:16:58.750
Just quit projecting.

00:16:58.833 --> 00:17:00.708
Remember that German phrase I said?

00:17:01.458 --> 00:17:02.458
Du bist dumm.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.375
It's not "you're beautiful."

00:17:05.125 --> 00:17:06.500
It means you're stupid.

00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:27.375
Since you know who I really am,

00:17:28.083 --> 00:17:29.583
you must also know

00:17:29.666 --> 00:17:31.083
that we have your brother.

00:17:31.958 --> 00:17:34.625
Will you exchange this money
for your brother's life?

00:17:43.958 --> 00:17:45.666
You only bring me trouble!

00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:48.041
Didn't I teach you how to torture someone

00:17:48.125 --> 00:17:49.333
to get what you want?

00:17:49.416 --> 00:17:52.500
Why couldn't you get the passcode
to the safe out of him? Why?

00:17:53.166 --> 00:17:54.000
Stop hitting him!

00:17:54.083 --> 00:17:55.750
Wanna protect him?

00:17:55.833 --> 00:17:57.125
I'll hit you too.

00:17:57.208 --> 00:17:59.000
I'll send you back to the orphanage.

00:17:59.083 --> 00:18:00.291
You dare touch her!

00:18:01.958 --> 00:18:03.791
Think it costs nothing to raise her?

00:18:03.875 --> 00:18:05.375
I'll make twice as much!

00:18:07.083 --> 00:18:08.083
I'll do anything

00:18:09.166 --> 00:18:10.291
you want me to.

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:13.000
But I have one condition.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:14.875
Let I-ting

00:18:15.833 --> 00:18:17.500
live a clean life.

00:18:18.625 --> 00:18:19.875
Live a normal life.

00:18:25.791 --> 00:18:26.666
Fine.

00:18:30.041 --> 00:18:30.916
Fine.

00:18:36.208 --> 00:18:37.750
I-ting has a good brother.

00:18:44.333 --> 00:18:48.083
- What lame-ass lawyer did you hire?
- The problem is a lack of witnesses.

00:18:48.166 --> 00:18:49.583
Can't you get some fake ones?

00:18:49.666 --> 00:18:51.750
That's not easy
with you being caught here.

00:18:51.833 --> 00:18:53.125
I told you. I was set--

00:18:53.208 --> 00:18:54.666
Be quiet!

00:18:56.416 --> 00:18:57.666
I was set up.

00:18:58.166 --> 00:18:59.041
Stop crying.

00:19:01.125 --> 00:19:03.666
I've always said family comes first.

00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:06.291
We must all
make sacrifices for the family.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.416
- So you want to sacrifice me?
- Think I want this?

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:13.541
It'd be like losing a limb.
Like losing a part of myself.

00:19:14.583 --> 00:19:16.791
You just want me silenced, right?

00:19:16.875 --> 00:19:18.208
Think of the family.

00:19:18.291 --> 00:19:19.250
Think of I-ting.

00:19:19.833 --> 00:19:21.416
Decide for yourself.

00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:25.583
If I were in your place,
I'd sacrifice myself.

00:19:32.458 --> 00:19:33.375
Okay.

00:19:34.416 --> 00:19:35.416
But promise me this.

00:19:36.333 --> 00:19:38.500
Half of everything I made for you

00:19:38.583 --> 00:19:39.666
must be left to her.

00:19:40.875 --> 00:19:41.708
I can do that.

00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:44.583
Okay.

00:20:04.375 --> 00:20:06.708
Why wasn't I told
when Jin Jin was transferred?

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:09.291
- I thought she--
- That she was dead?

00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:11.208
I didn't say that.

00:20:12.041 --> 00:20:13.458
Don't tell Hui-chun that.

00:20:13.541 --> 00:20:15.541
I heard your mistress is in Benkha.

00:20:17.458 --> 00:20:18.916
What do you want from me?

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.916
I've done everything Hui-chun wanted.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.583
I signed the divorce papers.

00:20:22.666 --> 00:20:24.666
But I am not Hui-chun.

00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:26.000
I need your help.

00:20:26.083 --> 00:20:27.500
- What can I do?
- Not you.

00:20:28.541 --> 00:20:29.791
Chou Shu-ting.

00:20:31.083 --> 00:20:34.791
I want records of transactions between
Mr. Kuo and the Tai Chi Association.

00:20:34.875 --> 00:20:36.750
Not a chance. That would ruin her.

00:20:37.333 --> 00:20:38.916
I can't help you with this.

00:20:39.875 --> 00:20:42.041
I've seen your divorce agreement.

00:20:43.208 --> 00:20:45.791
Most of the terms
are related to Jin Jin.

00:20:46.416 --> 00:20:49.000
Your current residence goes to Jin Jin,

00:20:49.083 --> 00:20:51.958
as does a generous annual alimony.

00:20:52.041 --> 00:20:53.208
You have to pay this

00:20:53.291 --> 00:20:56.833
no matter what happens
between you and Chou Shu-ting.

00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:04.041
But if Jin Jin dies,

00:21:05.791 --> 00:21:08.250
all those terms will be void.

00:21:08.875 --> 00:21:09.750
What do you mean?

00:21:10.333 --> 00:21:12.041
Jin Jin is currently in my care.

00:21:12.125 --> 00:21:15.000
Persuade Chou Shu-ting
to get me what I want,

00:21:16.833 --> 00:21:17.708
and anything

00:21:18.916 --> 00:21:20.250
you might want done to her

00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:23.333
I can do for you.

00:21:32.083 --> 00:21:33.041
What do you mean?

00:21:33.125 --> 00:21:34.458
A problem with the money?

00:21:34.541 --> 00:21:36.958
No, just a technical problem.

00:21:37.041 --> 00:21:38.916
It's not that serious.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.083
We're working on it.

00:21:40.166 --> 00:21:42.833
But it might not be ready
for the event tomorrow--

00:21:42.916 --> 00:21:45.291
Stop beating around the bush.
Get to the point.

00:21:46.125 --> 00:21:49.375
Could we postpone the event
for a day or two?

00:21:49.458 --> 00:21:50.750
Just for a few days.

00:21:50.833 --> 00:21:51.958
Are you kidding?

00:21:52.041 --> 00:21:55.250
I have to be back
for the primary the day after tomorrow.

00:21:55.833 --> 00:21:57.958
Think it was easy getting them on board?

00:21:58.041 --> 00:22:01.583
How will you launder money without them?
Run for election without money?

00:22:02.291 --> 00:22:03.500
What are you saying?

00:22:04.958 --> 00:22:05.958
Nothing.

00:22:07.166 --> 00:22:08.666
We just wanted to discuss

00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:10.625
the possibility of changing the date

00:22:10.708 --> 00:22:11.833
and the theme.

00:22:11.916 --> 00:22:12.875
No chance.

00:22:12.958 --> 00:22:15.291
Proceed as planned tomorrow
or don't bother.

00:22:15.375 --> 00:22:17.958
This is a critical moment.
Every day counts.

00:22:19.833 --> 00:22:20.708
Understood.

00:22:21.708 --> 00:22:22.625
Understood.

00:22:27.125 --> 00:22:28.083
I'll see you out.

00:23:08.875 --> 00:23:09.708
Shih-kai!

00:23:10.916 --> 00:23:11.833
Where is it?

00:23:29.791 --> 00:23:30.916
There's a dashcam.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.583
Doubt you want this going viral.

00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:43.125
I-ting, listen up.
There's a dashcam in the car.

00:23:46.958 --> 00:23:48.125
Don't push me.

00:23:48.208 --> 00:23:49.291
Release my brother.

00:23:51.958 --> 00:23:53.041
Now!

00:24:21.833 --> 00:24:22.708
Let's go.

00:24:29.583 --> 00:24:31.583
Why didn't you kill them just now?

00:24:47.250 --> 00:24:48.125
I'll drive.

00:25:21.833 --> 00:25:23.500
First time firing a gun?

00:25:23.583 --> 00:25:25.541
Fuck, you should've just killed them.

00:25:29.625 --> 00:25:31.625
Once the old hag
gives us the password,

00:25:31.708 --> 00:25:33.083
we can enjoy our lives.

00:25:33.875 --> 00:25:35.291
I'll take you to Myanmar.

00:25:35.375 --> 00:25:37.416
I know a ton of people there.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.333
I'll get them all together

00:25:39.416 --> 00:25:41.458
and make a comeback.

00:25:50.583 --> 00:25:51.833
What's the matter?

00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:54.500
Shih-kai.

00:25:57.750 --> 00:25:59.583
You've always been good to me.

00:26:01.416 --> 00:26:04.791
You worked hard to make money
and put me through school.

00:26:06.416 --> 00:26:07.708
I've always been grateful.

00:26:11.458 --> 00:26:13.916
But we live
in completely different worlds.

00:26:15.666 --> 00:26:16.875
You made your choice.

00:26:17.625 --> 00:26:19.041
And I had the life I wanted.

00:26:21.916 --> 00:26:23.666
But my life wasn't what it seemed.

00:26:24.166 --> 00:26:26.125
Do you know how much I had to suffer?

00:26:27.416 --> 00:26:28.583
In other people's eyes,

00:26:29.250 --> 00:26:33.291
I was still just the sister
of a con artist and a murderer.

00:26:36.041 --> 00:26:37.291
What are you saying?

00:26:38.666 --> 00:26:40.166
Didn't you tell her back then

00:26:41.250 --> 00:26:43.166
to let me live a clean life?

00:26:45.916 --> 00:26:47.250
I think I get it now.

00:26:48.541 --> 00:26:50.166
Only once you're dead

00:26:50.875 --> 00:26:52.750
can I truly be clean.

00:26:56.625 --> 00:26:57.541
What're you doing?

00:26:57.625 --> 00:26:59.125
I want half of the money.

00:26:59.208 --> 00:27:00.833
- Put the gun down.
- The money.

00:27:02.541 --> 00:27:05.000
- Put it down!
- Give me the money!

00:27:06.666 --> 00:27:08.291
- Give me the money!
- Cut it out!

00:27:08.375 --> 00:27:09.833
Give me the money!

00:28:23.916 --> 00:28:26.250
I-ting. I-ting.

00:29:03.708 --> 00:29:05.000
Remember your promise.

00:29:05.625 --> 00:29:06.875
Kill Chao Ching

00:29:08.083 --> 00:29:09.833
and I'll give you back the wallet.

00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:40.541
Has she been found?

00:29:41.291 --> 00:29:42.166
Not yet.

00:29:50.458 --> 00:29:52.625
Two police officers
are here to see you.

00:30:10.333 --> 00:30:13.750
Chang I-ting was in the passenger seat.

00:30:13.833 --> 00:30:17.500
We need to verify whether her mother knows
who she might have been with.

00:30:21.458 --> 00:30:22.541
Here, Sergeant.

00:30:23.666 --> 00:30:26.375
See if these belonged to your daughter.

00:30:27.541 --> 00:30:29.708
We know how
you must be feeling right now.

00:30:29.791 --> 00:30:32.666
But there's one more thing
we need to confirm with you.

00:30:32.750 --> 00:30:35.500
Chang I-ting was found
in the passenger seat.

00:30:35.583 --> 00:30:37.625
Someone else was driving.

00:30:38.583 --> 00:30:41.708
Do you know who she might have been with?

00:30:47.416 --> 00:30:48.416
I don't know.

00:30:51.708 --> 00:30:52.833
Breaking news.

00:30:52.916 --> 00:30:55.291
A car accident in the suburbs of Benkha

00:30:55.375 --> 00:30:57.333
resulted in one fatality.

00:30:57.416 --> 00:30:59.208
The victim has been identified

00:30:59.291 --> 00:31:02.333
as 26-year-old woman Chang I-ting.

00:31:02.416 --> 00:31:05.291
Police are still
investigating the accident.

00:31:05.375 --> 00:31:09.125
We will keep you updated
as more information becomes available.

00:31:09.208 --> 00:31:12.125
And now,
let's move on to the next headline.

00:31:21.250 --> 00:31:25.166
CHANG I-TING

00:31:28.416 --> 00:31:30.250
Can we really just leave like this?

00:31:30.750 --> 00:31:31.708
Someone's dead.

00:31:31.791 --> 00:31:34.083
If things escalate
and we get caught up in it,

00:31:34.166 --> 00:31:35.583
they won't let us leave.

00:31:36.458 --> 00:31:38.416
But Chang Shih-kai is still alive.

00:31:39.083 --> 00:31:40.458
If he talks about what I--

00:31:40.541 --> 00:31:41.500
About what?

00:31:41.583 --> 00:31:42.583
What have you done?

00:31:43.166 --> 00:31:44.875
Who would believe a murderer?

00:31:47.583 --> 00:31:48.916
From now on,

00:31:49.458 --> 00:31:51.500
just forget everything that happened.

00:31:51.583 --> 00:31:52.625
Forget about him.

00:31:52.708 --> 00:31:54.458
Forget Hsin-yi. Forget Jin Jin.

00:31:55.291 --> 00:31:56.625
This was a tragedy.

00:31:57.958 --> 00:31:59.458
You're the sole survivor.

00:32:00.041 --> 00:32:02.166
If you truly cared about them,

00:32:03.416 --> 00:32:05.000
then you should concentrate on

00:32:05.083 --> 00:32:07.458
making the best of your life
for their sakes.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.083
I've planned everything out for you.

00:32:10.166 --> 00:32:11.125
Do you understand?

00:32:18.958 --> 00:32:19.791
An Ning.

00:32:19.875 --> 00:32:22.291
Mom, when are you coming home?

00:32:22.791 --> 00:32:24.958
We're on the plane back right now.

00:32:25.041 --> 00:32:25.875
Okay.

00:32:26.416 --> 00:32:27.833
See, your sister's here.

00:32:28.458 --> 00:32:30.208
Hi, An Ning. Did you miss me?

00:32:30.291 --> 00:32:31.625
Yes, I missed you.

00:32:31.708 --> 00:32:34.666
Did you memorize
the 20 words I gave you yesterday?

00:32:35.541 --> 00:32:36.708
No.

00:32:39.625 --> 00:32:40.458
An Ning,

00:32:40.541 --> 00:32:42.500
I've told you.

00:32:42.583 --> 00:32:44.000
You can't just play all day.

00:32:44.083 --> 00:32:47.125
You think your sis is amazing
and want to be like her, right?

00:32:47.208 --> 00:32:48.750
- So study hard.
- Be right back.

00:32:48.833 --> 00:32:49.666
Okay.

00:32:50.125 --> 00:32:53.083
I've planned out everything for you.
It's for your own good.

00:32:53.166 --> 00:32:54.958
- Do what I say, okay?
- I know.

00:32:55.041 --> 00:32:57.041
Excuse me, miss. The aircraft is--

00:32:57.125 --> 00:32:59.166
- That's all for now. Bye.
- Bye-bye!

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:00.833
Okay.

00:33:00.916 --> 00:33:02.416
- Please put your phone--
- Okay.

00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:05.000
We're about to close
the cabin doors for departure.

00:33:05.083 --> 00:33:09.291
Please take your seat. Ground staff,
please leave the aircraft. Thank you.

00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:15.750
Ladies and gentlemen,
the cabin doors are about to be closed.

00:33:15.833 --> 00:33:17.916
Miss, please return back to your seat.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:19.291
The plane is taking off.

00:33:21.291 --> 00:33:24.666
Miss, the plane is taking off immediately.

00:33:24.750 --> 00:33:27.458
Please return to your seat
for your own safety, miss.

00:33:29.791 --> 00:33:34.291
The victim has been identified as
26-year-old woman Chang I-ting.

00:33:34.416 --> 00:33:37.583
Police are investigating the accident
and report evidence

00:33:37.666 --> 00:33:41.375
suggesting a male was driving the vehicle
at the time of the crash.

00:33:41.458 --> 00:33:44.708
The driver's whereabouts post-accident
remain unknown.

00:33:44.791 --> 00:33:46.625
Authorities are continuing their--

00:33:48.750 --> 00:33:50.041
He's a male prostitute.

00:33:51.416 --> 00:33:53.541
He's posing as a trust fund baby.

00:33:53.625 --> 00:33:55.750
We used the same lame trick
in our scams.

00:33:55.833 --> 00:33:57.291
How could I-ting fall for it?

00:33:57.875 --> 00:33:59.125
She's an idiot.

00:34:02.125 --> 00:34:03.833
Whatever happens, find him

00:34:04.458 --> 00:34:05.750
and get the crypto wallet.

00:34:06.625 --> 00:34:07.541
Understood?

00:34:07.625 --> 00:34:08.916
Any means necessary.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:09.833
Yes.

00:34:32.416 --> 00:34:34.083
You really want Chao Ching dead?

00:34:36.916 --> 00:34:38.208
She wants Jin Jin dead.

00:34:40.333 --> 00:34:42.125
Is she really that kind of person?

00:34:42.833 --> 00:34:45.041
She wouldn't kill an innocent person.

00:34:47.333 --> 00:34:49.041
What if Jin Jin isn't innocent?

00:34:51.666 --> 00:34:53.416
Chang Shih-kai told me

00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:57.541
he'd transfer money to her account
every time she recruited someone.

00:34:59.291 --> 00:35:00.791
Have you checked this account?

00:35:02.125 --> 00:35:03.541
I have.

00:35:03.625 --> 00:35:06.250
She does have another account at TMBC.

00:35:06.833 --> 00:35:09.416
But I've tried her birthdate,
lucky number,

00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:12.166
and even her license plate,
but none of them worked.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:14.166
Let me see.

00:35:17.875 --> 00:35:19.125
How about your birthday?

00:35:22.375 --> 00:35:26.000
Lots of people use their loved ones'
birthdays as passwords.

00:35:31.833 --> 00:35:34.791
LOGIN SUCCESSFUL

00:35:38.916 --> 00:35:41.291
ACCOUNT BALANCE

00:35:45.750 --> 00:35:47.125
She got paid for everyone

00:35:47.208 --> 00:35:48.208
she helped recruit.

00:35:49.125 --> 00:35:50.166
Hello, I'm Jin Jin.

00:35:50.250 --> 00:35:53.208
It's June 1st, 2 p.m.

00:35:53.291 --> 00:35:55.708
This is my good friend, An Chi.

00:35:55.791 --> 00:35:57.208
Hello!

00:35:57.291 --> 00:36:00.125
Jin Jin already knew Chang Shih-kai.
She started all this.

00:36:00.208 --> 00:36:02.250
Jin Jin was Chang Shih-kai's girlfriend.

00:36:02.333 --> 00:36:04.500
She tricked Hsin-yi
and An Chi into coming.

00:36:15.166 --> 00:36:16.208
Hello?

00:36:16.291 --> 00:36:17.333
Where is he?

00:36:19.333 --> 00:36:20.416
He's here.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:22.333
You're lying.

00:36:22.416 --> 00:36:23.541
I'll video call you.

00:36:24.416 --> 00:36:25.875
Wait, heâ€¦

00:36:26.958 --> 00:36:28.083
He got away.

00:36:28.166 --> 00:36:29.125
They had a gun.

00:36:29.208 --> 00:36:30.708
There was nothing I could do.

00:36:30.791 --> 00:36:31.875
You let him go.

00:36:32.958 --> 00:36:35.250
Think you can ruin my plan?

00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:36.916
Don't you believe

00:36:37.791 --> 00:36:39.375
I'll kill Jin Jin right now?

00:36:56.666 --> 00:36:57.958
Where is Chang Shih-kai?

00:36:59.750 --> 00:37:01.041
Hui-chun let him go.

00:37:09.875 --> 00:37:11.958
You wanted to get revenge,

00:37:12.041 --> 00:37:15.916
but now
the Tai Chi Association is after you.

00:37:16.708 --> 00:37:19.750
You've put yourselfâ€¦

00:37:21.416 --> 00:37:23.041
â€¦in grave danger.

00:37:23.625 --> 00:37:27.333
Hsin-yi would be so sad if she knew.

00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:34.666
Can't you let her back?

00:37:41.250 --> 00:37:42.583
We'll leave here.

00:37:43.875 --> 00:37:44.708
Together.

00:38:21.166 --> 00:38:23.291
She wouldn't just kill an innocent person.

00:38:23.375 --> 00:38:25.083
It wasn't easy getting this far

00:38:25.166 --> 00:38:26.791
and you've been through so much.

00:38:27.375 --> 00:38:29.458
They're looking for me everywhere now.

00:38:29.541 --> 00:38:32.916
They know who I am and how I tricked
Chang I-ting into running away,

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:35.166
but not
that Chang Shih-kai is still alive.

00:38:35.250 --> 00:38:37.250
So if you
and Chao Ching work together,

00:38:37.333 --> 00:38:38.958
your plan should still work.

00:38:39.041 --> 00:38:39.958
Eason.

00:38:42.708 --> 00:38:43.625
You should leave.

00:38:44.750 --> 00:38:46.166
Chang I-ting is dead.

00:38:46.875 --> 00:38:48.416
Your cut of the ransom money

00:38:49.041 --> 00:38:50.125
should be enough

00:38:51.208 --> 00:38:53.166
to take care of you and your grandma.

00:38:53.250 --> 00:38:55.416
You think I agreed to help you

00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:56.583
for the money?

00:39:07.625 --> 00:39:09.791
I don't know
if this will make any sense,

00:39:10.541 --> 00:39:12.250
but as I got older,

00:39:13.541 --> 00:39:15.750
I learned
that being good doesn't pay off.

00:39:16.250 --> 00:39:18.333
No matter how hard I tried,

00:39:18.416 --> 00:39:20.125
the world always seemed unfair.

00:39:20.916 --> 00:39:22.666
Good people never defeated the bad.

00:39:23.416 --> 00:39:25.000
That was until I met you guys.

00:39:25.083 --> 00:39:27.500
You made me see
that maybe good people can win.

00:39:28.083 --> 00:39:31.416
So can't I at least stick around
until all this is over?

00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:33.791
- I--
- But you're of no more use to me.

00:39:33.875 --> 00:39:35.208
I don't care. You can--

00:39:35.291 --> 00:39:37.291
Stop following me around like a puppy.

00:39:37.375 --> 00:39:38.500
Just leave.

00:39:39.625 --> 00:39:40.500
Hui-chun.

00:39:41.666 --> 00:39:42.625
Hui-chun!

00:39:56.833 --> 00:39:58.083
Sign here.

00:40:00.291 --> 00:40:01.208
And here.

00:40:19.208 --> 00:40:20.666
That puts an end to it all.

00:40:22.208 --> 00:40:24.041
I'm doing this for Hui-chun.

00:40:25.083 --> 00:40:27.541
She can stop suffering
and live a better life.

00:40:42.791 --> 00:40:44.750
Do you want to see her one last time?

00:41:19.666 --> 00:41:20.500
Hello?

00:41:20.583 --> 00:41:23.541
Ms. Chao,
there's something I want to tell you.

00:41:23.625 --> 00:41:24.625
Can we meet?

00:41:24.708 --> 00:41:25.958
I'll send the location.

00:41:29.041 --> 00:41:30.041
CHAO CHING

00:41:30.125 --> 00:41:31.833
LOCATION INFORMATION

00:41:49.791 --> 00:41:52.333
TAI CHI ASSOCIATION
HOLDS GRAND CEREMONY TONIGHT

00:41:52.416 --> 00:41:54.916
POLITICAL AND BUSINESS LEADERS
OFFER THEIR SUPPORT

00:42:21.125 --> 00:42:23.000
I'll cut the bandage for you.

00:42:27.291 --> 00:42:28.125
What?

00:42:28.625 --> 00:42:30.000
Think I'm gonna kill you?

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:32.000
As if I'd dare.

00:42:37.916 --> 00:42:39.083
Like you wouldn't.

00:42:39.666 --> 00:42:41.041
You're tougher than them.

00:42:41.625 --> 00:42:42.833
Think I didn't see?

00:42:43.416 --> 00:42:44.416
You pushed Jin Jin.

00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:45.625
She deserved it.

00:42:46.583 --> 00:42:48.500
She tricked Hsin-yi into coming.

00:42:48.583 --> 00:42:50.041
Now Hsin-yi's dead.

00:43:04.583 --> 00:43:06.208
Know why Hsin-yi came?

00:43:06.791 --> 00:43:08.416
- Do you?
- You told me before.

00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:09.833
Because Jin Jin hated her.

00:43:10.666 --> 00:43:11.583
You believe that?

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:20.750
I had my eye on you
the first night you arrived.

00:43:21.541 --> 00:43:23.583
We had a lot of fun that night, right?

00:43:23.666 --> 00:43:24.833
Do you remember?

00:43:25.666 --> 00:43:27.166
Later, you fell asleep.

00:43:27.250 --> 00:43:28.583
You wouldn't have known,

00:43:29.666 --> 00:43:32.583
but there was
a long queue of guys outside the door.

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:34.458
They all wanted to bang you.

00:43:35.125 --> 00:43:36.791
But I didn't let them.

00:43:38.041 --> 00:43:39.833
I was the only one who touched you.

00:43:40.583 --> 00:43:41.791
That child is mine.

00:43:42.791 --> 00:43:44.000
I promised Jin Jin

00:43:44.541 --> 00:43:46.666
that if she brought another girl,

00:43:47.208 --> 00:43:49.291
I wouldn't let anyone else touch you.

00:43:50.916 --> 00:43:53.125
And look what you did to her.

00:44:13.958 --> 00:44:14.791
Officer Li.

00:44:15.416 --> 00:44:16.291
Where's Jin Jin?

00:44:17.958 --> 00:44:19.958
Sorry, we were too late.

00:44:20.666 --> 00:44:22.125
What do you mean too late?

00:44:23.041 --> 00:44:24.833
Didn't you say she was here?

00:44:25.458 --> 00:44:27.583
The nurse said that Jin Jin was discharged

00:44:27.666 --> 00:44:29.375
just before I got here.

00:44:29.458 --> 00:44:30.458
Someone took her.

00:44:31.041 --> 00:44:31.916
Also,

00:44:32.583 --> 00:44:35.958
a family member signed this consent form
to turn off life support.

00:44:36.416 --> 00:44:37.791
SUN KUO-CHIANG

00:44:50.333 --> 00:44:51.875
What're you doing? What's up?

00:44:51.958 --> 00:44:53.166
Bastard, I'll kill you!

00:44:53.250 --> 00:44:54.083
What is it?

00:44:54.166 --> 00:44:55.583
- How could you?
- What is it?

00:44:55.666 --> 00:44:56.708
How could you?

00:44:56.791 --> 00:44:58.000
What are you doing?

00:44:58.583 --> 00:45:00.750
What're you doing? Are you insane?

00:45:05.916 --> 00:45:07.083
You'll burn in hell.

00:45:10.375 --> 00:45:12.041
That's a problem for another day.

00:45:19.708 --> 00:45:20.541
Sorry.

00:45:58.375 --> 00:45:59.875
You screwed up.

00:46:00.750 --> 00:46:01.833
What good is this?

00:46:04.083 --> 00:46:05.666
Things changed, all right?

00:46:07.416 --> 00:46:09.291
The original plan likely won't work.

00:46:09.375 --> 00:46:13.083
Why'd you take matters
into your own hands and tell her?

00:46:14.250 --> 00:46:15.500
Figure it out yourself.

00:46:23.791 --> 00:46:25.416
Who do you think you are?

00:46:27.583 --> 00:46:28.416
Asshole.

00:46:30.833 --> 00:46:33.500
I just want you to pass on a message.

00:46:35.916 --> 00:46:37.458
Don't forget your place.

00:46:41.333 --> 00:46:42.500
Keep hold.

00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:57.041
Pong, what was that?

00:46:57.125 --> 00:46:58.333
Bothering you again?

00:46:58.416 --> 00:46:59.291
It was nothing.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:01.041
Repaying some debts.

00:47:02.375 --> 00:47:03.833
Sure it's just money you owe?

00:47:04.625 --> 00:47:05.875
Did you want something?

00:47:14.041 --> 00:47:15.208
Is Jin Jin still alive?

00:47:20.500 --> 00:47:22.333
- Who wants to know?
- Just answer.

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:31.000
When I left the hospital this morning,

00:47:32.208 --> 00:47:33.291
she was still alive.

00:47:36.250 --> 00:47:40.041
Do you think Chao Ching
is that kind of person?

00:47:40.875 --> 00:47:44.583
Pong, don't you think
this is all getting a bit out of hand?

00:47:45.416 --> 00:47:46.833
We just wanted revenge.

00:47:46.916 --> 00:47:48.708
Why all this infighting?

00:47:50.041 --> 00:47:51.083
I never expected it.

00:47:53.500 --> 00:47:56.208
Hui-chun let Chang Shih-kai go.

00:47:56.875 --> 00:47:58.791
She told him to kill Chao Ching.

00:47:59.416 --> 00:48:00.458
Forget revenge now,

00:48:00.833 --> 00:48:02.750
they'll be lucky just to survive.

00:48:04.208 --> 00:48:06.083
Why would she do that to Chao Ching?

00:48:06.166 --> 00:48:09.083
They don't trust each other.
Nothing we say will help.

00:48:10.125 --> 00:48:12.166
I know you care about Chao Ching.

00:48:12.625 --> 00:48:14.125
And I care about Hui-chun.

00:48:14.500 --> 00:48:16.250
We have to do something

00:48:16.333 --> 00:48:17.750
to get them to stop.

00:48:19.458 --> 00:48:20.291
How?

00:48:20.875 --> 00:48:23.458
Tell me which hospital Jin Jin is in.

00:48:24.291 --> 00:48:25.875
And I'll give you the wallet.

00:48:27.041 --> 00:48:30.125
Then Hui-chun
can take Jin Jin back to Taiwan.

00:48:30.708 --> 00:48:34.458
And Chao Ching can stop
the association from getting that money.

00:48:35.208 --> 00:48:38.208
Everyone can go their separate ways.

00:48:42.791 --> 00:48:43.625
Okay.

00:49:55.791 --> 00:49:56.708
Record this.

00:49:59.166 --> 00:50:01.708
Your good friend, Wang Hui-chun,

00:50:02.375 --> 00:50:05.708
wants me to take your life
in exchange for the crypto wallet.

00:50:07.500 --> 00:50:08.458
Sorry.

00:50:37.458 --> 00:50:38.291
Who's there?

00:50:41.750 --> 00:50:42.666
Sorry.

00:51:06.125 --> 00:51:07.583
Split up and chase him!

00:51:24.208 --> 00:51:25.500
After him!

00:53:49.750 --> 00:53:50.583
Eason.
