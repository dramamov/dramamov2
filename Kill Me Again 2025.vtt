01:42.703 --> 01:45.938
Hey, you think they know ahead
of time what they're supposed

01:45.939 --> 01:49.143
to say, or do the news people
just make it up?

01:51.379 --> 01:53.046
It's not a fucking
cartoon, Gary.

01:54.948 --> 01:56.250
Hey, just turn that up.

01:56.584 --> 01:59.453
This isn't your
living room, you know.

01:59.887 --> 02:01.921
Oh, if it was, you'd have
a beer in your hand,

02:01.922 --> 02:03.291
and you'd be about ready to
give me a foot rub.

02:03.491 --> 02:04.091
Oh, yeah.

02:04.292 --> 02:05.293
What about Gary?

02:06.160 --> 02:07.428
Gary, don't like foot rubs.

02:07.628 --> 02:09.329
Hey, I'd like a foot rub.

02:09.330 --> 02:10.398
Shut the fuck up, Gary.

02:12.333 --> 02:13.400
That's right.

02:13.401 --> 02:15.067
It's a gruesome scene here
in the Heights.

02:15.068 --> 02:16.903
As far as we know, two were
dead,

02:16.904 --> 02:18.371
and one is
critically injured.

02:18.372 --> 02:21.508
The injured individual is
being rushed to St.
Mary's Hospital

02:21.509 --> 02:23.510
and is currently fighting
for their life.

02:23.511 --> 02:26.646
Eyewitness accounts report
an older model pickup truck

02:26.647 --> 02:28.115
leaving the scene.

02:28.316 --> 02:30.283
It is still preliminary,
but with the midnight

02:30.284 --> 02:31.351
mangler on the loose--

02:31.352 --> 02:32.186
Hey!

02:32.820 --> 02:33.587
Not tonight, huh?

02:35.022 --> 02:36.089
Oh, sorry.

02:36.290 --> 02:37.425
You can just sit anywhere.

02:40.361 --> 02:42.430
Jesus Christ, "Mangler".

02:42.663 --> 02:44.498
Who gives them these names?

02:45.333 --> 02:47.134
I'll tell you something what.

02:47.868 --> 02:50.371
I give my left nut to
run into one of these
serial killer types.

02:52.039 --> 02:52.706
Yeah?

02:53.474 --> 02:55.108
God damn right.

02:55.376 --> 02:58.346
String them upside down like a
buck and skull fuck the bastard.

02:58.779 --> 02:59.980
See how he likes that.

03:00.481 --> 03:01.982
That's just down
the street from here.

03:02.450 --> 03:03.451
Yeah.

03:03.684 --> 03:04.685
Thank God we got out of there.

03:05.219 --> 03:06.454
I do not need any more overtime.

03:06.987 --> 03:08.856
- Cheers to that
- Right?

03:10.991 --> 03:12.293
Order up.

03:15.363 --> 03:17.898
Then you wouldn't
have any balls left.

03:18.131 --> 03:19.432
Huh?

03:19.433 --> 03:22.870
Because last week you said
that you'd give your right nut

03:23.504 --> 03:25.839
if the Colts won.

03:26.707 --> 03:28.409
You're a dipshit.

03:29.877 --> 03:30.878
Dipshit.

03:31.645 --> 03:32.746
Sorry.

03:33.381 --> 03:35.816
All right, your
mains are coming.

03:36.417 --> 03:37.518
Yo!

03:38.386 --> 03:39.820
Let's go.

03:41.154 --> 03:43.590
Yeah, I'm going to eat some food
in my belly's STAT.

03:43.591 --> 03:44.692
If anyone--

03:45.025 --> 03:46.894
You can just grab
a seat anywhere.

03:47.495 --> 03:48.528
Oh, OK.

03:48.529 --> 03:50.030
Right here, you want
to start right here?

03:50.764 --> 03:51.765
Fuck, be right here.

03:54.702 --> 03:57.437
Yeah, we're starving too, so--

03:57.438 --> 03:59.006
hurry that shit up!

03:59.940 --> 04:02.108
Well, I'm not even supposed
to be here right now.

04:02.109 --> 04:03.009
So--

04:03.010 --> 04:04.845
Hi, can I help you?

04:07.281 --> 04:09.683
I don't know, can you?

04:09.883 --> 04:12.620
Would you like to see a menu?

04:13.521 --> 04:16.957
Uh, it's good to see you.

04:18.292 --> 04:26.032
Sorry, it's been a long
night. Some things
didn't go as I had hoped--

04:26.033 --> 04:30.103
So, here we are--

04:33.974 --> 04:36.276
What do you got that's good?

04:36.477 --> 04:39.413
It's been said that we have
the best steak in the country.

04:41.315 --> 04:41.881
Oh shit.

04:41.882 --> 04:42.783
Wow

04:43.216 --> 04:44.217
The whole country?

04:44.452 --> 04:45.518
The whole country.

04:45.519 --> 04:50.324
Shit. All right. Maybe you'll
join me then.

04:52.726 --> 04:53.927
Join you?

04:54.161 --> 04:56.096
If I get the steak,
will you join me?

04:57.331 --> 04:58.432
Do you make it?

04:58.932 --> 04:59.800
I'm sorry?

05:00.468 --> 05:01.635
The steak, do you make it?

05:03.103 --> 05:04.171
No, there's--

05:05.639 --> 05:08.909
Oh, that's too bad.

05:11.979 --> 05:14.247
If you weren't
working, would you?

05:15.749 --> 05:16.616
Make you a steak?

05:16.617 --> 05:17.250
No.

05:18.452 --> 05:19.787
Eat with me.

05:20.187 --> 05:21.188
No.

05:22.322 --> 05:23.290
Why not?

05:23.491 --> 05:25.292
Uh, because I don't know you.

05:26.860 --> 05:29.463
Yeah, but we would--
that's how we would
get to know each other.

05:31.365 --> 05:32.432
Sit down--

05:32.433 --> 05:34.368
Right, that's what regular
people do, right?

05:34.602 --> 05:36.003
You don't strike me
as a regular person.

05:37.104 --> 05:38.105
So.

05:43.777 --> 05:45.211
I walked into that one.

05:45.212 --> 05:46.213
Mm-hmm.

05:47.381 --> 05:48.348
Right.

05:48.949 --> 05:50.217
No, you got a point.

05:51.284 --> 05:53.386
I'll grab a menu.

05:53.387 --> 05:54.555
Great.

05:54.855 --> 05:56.390
Oh, hey, hey.

06:02.295 --> 06:03.531
Coffee.

06:13.240 --> 06:17.177
You have pretty eyes.

06:31.091 --> 06:32.825
I don't know why you're
rolling out - I'm hungry

06:32.826 --> 06:33.593
Shut up.

06:33.594 --> 06:34.728
It's gonna fucking get you--

06:34.928 --> 06:35.862
I really want some fries--

06:35.863 --> 06:37.029
That's some weak ass shit--

06:37.030 --> 06:38.432
I don't know why
you see him anymore.

06:38.666 --> 06:39.867
Hi, can I get you
guys anything?

06:40.400 --> 06:41.133
You got booze?

06:41.134 --> 06:43.436
Uh, no, no booze. Just beer.

06:43.437 --> 06:44.571
I'll get you guys a menu.

06:44.572 --> 06:46.440
No, no, don't worry
about it, Mom.

06:47.207 --> 06:48.575
Dude, why are you
so fucking ass?

06:48.576 --> 06:49.576
Mom?

06:49.577 --> 06:50.710
She means you old.

06:50.711 --> 06:51.745
As Fuck.

06:52.279 --> 06:54.281
Oh, God, do you
see her groceries?

06:54.515 --> 06:55.949
Oh, fuck.

06:56.249 --> 06:58.719
That's so cute. Don't think you
can smoke that in here.

06:58.919 --> 06:59.952
All right, I'll get
you guys a beer.

06:59.953 --> 07:02.188
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
I know her.

07:02.189 --> 07:03.890
You know her?

07:03.891 --> 07:07.026
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Oh, my God.
You used to babysit my little
sister, right?

07:07.027 --> 07:09.429
Dude, her name was, uh, Anna.

07:09.630 --> 07:10.296
Anna, right?

07:10.297 --> 07:11.565
It's Anna.

07:11.765 --> 07:13.734
Anna, Nana. Holy
shit, dude, I know.

07:13.934 --> 07:15.001
All right, do you guys want
to eat or what?

07:15.002 --> 07:17.104
Um, I mean, but what the fuck
happened to you?

07:17.605 --> 07:18.805
What does that mean?

07:18.806 --> 07:21.074
I mean, you're here, all this
shit, begging for tips,

07:21.274 --> 07:24.478
like, weren't you supposed to be
a doctor or something?

07:24.778 --> 07:25.746
A nurse.

07:26.046 --> 07:27.314
Oh, my bad.

07:27.781 --> 07:29.817
Okay, so let me guess. Someone
knocked you up.

07:30.283 --> 07:31.885
Oh, shit.

07:32.786 --> 07:36.389
Nice. Okay, nice. Yeah, so
we'll get some menus then, yeah?

07:36.590 --> 07:38.258
And we'll take our time.

07:38.458 --> 07:39.226
And why don't you
run along there...

07:39.426 --> 07:40.494
Mom?

07:42.262 --> 07:43.463
Okay.

07:59.647 --> 08:01.749
What a bunch of assholes.

08:01.949 --> 08:03.115
Yeah, well.

08:03.116 --> 08:05.252
Look, I'm sorry. We got off
on that wrong foot.

08:06.119 --> 08:07.921
Feeling a little ornery tonight.

08:08.856 --> 08:09.656
So...

08:09.657 --> 08:10.824
No worries.

08:11.024 --> 08:12.526
I'm sure you're used to it.

08:13.093 --> 08:14.261
Wouldn't you know it?

08:14.461 --> 08:15.295
Right?

08:15.929 --> 08:16.930
I'm Charlie.

08:24.271 --> 08:28.308
I won't be needing that. I'll
have the steak.

08:52.199 --> 08:54.301
Oh, sorry I'm late, hon.

08:54.501 --> 08:56.002
Jakey's daddy called
me out of the blue.

08:56.003 --> 08:59.072
He said he needed a
lift, and I told him that
I had to go to work,

08:59.306 --> 09:00.908
but he said it was an emergency
and you know me.

09:01.174 --> 09:02.341
I'm a pleaser.

09:02.342 --> 09:04.578
So I pick him up, drive him all
the way across town.

09:04.878 --> 09:07.214
Through traffic, I get there and
I still might make it back,

09:07.414 --> 09:08.215
and guess what?

09:08.415 --> 09:09.181
What?

09:09.182 --> 09:10.550
He forgot his phantom stick.

09:11.251 --> 09:12.485
What's a phantom stick?

09:12.686 --> 09:14.387
It's a game controller thing.

09:14.588 --> 09:16.857
He calls it his phantom stick.
He won't play without it.

09:17.157 --> 09:18.391
A game controller?

09:18.592 --> 09:20.360
So I drive him
all the way back.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.863
You drove all the way back for
a game controller?

09:23.230 --> 09:25.565
You know me. I'm a pleaser.

09:25.933 --> 09:27.367
Okay, well, I gotta go.

09:27.735 --> 09:29.937
But just pick everything
up. That's fine.

09:30.170 --> 09:31.171
Sure, I'll save your tips.

09:31.371 --> 09:32.405
No, no, no. Split them.

09:32.606 --> 09:33.907
You're an angel,
you know that?

09:35.943 --> 09:37.444
How is it out there?

09:37.711 --> 09:39.747
Same, you know. A
bunch of drunk kids...

09:39.947 --> 09:44.084
Oh, watch out for nine.
The guy's a creep.

09:44.885 --> 09:46.119
There's no one there.

09:49.790 --> 09:51.291
Oh, motherfucker.

09:59.767 --> 10:01.735
Thought you stiffed us.

10:02.302 --> 10:04.638
I needed my fix.

10:05.405 --> 10:06.740
Care for a drag?

10:06.940 --> 10:08.541
Oh, no, thank
you. I don't smoke.

10:09.276 --> 10:12.913
It's all right. Neither do I.

10:13.947 --> 10:16.216
Except on certain occasions.

10:19.286 --> 10:21.388
How about that date?

10:23.223 --> 10:24.925
Look, um...

10:25.458 --> 10:26.459
My husband is--

10:26.660 --> 10:27.661
You're not married.

10:28.395 --> 10:29.897
You got no ring on your finger.

10:32.065 --> 10:36.169
My boyfriend is
waiting for me.

10:38.438 --> 10:39.807
Wow.

10:42.009 --> 10:43.443
You have a good night.

10:46.646 --> 10:47.915
I will scream.

10:48.581 --> 10:49.582
Why?

10:50.818 --> 10:52.152
Let's just have a chat.

10:52.953 --> 10:55.588
Platonically, outside work.

11:22.515 --> 11:24.852
Stop following me.

11:26.053 --> 11:27.487
Truck.

11:28.722 --> 11:30.858
Right there.

11:33.827 --> 11:34.962
Go ahead.

11:44.471 --> 11:45.472
Actually...

11:46.907 --> 11:48.842
Why don't you come with me?

11:50.243 --> 11:54.714
No dice. You'll be on
the ground before anybody
comes through that door

11:54.915 --> 11:56.383
and i will be gone.

12:04.257 --> 12:07.995
I just want to have
a talk. That's all.

12:08.996 --> 12:12.199
Please, I have a little girl.

12:13.200 --> 12:16.269
Now, that is the first
time you have told me
the truth all night.

12:34.254 --> 12:35.421
I'm sorry if I always like--

12:35.422 --> 12:37.290
Could you ever see yourself
with a guy like me?

12:38.558 --> 12:40.393
Sure. Absolutely.

12:42.462 --> 12:43.463
No.

12:45.398 --> 12:46.967
No, you're just saying that.

12:52.105 --> 12:53.440
I'll save you the trouble.

12:54.607 --> 12:56.810
You'd need vice grips
to get that open.

13:03.083 --> 13:05.052
Look, I've just--

13:05.252 --> 13:15.228
I've had just like a
shit day, but I would love to
do something tomorrow.

13:16.964 --> 13:18.565
Yeah?

13:19.299 --> 13:20.333
Yeah. We could--

13:20.800 --> 13:22.102
There's this place
on Third Street.

13:23.136 --> 13:24.136
It's so much better than here.

13:24.137 --> 13:30.477
And we could like
have a proper dinner.

13:32.645 --> 13:33.981
Sounds nice.

13:36.149 --> 13:37.450
But you work tomorrow.

13:37.985 --> 13:39.953
I do. You're right.

13:40.988 --> 13:47.627
But I would-- I could
take the day off no problem.
I am due a night out.

13:50.697 --> 13:51.999
What would we do?

13:53.533 --> 13:55.768
Oh, man. Okay. So you--

13:56.503 --> 13:59.006
You'd pick me up at eight.

13:59.272 --> 14:01.875
What would you wear?

14:03.010 --> 14:04.644
I have this--

14:06.679 --> 14:11.184
I have this sexy outfit that I
wear only for special occasions.

14:11.451 --> 14:15.288
It's like a little mini skirt,
a halter top.

14:16.990 --> 14:18.992
What about your underwear?

14:21.528 --> 14:25.365
It's great. You
have to wait and see.

14:28.301 --> 14:33.173
I want the ones with Teddy
Bear's on them.

14:36.143 --> 14:37.044
You know?

14:37.244 --> 14:39.079
Mm-hmm. Okay.

14:40.247 --> 14:44.584
Okay. Let's wait till
tomorrow, right? We're
going to do tomorrow.

14:51.324 --> 14:53.193
Just tell me you want me.

14:55.062 --> 14:56.096
No.

14:57.597 --> 15:00.667
Tell me you want
me inside you.

15:00.867 --> 15:03.236
- Please. Tomorrow
- No

15:06.273 --> 15:13.280
Just tell me that you
want to feel me inside you
and I'll let you go.

15:14.681 --> 15:16.083
And then we'll talk tomorrow.

15:22.255 --> 15:26.526
Okay. Yeah. Okay.

15:30.430 --> 15:31.431
I--

15:34.267 --> 15:35.268
want

15:37.304 --> 15:39.372
I-- I-- I want--

15:44.277 --> 15:45.778
To feel you...

15:47.314 --> 15:48.315
I want to feel you inside me.

15:49.282 --> 15:51.417
There you go.

16:08.735 --> 16:10.002
It's not a fucking
cartoon, Gary.

16:13.406 --> 16:14.607
Hey, could you turn that up?

16:15.775 --> 16:17.277
This isn't your
living room, you know.

16:18.645 --> 16:20.313
Oh, well, if it were, you'd
have beer in your

16:20.513 --> 16:21.848
hand, you'd be about ready to
give me a foot rub.

16:22.149 --> 16:23.416
Oh, yeah? What about Gary?

16:24.417 --> 16:25.452
Gary don't like foot rubs.

16:25.752 --> 16:27.487
Hey, I'd like a foot rub.

16:27.687 --> 16:28.621
Shut the fuck up, Gary.

16:30.990 --> 16:33.793
That's right.
This is gruesome news here in
the Heights.

16:34.327 --> 16:37.364
As far as we know, two are
dead and one is
critically injured.

16:37.930 --> 16:39.766
The injured individuals
think Rush to St.
Mary's

16:39.966 --> 16:42.369
Hospital is currently
fighting for their lives.

16:43.036 --> 16:46.506
Eyewitness accounts report
an older model pickup truck
leaving the scene.

16:47.140 --> 16:48.108
Hey!

16:48.308 --> 16:49.276
Not tonight, huh?

16:50.477 --> 16:52.445
Oh, you couldn't sit anywhere.

16:54.314 --> 16:58.385
Jesus, the "mangler" who
comes up with these names?

16:59.886 --> 17:01.288
I'll tell you something, what?

17:24.311 --> 17:26.713
Then you wouldn't
have any balls left.

17:28.181 --> 17:29.749
Huh?

17:30.383 --> 17:33.986
Because last week you said
that you'd give your right nut

17:34.321 --> 17:35.822
if the colts won.

17:38.525 --> 17:39.526
You're a dipshit.

17:40.227 --> 17:41.228
Dipshit.

17:43.696 --> 17:44.997
You got a problem?

18:04.217 --> 18:07.120
Yo!

18:08.888 --> 18:12.792
Oh, yeah, I'm going to need some
more of my belly STAT

18:14.261 --> 18:15.728
Just grab a seat anywhere.

18:25.372 --> 18:26.606
Yeah, we starving too, so...

18:27.640 --> 18:29.642
hurry that shit up!

18:42.289 --> 18:44.791
Well, I'm not even supposed to
be here right now. So...

18:45.658 --> 18:46.659
Hi, can I help you?

18:49.729 --> 18:50.730
Hi.

18:53.166 --> 18:55.067
What is it today?

18:55.568 --> 18:58.004
It's the 15th.

19:00.740 --> 19:02.575
So Thursday, right?

19:03.310 --> 19:04.911
Couple more hours, yeah.

19:07.314 --> 19:08.281
And...

19:10.517 --> 19:11.518
You don't know...

19:12.619 --> 19:13.620
Me.

19:15.288 --> 19:16.789
I'm sorry, have we met?

19:20.793 --> 19:23.196
That's a good question.

19:28.368 --> 19:30.169
Is everything okay?

19:34.441 --> 19:35.542
I don't know.

19:38.211 --> 19:38.945
Sir?

19:39.979 --> 19:41.013
Sorry, is it...

19:42.048 --> 19:43.650
Ever get deja vu?

19:46.319 --> 19:47.620
Every night, yeah.

19:51.991 --> 19:52.992
Yeah.

19:53.826 --> 19:54.827
Yeah.

19:56.796 --> 19:57.530
Huh.

19:58.698 --> 19:59.732
Coffee?

20:06.373 --> 20:08.475
You have pretty eyes.

20:09.476 --> 20:10.477
Thanks.

20:11.478 --> 20:12.912
Would you like to see a menu?

20:15.382 --> 20:17.417
I hear you have great steak.

20:18.351 --> 20:19.919
Best in the country, yup.

20:21.754 --> 20:22.722
I'll have that.

20:23.022 --> 20:24.357
Thank you.

20:51.284 --> 20:52.952
How's your night?

21:02.429 --> 21:03.430
Do you, uh...

21:04.931 --> 21:06.466
Remember any of this?

21:11.304 --> 21:14.441
Oh, the strong silent type.

21:15.308 --> 21:16.309
Okay.

21:17.944 --> 21:19.211
Doesn't talk that much.

21:19.946 --> 21:21.047
I can get behind that.

21:22.315 --> 21:24.751
But see, I recognize you.

21:25.618 --> 21:27.153
Like you're familiar to me.

21:30.056 --> 21:31.324
Have you been on TV?

21:33.760 --> 21:36.095
If you're a cop,
you have to tell me.

21:37.664 --> 21:38.831
It's the law.

21:49.308 --> 21:51.110
I get it.

21:52.011 --> 21:52.912
Let's see.

21:54.113 --> 21:54.847
Don't worry.

21:56.315 --> 21:57.984
I've got a good memory.

22:32.385 --> 22:33.686
Thought you stiffed us.

22:34.621 --> 22:35.655
I needed my fix.

22:36.789 --> 22:37.790
Care for a drag?

22:38.791 --> 22:39.425
Sorry. That's right.

22:39.426 --> 22:41.060
You don't smoke, right?

22:41.794 --> 22:42.462
Right.

22:42.662 --> 22:44.464
Right.

22:47.534 --> 22:50.403
Well, I don't usually, but
beautiful night, huh?

22:51.971 --> 22:52.972
Sure.

22:53.640 --> 22:55.041
Kinda worth living twice.

23:00.413 --> 23:01.914
What do you see when
you look up there?

23:05.017 --> 23:06.018
I don't see anything.

23:07.587 --> 23:08.555
Supposed to be a...

23:09.922 --> 23:11.924
vast universe full of wonder.

23:13.192 --> 23:14.527
I just see dots.

23:18.665 --> 23:19.566
Great.

23:20.433 --> 23:21.901
Have a good night. All right?

23:27.273 --> 23:28.541
Mm-hmm.

23:45.625 --> 23:47.460
Can I help you?

23:49.596 --> 23:50.963
Sorry. Just...

23:51.731 --> 23:53.132
going to my pickup.

23:54.266 --> 23:55.602
Oh, okay. Well,
why don't you...

23:55.968 --> 23:56.969
Go ahead.

23:59.271 --> 24:00.272
Right.

24:02.609 --> 24:03.910
You know what?

24:06.613 --> 24:07.814
Why don't you just come with me?

24:13.886 --> 24:14.887
No.

24:15.321 --> 24:16.322
No dice.

24:16.623 --> 24:18.290
You will be spitting blood...

24:19.492 --> 24:21.160
...before they get to that door.

24:24.263 --> 24:25.264
Look at me.

24:27.266 --> 24:28.735
I just want to talk.

24:29.769 --> 24:30.637
That's it.

24:31.504 --> 24:32.839
I have a little girl.

24:34.774 --> 24:35.975
I know.

24:38.177 --> 24:39.679
Let's go for a ride.

25:00.667 --> 25:02.168
Hey, can you turn that up?

25:02.702 --> 25:03.936
No!

25:05.371 --> 25:06.438
Jesus.

25:07.940 --> 25:10.042
You're fucking with me.

25:10.677 --> 25:13.445
Y'all... you're all
fucking with me.

25:14.046 --> 25:15.281
Who the hell are you?

25:18.017 --> 25:19.118
You know me.

25:22.021 --> 25:24.156
And you're fucking with me.

25:24.691 --> 25:26.826
Hmm? Aren't y'all?

25:27.860 --> 25:28.695
Sir?

25:28.895 --> 25:29.696
You--

25:32.331 --> 25:33.065
You.

25:35.835 --> 25:36.803
You.

25:39.305 --> 25:41.040
You, okay?

25:42.842 --> 25:43.441
Okay.

25:43.442 --> 25:44.577
This is a good joke.

25:45.411 --> 25:46.412
Bravo.

25:49.048 --> 25:50.049
Lift it up.

25:50.549 --> 25:52.885
Hey, man, that's not...

25:53.085 --> 25:54.854
I said shut the fuck up!

25:56.388 --> 25:57.223
Lift it up!

25:58.758 --> 26:00.092
Lift up your shirt!

26:00.426 --> 26:02.895
All right, now. I've had
about enough of it.

26:06.432 --> 26:08.100
I said...

26:18.410 --> 26:21.614
Lift up your fucking
shirt, or I'm gonna put a
bullet in your brain.

26:31.023 --> 26:32.024
Nothing.

26:37.764 --> 26:38.731
Nothing!

26:41.433 --> 26:42.434
There's...

26:43.903 --> 26:45.237
nothing.

26:48.741 --> 26:50.810
Who are you?

26:51.110 --> 26:52.078
Huh?

26:52.879 --> 26:55.782
What the fuck is that?

26:58.317 --> 26:59.085
Okay.

26:59.551 --> 27:00.419
Uh, okay.

27:00.653 --> 27:03.790
We are closed tonight!

27:13.232 --> 27:15.133
Dip shit.

27:17.269 --> 27:18.805
Hey, you can turn that up.

27:20.239 --> 27:21.841
You fucking shot me.

27:22.074 --> 27:23.843
This isn't your
living room, you know.

27:24.310 --> 27:26.312
Oh, if it were,
you'd have beer in your

27:26.512 --> 27:27.679
hand and you'd be about ready
to give me a...

27:27.680 --> 27:28.681
Hey!

27:30.349 --> 27:31.918
You fucking shot me!

27:32.785 --> 27:33.786
Sir, are...

27:33.986 --> 27:35.121
Fuck you too!

27:35.988 --> 27:36.655
Hey, man...

27:36.856 --> 27:37.690
And fuck you!

27:40.259 --> 27:41.260
Fuck you.

27:47.266 --> 27:50.669
Hey, man, don't talk to the
lady like that.

27:52.805 --> 27:54.707
Shut the fuck up Gary.

28:20.900 --> 28:21.868
Hey, can you
just turn that up?

28:22.735 --> 28:24.336
Noooooo!

28:35.514 --> 28:37.750
No!

28:40.753 --> 28:42.088
No!

28:49.328 --> 28:51.230
No!

29:02.274 --> 29:03.541
Hey, can you
just turn that up?

29:09.448 --> 29:11.417
You son of a bitch.

29:11.617 --> 29:12.919
Turn that up, you fuck!

29:13.219 --> 29:14.120
Turn it up.

29:15.521 --> 29:16.454
No.

29:16.455 --> 29:18.524
You don't get to
disrespect me like that.

29:45.051 --> 29:46.585
Hey could you turn that up?

29:47.253 --> 29:49.588
This isn't your
living room, you know.

29:50.089 --> 29:52.091
Oh, if it was, you'd have
a beer in your hand

29:52.291 --> 29:53.492
and you'd be about ready to
give me a foot rub.

29:53.725 --> 29:54.293
Oh, yeah.

29:54.493 --> 29:55.461
What about Gary?

29:56.628 --> 29:57.729
Gary don't like foot rubs.

29:57.964 --> 29:59.631
Hey, I'd like a foot rub.

29:59.832 --> 30:00.666
Shut the fuck up, Gary.

30:01.067 --> 30:02.133
That's right.

30:02.134 --> 30:03.801
It's a gruesome scene here
in the Heights.

30:03.802 --> 30:05.603
As far as we know, two were
dead,

30:05.604 --> 30:07.072
and one is
critically injured.

30:07.073 --> 30:10.241
The injured individual is
being rushed to St.
Mary's Hospital

30:10.242 --> 30:12.243
and is currently fighting
for their life.

30:12.244 --> 30:15.346
Eyewitness accounts report
an older model pickup truck

30:15.347 --> 30:16.815
leaving the scene.

30:17.016 --> 30:18.984
It is still preliminary,
but with the midnight

30:18.985 --> 30:20.086
mangler on the loose--

30:20.286 --> 30:22.254
Not tonight, huh?

30:22.454 --> 30:23.990
Jesus Christ.

30:24.623 --> 30:26.959
"Mangler", who gives
them these names?

30:27.159 --> 30:28.360
I'll tell you something what...

30:28.694 --> 30:30.596
That's just down
the street from there.

30:30.796 --> 30:32.031
Thank God we got out of there.

30:32.264 --> 30:33.832
I do not need any more overtime.

30:34.867 --> 30:36.335
Cheers to that.

30:42.841 --> 30:46.178
Cause you, um, cause last
week you said that

30:46.378 --> 30:49.882
you'd give me a right nut
if the Colts won,

30:50.349 --> 30:53.185
and then the Colts won.

30:53.385 --> 30:54.353
You're a dipshit.

30:55.454 --> 30:56.188
Just saying.

30:56.388 --> 30:57.189
Dipshit.

31:06.032 --> 31:07.633
Can I help you?

31:08.234 --> 31:09.401
Hi.

31:10.069 --> 31:11.737
Can I help you?

31:13.239 --> 31:14.473
I'm good for right now.

31:14.673 --> 31:16.042
Thank you.

31:16.242 --> 31:19.045
Sorry, you can't sit there
and not order food.

31:19.511 --> 31:20.512
Right.

31:22.915 --> 31:24.316
I'll have a cup.

31:30.089 --> 31:31.890
What do you think?

31:32.091 --> 31:33.059
About what?

31:34.360 --> 31:35.361
This.

31:36.062 --> 31:38.664
This is real, right?

31:39.531 --> 31:41.100
As far as I know, yeah.

31:41.567 --> 31:42.568
How do you know?

31:42.768 --> 31:44.269
That this is real?

31:44.270 --> 31:48.174
I mean, the coffee's
hot, the night's long, the
customers are weird.

31:48.374 --> 31:49.441
What more do you need?

31:54.046 --> 31:55.447
I think you're right.

31:56.715 --> 31:59.251
Well, that is very comforting.

32:02.354 --> 32:03.055
hmm

32:03.255 --> 32:04.723
What?

32:07.793 --> 32:10.629
On second thought,
I'll have a steak.

32:11.597 --> 32:12.598
It's a great choice.

32:20.472 --> 32:22.708
Yeah.

32:36.422 --> 32:38.890
You know, I still
haven't placed you.

32:39.458 --> 32:41.994
But I'll get it.

32:46.265 --> 32:47.966
What would you do?

32:49.168 --> 32:50.502
If you were me.

32:52.338 --> 32:53.772
Let me ask you that.

32:56.575 --> 33:02.748
See, because I'm caught in
like this time loop.

33:05.117 --> 33:06.185
Like a hiccup in time?

33:07.286 --> 33:10.156
It's a record scratch.

33:11.357 --> 33:12.658
That just keeps like...

33:13.925 --> 33:16.495
It just keeps repeating.

33:19.031 --> 33:19.998
So...

33:22.501 --> 33:24.303
What would you do?

33:41.687 --> 33:44.156
Yeah?

33:48.194 --> 33:49.528
Good talk.

34:18.324 --> 34:19.225
I...

34:19.425 --> 34:21.727
No, I... I don't think I can...

34:21.927 --> 34:22.660
Come on, why not?

34:22.661 --> 34:24.363
Look, honey, I'm worried.

34:24.563 --> 34:25.397
I don't know that I can.

34:25.597 --> 34:26.232
I just...

34:26.532 --> 34:27.199
Hi.

34:27.399 --> 34:28.234
Can I help you?

34:29.335 --> 34:30.336
I don't know.

34:30.536 --> 34:31.503
Can you?

34:32.538 --> 34:34.240
What is this?

34:34.440 --> 34:35.274
Is this date night?

34:35.741 --> 34:36.742
Yeah, so?

34:37.209 --> 34:38.676
You guys having a good time?

34:38.677 --> 34:40.912
Look, pal, I don't
know who you are. Can
you just get out of...

34:41.113 --> 34:42.613
Let's not get all bothered.

34:42.614 --> 34:45.884
All right? I just came
to say hi and to get to
know you a little bit.

34:47.119 --> 34:48.887
Why?

34:49.221 --> 34:50.622
You guys married?

34:51.022 --> 34:52.023
Uh...

34:52.258 --> 34:53.392
Okay, look.

34:53.625 --> 34:54.726
It doesn't matter to you.

34:54.926 --> 34:55.694
No, I'm asking her.

34:55.894 --> 34:56.795
Shut the fuck up.

34:58.797 --> 35:00.299
Why is that a hard question?

35:01.900 --> 35:04.236
We're not married.

35:07.306 --> 35:08.807
Would you mind if
I eat with you then?

35:09.107 --> 35:10.041
Yeah.

35:10.276 --> 35:11.209
Yeah, we mind.

35:11.210 --> 35:12.244
We're trying to
have a nice night.

35:12.444 --> 35:13.712
Me too.

35:23.489 --> 35:24.790
Okay, okay.

35:24.990 --> 35:25.957
Fuck you.

35:26.158 --> 35:27.759
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

35:27.959 --> 35:28.827
Oh, shit.

35:29.060 --> 35:30.128
Shut the fuck up

35:30.896 --> 35:31.897
Sit down.

35:32.898 --> 35:33.999
Sit down.

35:34.500 --> 35:35.233
All right?

35:35.234 --> 35:37.336
Put your goddamn hands down.

35:38.337 --> 35:39.471
Look, have a seat.

35:39.671 --> 35:40.606
Shh.

35:40.939 --> 35:42.774
I don't want any trouble, man.

35:45.744 --> 35:46.445
Okay.

35:47.313 --> 35:47.945
Listen.

35:47.946 --> 35:49.448
You guys are married.

35:50.982 --> 35:52.584
Just not to each other.

35:57.323 --> 35:58.290
Right?

36:02.761 --> 36:04.530
Your wife sent me.

36:05.096 --> 36:06.597
Shit.

36:06.598 --> 36:08.634
And I'm supposed to
leave your body out the
dumpster in the back.

36:08.834 --> 36:10.202
How do you feel about that?

36:10.436 --> 36:11.303
Okay, man.

36:11.937 --> 36:13.505
Just, here, I got money.

36:13.705 --> 36:14.839
Sure you do.

36:14.840 --> 36:17.343
Not even my type, but I think
this could be fun.

36:23.315 --> 36:24.049
Oh, shit.

36:24.983 --> 36:26.184
Food's here.

36:30.356 --> 36:31.790
Okay.

36:36.228 --> 36:38.497
I was just fucking with you all.

36:39.331 --> 36:41.533
Have a good night.

36:41.733 --> 36:43.201
Really.

36:43.635 --> 36:47.005
- So my wife didn't--
- Didn't hire me to kill you?

36:47.573 --> 36:48.374
No.

36:48.674 --> 36:49.808
No!

36:50.041 --> 36:52.244
I'm just supposed
to break your arm.

36:55.381 --> 36:56.482
Fucking with you again.

36:56.715 --> 36:57.583
No.

36:58.417 --> 36:59.751
I'm going to kill you.

37:02.254 --> 37:03.255
Not really.

37:03.689 --> 37:04.390
I don't know.

37:04.590 --> 37:05.257
Anyways, look.

37:07.359 --> 37:09.160
Have a good night.

37:09.361 --> 37:10.028
Enjoy.

37:10.529 --> 37:12.097
On me.

37:12.598 --> 37:17.569
And, you know, maybe you can
do that thing you talked about.

37:22.674 --> 37:23.875
One more thing.

37:25.010 --> 37:26.177
Forget I'm here.

37:29.948 --> 37:31.449
Ah.

37:31.450 --> 37:35.020
Gotta love it when you
get back to your table
and your food is ready.

37:42.761 --> 37:44.963
You mean Edna and Gretchen?

37:45.196 --> 37:46.064
Yeah, Gretchen.

37:46.264 --> 37:47.398
All day, every day.

37:47.399 --> 37:49.301
Gretchen at least jokes when
she craps herself.

37:49.535 --> 37:51.737
Like she at least
knows what she's doing.

37:51.937 --> 37:53.071
Edna has to...

37:56.141 --> 37:57.609
Excuse me.

37:59.611 --> 38:00.446
Hi.

38:01.279 --> 38:02.714
I saw you...

38:03.214 --> 38:04.215
At the bathroom.

38:05.951 --> 38:06.652
Yeah.

38:09.588 --> 38:10.756
You all from here?

38:10.956 --> 38:13.091
Sorry, you can't
just sit there.

38:14.292 --> 38:15.327
Why not?

38:17.295 --> 38:18.430
Nurses?

38:20.165 --> 38:22.000
I can tell by the outfit
you're wearing.

38:22.334 --> 38:23.335
Smocks

38:23.735 --> 38:24.903
You mean scrubs.

38:27.773 --> 38:29.107
Sorry I'm not from here.

38:29.741 --> 38:31.009
What, America?

38:33.011 --> 38:34.980
- That's funny
- Yeah

38:41.753 --> 38:43.188
You need to try this steak.

38:43.422 --> 38:44.823
We were actually just leaving.

38:45.491 --> 38:46.658
I'm sorry to hear that.

38:48.694 --> 38:49.828
You want me to walk you out?

38:50.028 --> 38:51.096
There's a lot of
bad guys out there.

38:51.363 --> 38:52.330
Hey, Anna.

38:52.531 --> 38:53.499
We're all done.

38:54.766 --> 38:55.533
Hey.

38:55.534 --> 38:56.868
No more outside than in here.

38:57.202 --> 38:58.504
Thanks buddy, we're good.

39:12.884 --> 39:13.885
Hey.

39:14.352 --> 39:15.821
I'm just going
out for a smoke.

39:39.511 --> 39:40.546
Hey, can you turn that up?

39:40.879 --> 39:41.913
I got it.

39:48.253 --> 39:53.024
Another example of the
scientific community pushing
boundries in this critical field

39:53.224 --> 39:56.194
We're really
doing great work.

39:58.029 --> 40:00.565
We have a developing story
in the southeast heights where

40:00.566 --> 40:03.068
our Alex Castillo is
standing by with the latest.

40:06.705 --> 40:08.574
That's a shame.

40:11.042 --> 40:13.078
Excuse me.

40:15.280 --> 40:16.715
Well, hello.

40:17.248 --> 40:20.018
- You're not supposed to--
- You come here often?

40:20.351 --> 40:21.620
I mean, I do.

40:21.920 --> 40:26.291
Just a regular old-- regular?

40:27.192 --> 40:28.860
Sorry, do I know you?

40:29.260 --> 40:30.295
I don't know.

40:30.862 --> 40:31.930
Does she?

40:32.297 --> 40:32.898
Do you?

40:33.198 --> 40:34.398
Okay, yeah.

40:34.399 --> 40:35.867
You're not supposed to be back
here, so if you could--

40:36.067 --> 40:36.935
Of course.

40:39.070 --> 40:40.071
I'll have a beer.

40:40.972 --> 40:42.440
And watch out for that guy.

40:43.642 --> 40:44.643
Lock your doors.

40:47.646 --> 40:48.614
Fucking asshole.

40:49.915 --> 40:51.717
Goddamn right.

40:51.917 --> 40:54.486
I'd string him upside
down like a buck and
skull fuck the bastard.

40:54.720 --> 40:56.221
See how he likes that.

40:56.622 --> 40:58.757
- Yeah, then you wouldn't have
any--
- Balls left.

41:00.225 --> 41:02.093
You know what I'd do to him?

41:02.293 --> 41:04.929
I'd tie him to the back
of my truck and I'd
drag him around the block

41:04.930 --> 41:06.732
until he was all tore up.

41:07.298 --> 41:09.901
And then I'd dump gasoline on
him and I'd light his ass up.

41:11.002 --> 41:12.804
But I'd have a fire
extinguisher with me.

41:13.772 --> 41:15.105
And I'd douse him with it.

41:15.106 --> 41:17.509
I'd put him out just before he
died and I'd let him sit in it.

41:19.144 --> 41:20.612
And then I'd do
it all over again.

41:23.749 --> 41:24.816
What are ya'll drinking?

41:25.150 --> 41:26.518
I'll buy you beers.

41:26.785 --> 41:28.085
Hmm?

41:28.086 --> 41:29.755
It's good to be
around like-minded people
like yourselves,

41:29.955 --> 41:30.989
you know what I mean?

41:34.993 --> 41:35.693
Midnight Mangler.

41:35.694 --> 41:37.696
It's a hell of a moniker.

41:37.929 --> 41:38.664
Right?

41:38.864 --> 41:39.497
What do you think, man?

41:39.698 --> 41:40.632
Good?

41:40.832 --> 41:41.599
Catchy?

41:41.600 --> 41:42.834
What do you think he looks like?

41:45.270 --> 41:46.672
We'll have three more beers.

41:50.041 --> 41:50.642
Hey.

41:51.543 --> 41:52.743
We should do it.

41:52.744 --> 41:54.880
We should definitely, definitely
do it to three of us.

41:55.113 --> 41:57.182
- Do what?
- Catch the son of a bitch.

41:57.382 --> 41:59.350
I'm not into the skull fucking.

41:59.551 --> 42:01.051
I'm really not.

42:01.052 --> 42:03.789
I'll let you figure
that part out, but we should
definitely do it.

42:05.991 --> 42:11.362
How do you keep the teeth
from scraping
the... your... when you... doin it?

42:11.563 --> 42:13.565
- The fuck are you
talking about?
- The skull fucking!

42:13.799 --> 42:14.666
The skull fucking.

42:15.000 --> 42:16.301
That's right.

42:16.702 --> 42:19.671
Listen, mister, I can't listen
to this anymore.

42:19.871 --> 42:21.539
This is a bit much for me.

42:21.973 --> 42:22.573
Yeah, you know what?

42:22.574 --> 42:23.675
Hey, keep that cold.

42:24.309 --> 42:25.376
I'll be right back.

43:24.069 --> 43:26.872
Wait a minute.

43:28.239 --> 43:30.642
I'm still here

43:31.777 --> 43:33.779
Now what the fuck?

43:51.763 --> 43:53.965
Hey, hey, hey.

43:54.165 --> 43:57.836
What are you doing in the
ladies' restroom?

43:58.403 --> 43:59.337
Oh.

43:59.671 --> 44:00.972
That's my cart too.

44:01.239 --> 44:02.974
What the hell are you
doing with my cart?

44:03.174 --> 44:04.642
Well... it was bad...

44:06.912 --> 44:10.015
you did get it
cleaned all up then?

44:10.782 --> 44:11.582
Yeah.

44:13.318 --> 44:13.952
Okay.

44:14.986 --> 44:15.921
Step aside.

44:16.855 --> 44:17.522
Hey, look.

44:18.690 --> 44:20.125
I better take it.

44:21.359 --> 44:22.693
Trust me.

44:22.694 --> 44:25.096
If you're worried about the
shit around here, don't worry.

44:25.296 --> 44:26.197
I'll do the shit all the time.

44:26.431 --> 44:27.131
How about this?

44:27.132 --> 44:28.834
Let's just get it outside.

44:29.034 --> 44:30.201
I'll help you.

44:33.171 --> 44:34.605
That fucking Russian,

44:34.806 --> 44:37.876
I tell him every fucking time
that the white boys,

44:38.109 --> 44:40.812
they can't handle the
fucking carne asada.

44:41.512 --> 44:42.680
What is this?

44:42.981 --> 44:45.283
It's so fucking
heavy, a la verga.

44:46.484 --> 44:47.953
I told you.

44:49.855 --> 44:51.056
What the fuck?

44:51.289 --> 44:52.223
¿Que Chinga?

44:52.457 --> 44:52.958
What the fuck?

44:59.497 --> 45:02.000
I told you it was messy.

45:02.500 --> 45:04.035
Sophie?

45:07.138 --> 45:08.006
Hey.

45:08.306 --> 45:09.741
Did you see my friend?

45:12.043 --> 45:12.811
No.

45:13.011 --> 45:14.312
What, is she missing?

45:14.579 --> 45:16.014
Her car's still here, but...

45:21.086 --> 45:22.253
Damn, that's weird.

45:23.755 --> 45:25.223
I got my pickup over there.

45:25.423 --> 45:29.227
I could drive you around the
block and look for her.

45:29.560 --> 45:31.196
She's probably around her, so...

45:35.733 --> 45:37.435
No, I'm good.

45:38.069 --> 45:38.870
- You sure?
- Yeah

45:39.070 --> 45:39.905
Okay.

45:44.776 --> 45:45.777
Good luck.

46:00.258 --> 46:02.127
Red.

46:05.230 --> 46:06.798
You better not give me shit
about Sarah, okay?

46:07.032 --> 46:08.934
Because you're the one how be
dating gargoyles.

46:09.134 --> 46:09.800
What are you talking about?

46:09.801 --> 46:10.667
Like this?

46:10.668 --> 46:13.138
Yeah. Lisa, are
you kidding me?

46:27.285 --> 46:30.421
It's goddamn good
to be alive, huh?

46:31.089 --> 46:32.457
You want another one?

46:32.657 --> 46:33.925
I'll get you all another one.

46:34.125 --> 46:34.826
Hey.

46:35.093 --> 46:35.961
Three more, please.

46:38.796 --> 46:40.165
Did you hear that outside?

46:40.398 --> 46:41.666
It sounded like gunfire.

46:42.968 --> 46:43.734
Nope.

46:45.937 --> 46:47.105
Maybe it was the manger.

46:49.841 --> 46:50.741
We should go.

46:50.976 --> 46:51.676
We got work to do.

46:51.910 --> 46:52.643
Let's do this.

46:54.612 --> 46:55.646
Unless you're scared.

46:56.647 --> 46:57.648
Shut up, dipshit.

46:59.985 --> 47:01.152
Okey-dokey.

47:02.620 --> 47:03.954
This is your last round.

47:03.955 --> 47:07.859
After this, if you want more,
go to Lucky's. It's not a bar.

47:08.159 --> 47:09.527
Come on, Anna.

47:09.961 --> 47:12.964
I'm not dragging your pony ass
out of here again.

47:13.664 --> 47:16.301
I can't go back to Lucky's.

47:17.335 --> 47:18.169
Why not?

47:20.171 --> 47:21.506
What was that?

47:22.507 --> 47:23.875
Nothing.

47:27.778 --> 47:29.280
Hey, any luck?

47:29.480 --> 47:30.215
No, it's the strangest thing.

47:31.516 --> 47:32.517
What?

47:33.151 --> 47:34.152
Sophie's missing

47:34.552 --> 47:36.187
What do you mean missing?

47:36.454 --> 47:39.157
Well, she went to the bathroom
and then she just disappeared.

47:39.490 --> 47:40.892
Is her car still here?

47:41.126 --> 47:42.327
Yeah.

47:42.560 --> 47:44.629
Any of you knuckleheads
see anything?

47:48.566 --> 47:49.667
He was outside.

47:51.202 --> 47:52.237
Having a smoke.

47:55.340 --> 47:56.241
All right.

47:58.143 --> 47:59.144
Well, good luck with all that.

48:01.579 --> 48:02.647
Why didn't she tell me?

48:02.847 --> 48:03.547
Okay, you know what?

48:03.548 --> 48:04.715
I'm going to be off soon.

48:05.183 --> 48:06.351
I'll drive you, okay?

48:06.751 --> 48:08.186
- It's fucking weird, right?
- Yeah

48:08.586 --> 48:09.654
I'm dying here, okay?

48:09.921 --> 48:11.522
Babe, I got needs.

48:11.756 --> 48:13.024
He's getting suspicious.

48:15.560 --> 48:16.761
It just feels like you don't
want to spend--

48:16.995 --> 48:17.728
What are you doing, man?

48:17.929 --> 48:18.663
Fuck.

48:18.863 --> 48:19.564
What?

48:19.764 --> 48:20.731
Oh, sorry.

48:21.032 --> 48:21.933
No, don't mind me.

48:22.167 --> 48:23.367
Keep going.

48:23.368 --> 48:25.503
You were saying how she doesn't
prioritize your needs.

48:25.703 --> 48:27.205
How does that make you feel?

48:28.739 --> 48:30.541
Hey, look, it's
been a long night.

48:30.741 --> 48:32.243
I need a little entertainment,
you know what I mean?

48:32.443 --> 48:33.410
Okay, come on, man.

48:33.411 --> 48:34.445
If you don't mind
your own business--

48:48.693 --> 48:52.263
If I don't mind my
own business, what?

49:02.974 --> 49:05.876
If a man commits adultery with
another, the man, the woman,

49:06.244 --> 49:10.148
the adulterer and the adulteress
have to be put to death.

49:11.282 --> 49:13.784
Leviticus 20.10,
it's in the Bible.

49:14.285 --> 49:15.553
Do you read the Bible?

49:16.154 --> 49:16.721
Well, it's in there.

49:19.724 --> 49:23.261
Oh, ah, sorry.

49:23.561 --> 49:27.898
I just tipped my hit my thing
on the-- hit the-- right?

49:28.499 --> 49:29.100
You ever get that?

49:29.300 --> 49:30.335
Whoo.

49:30.568 --> 49:31.336
All right.

49:31.769 --> 49:32.437
Well--

49:34.139 --> 49:35.173
Oh, no.

49:36.507 --> 49:37.975
You okay?

49:38.309 --> 49:39.376
You okay?

49:39.377 --> 49:41.912
I think he's had a little
too much to drink.

49:42.113 --> 49:43.748
Can we call a cab for him?

49:44.515 --> 49:45.382
And you know what?

49:45.383 --> 49:46.917
I'm gonna kill for
some ice cream.

49:47.652 --> 49:49.687
Oh, my God, ma'am,
ma'am, are you okay?

49:50.021 --> 49:50.520
Are you--

49:50.521 --> 49:51.221
No, no, no, no.

49:51.222 --> 49:52.790
What are you doing?

49:55.493 --> 49:58.163
Everybody calm down.

50:00.665 --> 50:03.434
God damn it, I guess there's
no covering that up, is there?

50:05.170 --> 50:06.537
And don't.

50:07.805 --> 50:10.841
- You're-- you're the--
- Yeah, yeah, you got me.

50:11.042 --> 50:12.009
I'm the Mangler guy.

50:12.443 --> 50:13.644
I was gonna kill
you all quietly.

50:14.312 --> 50:16.181
Don't worry, I'll
figure something out.

50:17.148 --> 50:18.182
Fuck.

50:18.183 --> 50:19.884
You know what? Why don't
you grab the booth?

50:21.186 --> 50:22.353
Why don't you
go fuck yourself?

50:23.354 --> 50:24.722
Get in the booth pretty please.

50:25.356 --> 50:26.191
With cherries on top.

50:30.461 --> 50:33.164
All right, well, there's
one less to deal with, yeah.

50:37.235 --> 50:38.869
I'm warning you.

50:41.239 --> 50:42.340
Yeah, got it.

50:43.908 --> 50:45.410
What are we gonna do?

50:47.312 --> 50:48.346
What are we gonna do?

50:50.215 --> 50:52.217
I mean, I could
just shoot y'all.

50:53.251 --> 50:54.485
Like, shoot y'all.

50:54.819 --> 50:57.088
1,2,3,4...
Well, where's the fun in that?

50:57.655 --> 50:58.823
So what else are we gonna do?

50:59.390 --> 51:00.925
Fuck!

51:03.094 --> 51:05.096
Well, definitely no skull
fucking. You know what I mean?

51:05.363 --> 51:06.497
Hey, hey, hey, hey, look, I'm--

51:10.335 --> 51:10.935
Wait a minute.

51:12.337 --> 51:12.870
Shit.

51:18.109 --> 51:20.745
I mean, I'm here
for a reason, right?

51:21.512 --> 51:23.381
I mean, so just hear me out.

51:23.881 --> 51:28.886
If you are the Almighty or the,
you know, like a-- whatever.

51:29.086 --> 51:30.388
Okay.

51:30.588 --> 51:33.924
And you put a shark in a tank
full of guppies,

51:34.125 --> 51:35.793
what do you think
is gonna happen?

51:36.261 --> 51:37.695
Shark's gonna eat, right?

51:37.962 --> 51:39.364
That's--

51:42.267 --> 51:45.736
I mean, how many times do you
think it's been--

51:48.105 --> 51:48.939
Hey.

51:51.276 --> 51:52.377
Watch this.

52:02.287 --> 52:02.887
Seriously?

52:03.154 --> 52:04.289
Come on, dude.

52:33.651 --> 52:36.821
I'm a fucking god!

52:56.307 --> 52:57.442
Shit!

54:03.274 --> 54:05.676
Hey, you want to
hold this for me?

54:05.876 --> 54:06.911
What?

54:07.545 --> 54:09.079
Do you want to
hold this for me?

54:09.747 --> 54:10.681
Oh, no. Fuck no.

54:10.881 --> 54:11.516
Yeah, I'll pass, man.

54:11.716 --> 54:12.216
Okay.

54:12.417 --> 54:13.083
Wait, hey.

54:13.518 --> 54:14.184
Whoa.

54:14.385 --> 54:15.252
Serious.

54:15.586 --> 54:16.887
Dude, what the fuck is that?

54:18.188 --> 54:19.089
Ah too late

54:19.557 --> 54:20.691
Dude, what the fuck, you sicko?

54:20.891 --> 54:21.759
What the fuck are you doing?

54:21.959 --> 54:22.960
Whoa, what the shit?

54:23.528 --> 54:24.895
Dude, what the fuck, you sicko?

54:28.866 --> 54:29.467
You good, man?

54:29.700 --> 54:30.199
You--

54:30.200 --> 54:31.101
Call somebody.

54:33.904 --> 54:35.105
You okay?

54:35.906 --> 54:37.808
I'm on top of the
fuck with the world.

54:38.809 --> 54:41.211
My friends, they
know where I am, okay?

54:42.980 --> 54:44.482
You didn't flush.

54:46.817 --> 54:49.219
I don't fucking flush,
no one fucking flushes

54:51.155 --> 54:52.423
You didn't flush!

54:52.623 --> 54:53.458
I normally don't!

54:53.658 --> 54:55.493
It's fucking disgusting.

54:56.827 --> 54:58.295
You gotta be honest.

55:29.326 --> 55:31.996
Hey can you turn that up?

55:42.473 --> 55:44.375
Are you okay?

55:51.649 --> 55:53.384
Hey can you turn that up?

56:04.061 --> 56:05.630
You can grab a seat anywhere

56:05.830 --> 56:06.830
Hey can you turn that up?

56:06.831 --> 56:08.065
- Just sit anywhere.
- Just sit anywhere.

56:08.298 --> 56:09.166
Just sit anywhere.

56:10.535 --> 56:11.669
Hey can you turn that up?

56:13.804 --> 56:14.304
Order Up

56:41.999 --> 56:43.033
Hey can you turn that up?

56:43.233 --> 56:44.168
You can grab a seat anywhere

56:44.401 --> 56:45.936
I'd like a foot rub

56:47.538 --> 56:49.574
Shut the fuck up, Gary.

56:54.879 --> 56:57.281
Would you like to
see a menu?

56:58.215 --> 56:59.717
What are you doing?

57:00.217 --> 57:01.018
Okay, I'm gonna--

57:01.218 --> 57:03.353
Give me some coffee.

57:05.089 --> 57:06.123
Okay.

57:07.458 --> 57:09.760
I am so fucking tired of this.

57:10.561 --> 57:12.697
Back and forth
between you and me.

57:14.765 --> 57:16.734
What are you talking about?

57:19.804 --> 57:21.706
Have you ever been intimate
with someone?

57:23.307 --> 57:25.476
Like you had the perfect moment.

57:26.276 --> 57:29.614
And then the next day you're
just a fucking stranger.

57:32.282 --> 57:33.718
Forget it.

57:36.220 --> 57:37.488
Forget it!

57:38.088 --> 57:40.290
Just-- I'm so fucking
tired of this.

57:41.325 --> 57:42.727
What are you--

57:43.728 --> 57:44.895
I'm gonna go get you a menu.

57:45.095 --> 57:46.463
No, I don't want a menu.

57:48.265 --> 57:52.002
I want eggs and bacon.

57:53.638 --> 57:54.805
Sorry.

57:55.072 --> 57:56.674
Yeah, you cut out
breakfast at noon.

57:56.907 --> 57:57.775
I know.

57:58.809 --> 58:00.511
But you had eggs back then.

58:00.978 --> 58:02.279
All right.

58:02.513 --> 58:04.148
You had them back there. They're
in the fridge.

58:04.982 --> 58:06.917
Was that big fucking
cook hiding them?

58:07.251 --> 58:08.085
Hmm?

58:15.660 --> 58:16.493
Eggs.

58:17.828 --> 58:18.328
Fucking--

58:18.663 --> 58:19.096
Knew it.

58:19.964 --> 58:20.531
Sir.

58:21.799 --> 58:22.566
Jesus Christ.

58:22.567 --> 58:24.001
You're supposed to be here.

58:24.368 --> 58:27.672
Yeah, yeah. Just make me
some fucking eggs.

58:28.773 --> 58:30.140
Sir, you're very rude.

58:30.775 --> 58:35.546
I suggest you find seat before
you find trouble.

58:36.647 --> 58:37.882
I'm getting real
tired of your shit.

58:38.683 --> 58:39.617
You hear me?

58:39.817 --> 58:40.885
All your little sneaking around?

58:41.151 --> 58:42.820
Huh? Like some
little fucking bug?

58:43.287 --> 58:44.989
I'm fucking God here!

58:46.957 --> 58:50.294
Well, Mr. High Mighty, I'll
help you find a seat.

58:51.962 --> 58:53.530
But you get no fucking eggs.

59:04.875 --> 59:08.579
You come my kitchen, tell
me how fry cook.

59:10.848 --> 59:11.682
That was a good one.

59:13.417 --> 59:15.753
Okay, but let's do this.

59:17.321 --> 59:18.188
Let's uh--

59:19.890 --> 59:21.358
Let's set the ground rules.

59:21.726 --> 59:24.328
No rules of ground. You get
fucked from here, huh?

59:24.528 --> 59:26.030
You're gonna want to hear
what I have to say.

59:28.265 --> 59:29.333
So you show me gun.

59:32.837 --> 59:33.503
Yeah.

59:33.871 --> 59:35.405
I mean, you know.

59:36.240 --> 59:37.742
Because okay, because
I'm saying no guns.

59:38.008 --> 59:38.909
No guns.

59:39.443 --> 59:41.746
Blades are allowed. Blades okay.

59:42.246 --> 59:43.412
Nowhere critical.

59:43.413 --> 59:45.415
And when I beat you, you make
me a fucking omelet.

59:45.750 --> 59:47.217
And whatever's in there, because
that smells delicious.

59:47.417 --> 59:48.218
Understand?

59:48.919 --> 59:49.386
Da?

59:49.720 --> 59:50.486
Da.

59:50.487 --> 59:52.857
But no fucking eggs for you.

01:00:07.204 --> 01:00:08.205
I've hit him in the nuts.

01:00:08.773 --> 01:00:09.640
I played coy.

01:00:09.874 --> 01:00:10.774
I tried to sneak up on him.

01:00:10.775 --> 01:00:12.376
He's got this sixth
sense, this KGB,

01:00:12.743 --> 01:00:14.010
super secret agent
thing going on.

01:00:14.011 --> 01:00:17.748
All right, I just gotta-- I
gotta keep my head straight.

01:00:17.948 --> 01:00:18.816
I gotta keep my head focused.

01:00:19.216 --> 01:00:20.117
You know what I mean?

01:00:21.151 --> 01:00:22.219
All right? I can't even sleep.

01:00:22.619 --> 01:00:23.553
I don't even know
what's going on.

01:00:28.325 --> 01:00:28.793
Yes.

01:00:30.060 --> 01:00:30.627
Yes!

01:00:32.429 --> 01:00:33.063
Here it goes.

01:00:39.904 --> 01:00:40.771
What are you here for?

01:00:42.272 --> 01:00:43.340
This is not for you.

01:00:45.275 --> 01:00:47.344
But I really just
want some eggs.

01:00:48.312 --> 01:00:49.947
And I thought maybe
if I asked nice.

01:00:50.180 --> 01:00:53.350
You know, no served
breakfast after 12.

01:00:53.583 --> 01:00:54.718
I know.

01:00:54.719 --> 01:00:59.957
But I thought maybe you could
cut me some slack.

01:01:00.825 --> 01:01:01.591
No breakfast.

01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:04.028
No slack would be cut.

01:01:17.942 --> 01:01:18.675
All right.

01:01:21.611 --> 01:01:22.612
Let's get on with it.

01:01:27.484 --> 01:01:28.385
Walk.

01:01:29.019 --> 01:01:30.687
Push. Plate. Boom. Cup.

01:01:43.300 --> 01:01:44.969
No. Fuck.

01:01:57.081 --> 01:01:58.582
Punch, punch. Knee.

01:01:59.249 --> 01:02:00.417
Punch, punch. Knee. Pit.

01:02:00.650 --> 01:02:01.051
Balls.

01:02:03.020 --> 01:02:03.420
Fuck.

01:02:19.669 --> 01:02:20.670
Then...

01:02:24.674 --> 01:02:25.675
Watch this.

01:02:31.281 --> 01:02:32.282
Fuck. Yes.

01:02:39.023 --> 01:02:40.024
Watch this.

01:02:54.371 --> 01:02:55.539
Fuckin' giver.

01:02:57.407 --> 01:02:58.642
Shut up!

01:05:08.838 --> 01:05:09.773
Hey.

01:05:12.076 --> 01:05:13.077
No, hey!

01:05:14.344 --> 01:05:14.978
Sir?

01:05:14.979 --> 01:05:16.446
Hey, you see that guy?

01:05:18.215 --> 01:05:19.216
Who?

01:05:24.721 --> 01:05:25.722
He was...

01:05:28.625 --> 01:05:31.228
Oh, I gotta get out of here.

01:05:31.861 --> 01:05:32.862
I'm losing my mind.

01:05:33.463 --> 01:05:34.531
I'm losing my mind.

01:05:34.731 --> 01:05:35.865
Yeah, maybe you
should go home.

01:05:37.934 --> 01:05:38.969
I can't.

01:05:41.138 --> 01:05:42.372
Don't you get it, I...

01:05:43.974 --> 01:05:47.577
I don't even know
where home is anymore.

01:05:49.113 --> 01:05:50.614
Would you like
me to call someone?

01:05:55.419 --> 01:05:56.486
Who?

01:05:58.388 --> 01:05:59.990
Who the fuck are
you gonna call, huh?

01:06:02.126 --> 01:06:03.093
I'll figure it out.

01:06:03.293 --> 01:06:04.794
Go, get the fuck outta here.

01:06:07.897 --> 01:06:08.898
You know what?

01:06:09.166 --> 01:06:10.167
Look, coffee.

01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:11.901
Thank you.

01:06:32.122 --> 01:06:33.423
Sir, you can't sleep here.

01:06:34.324 --> 01:06:35.459
Sir, I'm sorry.

01:06:36.293 --> 01:06:36.993
No, no.

01:06:38.295 --> 01:06:39.496
Are you okay?

01:06:42.599 --> 01:06:43.500
I don't know, no.

01:06:55.345 --> 01:06:58.048
Hey, can I get some
fucking coffee?

01:07:01.451 --> 01:07:02.852
How we doing this evening?

01:07:05.955 --> 01:07:07.324
You know...

01:07:08.725 --> 01:07:10.394
Why don't you and I have
a little talk outside.

01:07:13.497 --> 01:07:14.731
No, I can't.

01:07:16.466 --> 01:07:18.034
I really need you to come
outside with me.

01:07:18.235 --> 01:07:20.537
I don't think you understand.

01:07:21.971 --> 01:07:22.806
No, you don't understand.

01:07:24.208 --> 01:07:25.209
You can do this your way.

01:07:26.843 --> 01:07:28.212
Or you can do this the easy way.

01:07:34.584 --> 01:07:36.086
Fucking overtime, my ass.

01:07:38.422 --> 01:07:40.224
Wouldn't happen to be your
truck out back, would it?

01:07:43.593 --> 01:07:44.361
No!

01:07:44.561 --> 01:07:47.231
I can't go outside!

01:07:48.565 --> 01:07:49.899
Don't, don't!

01:07:52.869 --> 01:07:57.407
Don't fucking do it.

01:07:59.443 --> 01:08:00.444
Hey, could you turn that up?

01:08:00.877 --> 01:08:01.711
Hi, can I help you?

01:08:03.847 --> 01:08:04.848
Dropped by fork.

01:08:05.115 --> 01:08:06.583
Excuse me.

01:08:09.719 --> 01:08:11.020
Hey, Marcus, could you help me

01:08:11.221 --> 01:08:12.389
with the napkins
in the stock room?

01:08:12.922 --> 01:08:13.890
Can't find the stool.

01:08:14.090 --> 01:08:15.259
Hey, could you turn that up?

01:08:15.859 --> 01:08:17.026
Oh, you can grab
a seat anywhere.

01:08:21.765 --> 01:08:22.766
You're awesome.

01:08:27.137 --> 01:08:28.104
Hey, could you turn that up?

01:08:29.573 --> 01:08:30.574
Hi, can I help you?

01:08:35.044 --> 01:08:36.045
Dropped my fork.

01:08:36.246 --> 01:08:37.214
Excuse me.

01:08:39.816 --> 01:08:40.683
Hey, could you turn that up?

01:08:40.684 --> 01:08:42.051
Oh, you can grab
a seat anywhere.

01:08:42.619 --> 01:08:43.720
Hey, Marcus, could you help me

01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:45.155
with the napkins
in the stock room?

01:08:47.056 --> 01:08:48.124
You're awesome.

01:08:49.993 --> 01:08:50.894
Oh, I dropped my fork.

01:08:52.262 --> 01:08:53.129
Excuse me.

01:08:53.330 --> 01:08:54.231
Are you okay?

01:08:56.966 --> 01:08:57.967
Can I get you something?

01:09:00.804 --> 01:09:01.805
I don't know.

01:09:03.407 --> 01:09:04.174
I don't know.

01:09:06.443 --> 01:09:07.444
What?

01:09:11.281 --> 01:09:12.081
Huh?

01:09:13.350 --> 01:09:14.418
You don't know what.

01:09:23.493 --> 01:09:24.294
Uh-uh.

01:09:24.494 --> 01:09:25.695
Uh-uh.

01:09:27.297 --> 01:09:29.098
You really disappoint
me, you know that?

01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:34.204
I thought he was a real one,
but just look at you.

01:09:35.505 --> 01:09:37.140
You look like
you're about to cry.

01:09:40.210 --> 01:09:41.945
You gonna cry for me?

01:09:47.517 --> 01:09:53.623
Charlie Sobhraj, Ted Bundy,
Domer, Ed Gein.

01:09:54.458 --> 01:09:55.559
Them's real ones.

01:09:56.360 --> 01:09:57.894
What would they do
if they were here

01:09:58.228 --> 01:10:00.497
in your shoes right now?

01:10:03.333 --> 01:10:04.834
What would your daddy do?

01:10:08.972 --> 01:10:10.374
Don't you talk about my daddy.

01:10:11.174 --> 01:10:11.841
No?

01:10:12.676 --> 01:10:14.009
Why's that?

01:10:14.010 --> 01:10:15.379
Because he's got nothing to
do with what's going on here.

01:10:15.645 --> 01:10:17.414
So shut the fuck
up about my dad.

01:10:19.383 --> 01:10:20.650
Alright.

01:10:23.753 --> 01:10:24.988
What are you up to now anyways?

01:10:30.026 --> 01:10:30.760
12.

01:10:30.994 --> 01:10:31.395
12?

01:10:31.595 --> 01:10:32.729
Yeah.

01:10:33.563 --> 01:10:37.401
Yeah, I've killed
her like 20 times.

01:10:39.369 --> 01:10:40.737
Yet, there she is.

01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:46.910
So what the fuck
am I supposed to do?

01:10:47.377 --> 01:10:48.278
I don't know.

01:10:48.512 --> 01:10:49.846
That's for you to figure out.

01:10:50.380 --> 01:10:52.949
But what I do know is, you
running around here

01:10:53.182 --> 01:10:55.419
with your dick hanging out,
ain't getting nothing done.

01:10:56.686 --> 01:10:58.855
Yeah - "I am fucking God."

01:10:59.289 --> 01:11:00.590
What is that shit?

01:11:00.790 --> 01:11:01.725
You like an idiot.

01:11:02.058 --> 01:11:02.959
I am -

01:11:03.192 --> 01:11:04.761
Am a worthless piece of shit.

01:11:08.765 --> 01:11:09.765
What are you gonna do?

01:11:09.766 --> 01:11:12.035
You gonna go back to your
booth and pout?

01:11:12.936 --> 01:11:14.538
You gonna let them break you?

01:11:16.806 --> 01:11:17.974
I gotta get out of here.

01:11:18.207 --> 01:11:19.108
"I gotta get out of here."

01:11:19.309 --> 01:11:22.579
I have killed all of them.

01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:24.748
Everyone.

01:11:25.114 --> 01:11:26.450
Yet, there they are.

01:11:44.968 --> 01:11:49.339
So I, uh - what are
you saying? I gotta -

01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:52.342
You think? If I -

01:11:53.910 --> 01:11:54.510
I -

01:11:54.511 --> 01:11:55.579
Have you tried it?

01:11:58.482 --> 01:11:59.449
Expelled them all clean.

01:12:01.017 --> 01:12:02.018
Not a peep.

01:12:03.820 --> 01:12:04.821
Yeah.

01:12:34.150 --> 01:12:35.719
Don't forget to flush.

01:12:38.622 --> 01:12:40.690
Hey, Marcos, can
you help me with the napkins

01:12:40.890 --> 01:12:41.524
in the stockroom?

01:12:41.525 --> 01:12:42.659
I can't find my sool.

01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:44.227
Okay.

01:12:44.561 --> 01:12:45.562
You're awesome.

01:12:46.796 --> 01:12:47.797
Asshole.

01:12:48.532 --> 01:12:50.667
Oops, I dropped my fork.

01:12:51.401 --> 01:12:52.569
Oh, I'll get it
for you, darling.

01:12:53.236 --> 01:12:54.337
Excuse me.

01:12:55.539 --> 01:12:57.874
You know what,
they're right there.

01:12:58.842 --> 01:12:59.809
I'll be right back.

01:13:17.561 --> 01:13:18.661
Ma'am?

01:13:18.662 --> 01:13:20.530
Excuse me, I think there is
a man over there.

01:13:20.730 --> 01:13:22.031
He's having some serious issues.

01:13:59.736 --> 01:14:01.437
Fucking occupied, man.

01:14:01.638 --> 01:14:02.472
What the shit?

01:14:37.674 --> 01:14:39.308
What the fuck?

01:14:39.509 --> 01:14:40.644
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:14:45.849 --> 01:14:47.617
Shh, shh.

01:14:53.022 --> 01:14:54.023
Hello, darling.

01:15:01.130 --> 01:15:01.865
Easy.

01:15:10.106 --> 01:15:12.175
Please, what do
you want from me?

01:15:20.016 --> 01:15:21.317
Sorry, I'm late, hon.

01:15:21.685 --> 01:15:23.319
Jakey's daddy called
me out of the blue.

01:15:23.519 --> 01:15:25.021
He said he did a
lift and I told him,

01:15:25.221 --> 01:15:27.891
I have to go to work, but
he said it was an emergency

01:15:28.224 --> 01:15:31.127
and you know me, I'm a pleaser,
so I pick him up

01:15:31.327 --> 01:15:32.896
and are you okay?

01:15:34.397 --> 01:15:35.464
Why are you holding the gun?

01:15:44.708 --> 01:15:47.143
Now it's just you and me.

01:15:53.149 --> 01:15:55.151
Here we are, again.

01:15:56.252 --> 01:15:58.554
This is the way it
was meant to be.

01:16:01.257 --> 01:16:02.258
Fuck the others.

01:16:04.493 --> 01:16:05.762
Fuck them, no, hey.

01:16:07.230 --> 01:16:08.231
You're special.

01:16:10.867 --> 01:16:14.070
But I can't keep doing this.

01:16:15.739 --> 01:16:17.406
I'm losing my fucking mind.

01:16:18.942 --> 01:16:23.279
My fucking head, doing the same
thing over and over again

01:16:23.512 --> 01:16:26.515
and again and again and I can't
sleep and I can't die.

01:16:27.250 --> 01:16:32.521
But I figured it out.

01:16:33.589 --> 01:16:34.557
I did it.

01:16:36.525 --> 01:16:44.133
And you, you, you're my last.

01:16:45.802 --> 01:16:48.237
Please, I have a daughter.

01:16:54.610 --> 01:16:55.879
Hey, can you turn that up?

01:16:58.147 --> 01:16:59.749
This isn't your
living room, you know.

01:17:00.483 --> 01:17:02.318
Oh, well if it were, you'd
jave a beer in your hand

01:17:02.551 --> 01:17:04.119
you'd be about ready to give
me a foot rub.

01:17:04.120 --> 01:17:05.655
Oh yeah, what about Gary?

01:17:06.322 --> 01:17:07.423
Gary don't like foot rubs.

01:17:07.757 --> 01:17:09.158
Hey, I'd like a foot rub.

01:17:09.392 --> 01:17:10.426
Shut the fuck up, Gary.

01:17:17.300 --> 01:17:18.101
Hey.

01:18:01.144 --> 01:18:02.378
Just gonna fucking sit here.

01:19:18.287 --> 01:19:19.288
You real?

01:19:22.025 --> 01:19:23.960
Of course, my son.

01:19:25.895 --> 01:19:27.063
Please.

01:19:47.116 --> 01:19:48.117
Why are you here?

01:19:48.551 --> 01:19:49.552
Why is anyone here?

01:19:57.393 --> 01:19:58.394
Not it.

01:19:59.929 --> 01:20:00.897
Y- ou look tired.

01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:07.070
I can't sleep.

01:20:10.173 --> 01:20:12.175
What have you learned?

01:20:14.510 --> 01:20:15.678
Learned?

01:20:19.148 --> 01:20:21.584
I, uh,

01:20:24.687 --> 01:20:26.522
I wanna go home.

01:20:26.755 --> 01:20:27.857
But you're not ready.

01:20:29.192 --> 01:20:29.624
No.

01:20:29.625 --> 01:20:31.027
I'm ready.

01:20:32.862 --> 01:20:34.163
I'm very ready.

01:20:36.332 --> 01:20:38.267
Why are you here?

01:20:41.871 --> 01:20:43.139
I don't know.

01:20:44.040 --> 01:20:45.541
Yes, you do.

01:20:45.774 --> 01:20:46.274
No.

01:20:46.275 --> 01:20:47.443
Yes, you do.

01:20:56.619 --> 01:20:57.620
Salvation?

01:20:58.654 --> 01:20:59.822
Have you found it?

01:21:02.892 --> 01:21:03.726
No.

01:21:04.493 --> 01:21:05.494
Have you tried?

01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:13.002
I don't-

01:21:18.908 --> 01:21:21.643
I don't think that, uh-

01:21:21.644 --> 01:21:22.645
What?

01:21:28.584 --> 01:21:32.055
I've done a lot of bad things.

01:21:38.261 --> 01:21:40.163
Though your sins
are like scarlet,

01:21:41.730 --> 01:21:43.666
they shall be cleansed
white as snow.

01:21:44.333 --> 01:21:47.903
Isaiah 1:18, but you know that
already, don't you?

01:21:50.073 --> 01:21:52.575
The first step is to ask.

01:22:01.684 --> 01:22:05.754
I wanna see the trees.

01:22:07.390 --> 01:22:09.092
And I wanna see them
sway in the wind,

01:22:09.458 --> 01:22:14.630
and I'm gonna hear the birds,
and watch the sunset.

01:22:16.532 --> 01:22:20.236
I haven't cared about these
things before.

01:22:20.436 --> 01:22:21.570
I don't know.

01:22:21.770 --> 01:22:25.574
That, that was before,
right? Except...

01:22:25.975 --> 01:22:28.277
Except when?

01:22:29.245 --> 01:22:29.979
Don't.

01:22:31.814 --> 01:22:33.248
You have to say it.

01:22:33.249 --> 01:22:33.816
No.

01:22:34.150 --> 01:22:34.883
Charlie.

01:22:35.284 --> 01:22:35.883
No.

01:22:35.884 --> 01:22:36.419
Charlie.

01:22:36.619 --> 01:22:37.953
No.

01:22:40.223 --> 01:22:42.992
You have the whole world
at your fingertips.

01:22:44.627 --> 01:22:49.265
You have the power to choose
your own destiny.

01:22:49.465 --> 01:22:50.098
This isn't real.

01:22:50.099 --> 01:22:51.434
What will you choose?

01:22:51.634 --> 01:22:53.236
This isn't real.

01:22:53.436 --> 01:22:56.572
If I were to take this knife
and drive it into your hand,

01:22:56.805 --> 01:22:58.007
is it real?

01:22:58.607 --> 01:23:01.744
Because it is, it's
as real as it gets.

01:23:03.112 --> 01:23:04.513
Now, tell me.

01:23:11.854 --> 01:23:13.156
Tell me.

01:23:20.863 --> 01:23:22.165
I wanna be free.

01:23:27.636 --> 01:23:30.606
I want forgiveness.

01:23:34.310 --> 01:23:35.311
There you go.

01:23:36.179 --> 01:23:37.146
There you go.

01:23:44.687 --> 01:23:45.721
How does it feel?

01:24:00.636 --> 01:24:01.637
Feels good.

01:24:01.837 --> 01:24:02.505
Hey.

01:24:02.705 --> 01:24:03.672
Feels good.

01:24:05.474 --> 01:24:06.475
That's right.

01:24:08.977 --> 01:24:11.314
But what do I do?

01:24:12.881 --> 01:24:13.882
I don't know what to do.

01:24:15.418 --> 01:24:16.419
Start over.

01:24:51.787 --> 01:24:53.021
Hey, can you turn that up?

01:24:53.889 --> 01:24:55.591
This isn't your
living room, you know.

01:24:55.924 --> 01:24:57.926
Well, if it were, you'd have
beer in your hand,

01:24:58.127 --> 01:24:59.228
you'd be about ready to give
me a foot rub.

01:24:59.528 --> 01:25:00.863
Oh yeah, what about Gary?

01:25:01.764 --> 01:25:03.198
I'll give you
a foot rub, Gary.

01:25:03.199 --> 01:25:04.800
We have a developing
story in the Southeast Heights.

01:25:05.401 --> 01:25:06.902
Uh, can we not do that?

01:25:07.270 --> 01:25:08.271
I mean, do we have
to listen to that?

01:25:08.771 --> 01:25:10.004
I wanna see it.

01:25:10.005 --> 01:25:12.275
He's a bad guy doing bad
things and he hurts people.

01:25:13.976 --> 01:25:15.043
Why don't we just
enjoy our dinner?

01:25:15.944 --> 01:25:16.945
I'm with you.

01:25:22.785 --> 01:25:23.786
Order up.

01:25:49.745 --> 01:25:52.181
You think he'd really
give me a foot rub?

01:25:53.416 --> 01:25:54.517
What are you doing?

01:25:54.750 --> 01:25:55.851
Just-

01:25:56.084 --> 01:25:57.486
Oh my God!

01:25:57.686 --> 01:25:58.987
I was gonna go
back by my house.

01:25:59.188 --> 01:26:00.289
I thought she was
gonna lie there.

01:26:00.489 --> 01:26:01.657
I'm gonna watch TV, babe.

01:26:01.857 --> 01:26:02.525
Yo!

01:26:04.026 --> 01:26:04.827
How's it going?

01:26:05.661 --> 01:26:06.962
Who the fuck are you?

01:26:08.597 --> 01:26:12.368
What no, "hi", just, who
the fuck are you?

01:26:12.701 --> 01:26:14.002
Are you fucking serious?

01:26:15.170 --> 01:26:16.339
Do we know you?

01:26:16.605 --> 01:26:17.640
Yeah, I don't know
what you're trying

01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:19.107
to sell us here, pal, but.

01:26:19.508 --> 01:26:21.477
Nope, not pals.

01:26:26.349 --> 01:26:27.450
Why are you with
these two clowns?

01:26:28.116 --> 01:26:29.318
Yo, fuck you!

01:26:30.619 --> 01:26:31.787
There you go again.

01:26:34.022 --> 01:26:34.723
See?

01:26:37.826 --> 01:26:39.295
Just listen.

01:26:41.063 --> 01:26:44.400
This is where I normally blow
your fucking brains out.

01:26:47.503 --> 01:26:50.138
However, I've had
a change of heart.

01:26:50.839 --> 01:26:52.708
We don't want any
trouble, so if--

01:26:53.509 --> 01:26:54.310
You do.

01:26:55.511 --> 01:26:56.879
But not this trouble.

01:26:57.212 --> 01:26:59.081
So, why don't you two get the
fuck out of here?

01:26:59.715 --> 01:27:01.149
Diner's closed, so.

01:27:04.019 --> 01:27:04.386
Don't fuck!

01:27:04.387 --> 01:27:04.920
Hey!

01:27:08.924 --> 01:27:09.825
I know.

01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:13.061
You okay?

01:27:14.363 --> 01:27:19.335
Do you need a ride, cause I
could arrange one for you.

01:27:24.507 --> 01:27:27.042
I'm good, thanks though.

01:27:28.277 --> 01:27:29.211
Okay.

01:27:51.634 --> 01:27:53.068
Can I help you, doll?

01:27:54.937 --> 01:27:55.704
Pie.

01:27:55.904 --> 01:27:57.205
I want pie.

01:27:58.073 --> 01:27:59.308
Okay, just any pie?

01:27:59.542 --> 01:28:00.275
All of it.

01:28:00.643 --> 01:28:01.910
We have a lot of pie.

01:28:02.478 --> 01:28:03.546
What's your favorite?

01:28:03.746 --> 01:28:05.948
Um, strawberry rhubarb.

01:28:06.915 --> 01:28:07.950
Oh, shoot. You're fancy.

01:28:08.484 --> 01:28:09.485
No, I'm not fancy.

01:28:09.918 --> 01:28:10.819
It's okay.

01:28:11.286 --> 01:28:12.287
You deserve it.

01:28:13.322 --> 01:28:13.922
Okay.

01:28:14.122 --> 01:28:14.723
Um...

01:28:15.724 --> 01:28:16.424
Yeah.

01:28:16.425 --> 01:28:17.893
Could I get it heated up?

01:28:18.461 --> 01:28:19.662
Of course.

01:28:20.929 --> 01:28:23.566
You want an ice cream on
the side, cowboy?

01:28:23.999 --> 01:28:26.301
Uh, yes, please.

01:28:26.502 --> 01:28:27.403
Okay.

01:28:30.473 --> 01:28:31.674
It's the pudding.

01:28:32.007 --> 01:28:33.809
It's the pudding. It makes
it like watery.

01:28:34.009 --> 01:28:35.644
It's like a laxative. And I'm
like, they're old.

01:28:35.844 --> 01:28:37.011
Excuse me?

01:28:37.012 --> 01:28:39.181
I know. Another annoying guy
hitting on you, right?

01:28:39.648 --> 01:28:43.752
But I just saw you got off your
shift and nurses, right?

01:28:44.487 --> 01:28:46.922
I just wanted to say thank
you for your service,

01:28:47.255 --> 01:28:51.360
of all the jobs out
there, and you two pick one
where you help people.

01:28:51.960 --> 01:28:55.631
It takes a special
kind of person to do that,
night after night.

01:28:56.465 --> 01:28:57.264
Thanks.

01:28:57.265 --> 01:28:58.633
Thank you.

01:28:58.634 --> 01:28:59.802
Yeah, that's all.

01:29:00.669 --> 01:29:02.971
Have a great night
and the pie's on me.

01:29:03.672 --> 01:29:04.806
Oh, you don't have to do
that.

01:29:04.807 --> 01:29:05.541
Already done.

01:29:07.376 --> 01:29:10.512
Hey, what's your name?

01:29:10.513 --> 01:29:11.480
That
doesn't matter.

01:29:12.948 --> 01:29:14.716
Have a great night. Me too.

01:29:14.717 --> 01:29:15.551
You too.

01:29:17.386 --> 01:29:18.386
Free pie. I'll take it.

01:29:18.387 --> 01:29:20.222
What you do is you
take the raw noodles

01:29:20.489 --> 01:29:23.191
and you, like, throw them in.
You try and catch his...

01:29:23.826 --> 01:29:25.893
Would you mind if I...?

01:29:25.894 --> 01:29:26.628
Yeah, we do.

01:29:26.629 --> 01:29:27.629
We're trying to have a nice-

01:29:27.630 --> 01:29:28.497
Have a nice night?

01:29:29.164 --> 01:29:30.298
I know. Me too.

01:29:31.133 --> 01:29:32.167
I get it. I...

01:29:32.535 --> 01:29:34.737
Look, just gonna be a second.

01:29:36.004 --> 01:29:39.408
But I don't even
know where to start.

01:29:39.642 --> 01:29:42.711
My mom. My mom, she...

01:29:45.814 --> 01:29:48.551
My dad was a real
son of a bitch.

01:29:50.052 --> 01:29:53.756
He did a lot of bad
things, and he put hands to my
mom on the regular.

01:29:54.723 --> 01:29:56.825
And they tried to hide that from
us, but kids know.

01:29:58.093 --> 01:30:00.529
And then, of course, he would
cheat on her all the time.

01:30:01.430 --> 01:30:03.098
He didn't even try to hide that.

01:30:03.866 --> 01:30:06.001
And my mom would
take it out on us.

01:30:07.870 --> 01:30:09.336
Vicous cycle.

01:30:09.337 --> 01:30:12.941
Look, I don't know what
you have going on in
your respective homes.

01:30:14.610 --> 01:30:21.216
But.. Kids know. Everyone knows.
And think of them.

01:30:21.850 --> 01:30:24.419
Mr., I don't know what you
think is going on here...

01:30:24.620 --> 01:30:25.621
But don't be an asshole.

01:30:27.956 --> 01:30:28.957
Take it or leave it.

01:30:37.900 --> 01:30:38.733
Another one?

01:30:38.734 --> 01:30:39.802
What? No.

01:30:40.035 --> 01:30:41.470
No.

01:30:41.970 --> 01:30:43.706
I thought you were
gonna have them all.

01:30:44.773 --> 01:30:45.541
I tried.

01:30:46.642 --> 01:30:48.611
But, uh...

01:30:51.480 --> 01:30:52.648
You know what? Three more.

01:30:54.650 --> 01:30:57.953
He said...

01:30:58.320 --> 01:31:01.924
He said... "bananas..."

01:31:05.794 --> 01:31:08.931
Because he was a monkey.

01:31:09.632 --> 01:31:12.000
How long does it take for
him to tell stories?

01:31:12.234 --> 01:31:15.070
A long time. Hanging
out with him is kind of
like doing charity work.

01:31:17.072 --> 01:31:18.340
Hey there, cowboy.

01:31:21.076 --> 01:31:24.346
You, uh... got one
of those for me?

01:31:29.852 --> 01:31:30.786
Sure.

01:31:35.824 --> 01:31:37.626
Here. Gotcha.

01:31:45.433 --> 01:31:46.802
The stars are out tonight.

01:31:48.971 --> 01:31:51.373
Look at them. It's like a fog
of stars up there.

01:31:52.440 --> 01:31:54.376
It's the Milky Way.

01:31:55.210 --> 01:31:55.978
Wow.

01:31:56.845 --> 01:31:57.613
Wait.

01:31:59.682 --> 01:32:00.983
We're in the Milky Way.

01:32:02.851 --> 01:32:05.554
Yeah, silly. We're part of it.

01:32:06.454 --> 01:32:09.625
Okay, but... if I
can see it up there...

01:32:11.359 --> 01:32:12.060
How's it...

01:32:13.662 --> 01:32:14.830
Down here?

01:32:17.700 --> 01:32:19.534
You'd have to ask
my daughter, Amy.

01:32:20.703 --> 01:32:21.970
She's the astronaut.

01:32:23.138 --> 01:32:24.039
How old is she?

01:32:24.707 --> 01:32:26.374
Ten. But she loves her stars.

01:32:26.575 --> 01:32:28.977
I mean, she could show you where
every constellation is.

01:32:29.745 --> 01:32:32.047
I think I'd like that.

01:32:37.252 --> 01:32:38.186
Uh...

01:32:39.521 --> 01:32:41.223
Can I walk you to your car?

01:32:42.424 --> 01:32:43.358
Sure.

01:32:56.004 --> 01:32:57.105
Well, um...

01:32:58.106 --> 01:32:59.608
Be safe. There's...

01:33:00.442 --> 01:33:01.877
Lots of bad guys out there.

01:33:04.947 --> 01:33:06.782
Is this your pickup?

01:33:07.582 --> 01:33:09.417
Uh, yeah. I like the...

01:33:10.853 --> 01:33:11.887
old stuff.

01:33:22.364 --> 01:33:23.265
Well...

01:33:24.432 --> 01:33:26.234
the night is still young.

01:33:53.328 --> 01:33:54.329
Come on.

01:33:57.232 --> 01:33:58.233
Uh...

01:33:59.968 --> 01:34:00.969
That one's broken.

01:34:02.570 --> 01:34:03.471
Sorry.

01:34:03.672 --> 01:34:04.940
Of course.

01:34:40.108 --> 01:34:41.309
What are you doing?

01:34:41.944 --> 01:34:43.812
I don't know.

01:34:44.179 --> 01:34:45.047
Um...

01:34:48.150 --> 01:34:49.351
I never...

01:34:51.720 --> 01:34:52.654
Come here.

01:35:00.062 --> 01:35:01.163
Why?

01:35:01.864 --> 01:35:03.999
What do you
mean, "why," silly?

01:35:06.134 --> 01:35:07.002
Why tonight?

01:35:08.703 --> 01:35:09.972
Don't you feel this...

01:35:11.573 --> 01:35:13.041
connection between us, or...?

01:35:15.243 --> 01:35:16.578
Come here.

01:36:13.802 --> 01:36:15.070
Well, that's it, isn't it?

01:36:17.439 --> 01:36:19.041
I thought we were almost there.

01:36:19.641 --> 01:36:21.243
We were getting closer.

01:36:22.244 --> 01:36:23.078
How is she?

01:36:23.278 --> 01:36:24.112
She's fine.

01:36:25.713 --> 01:36:26.614
You need a moment?

01:36:26.815 --> 01:36:27.749
No, no. I'm...

01:36:27.950 --> 01:36:28.817
I'm okay.

01:36:29.051 --> 01:36:30.351
You sure?

01:36:30.352 --> 01:36:32.287
Mm-hmm. Just, like, a little
bit of a headache. I'm good.

01:36:33.421 --> 01:36:34.823
You can let the board go.

01:36:46.568 --> 01:36:48.070
Good morning, sunshine.

01:36:50.638 --> 01:36:51.573
Just relax.

01:36:52.440 --> 01:36:53.241
Relax.

01:36:53.441 --> 01:36:55.143
Hey! Where am I?

01:36:55.343 --> 01:36:57.112
It'll take you a moment to get
your bearings back.

01:36:59.414 --> 01:37:00.482
How do you feel?

01:37:02.951 --> 01:37:05.020
You're not a priest.

01:37:06.454 --> 01:37:07.655
No, I'm Dr. Lovato.

01:37:07.990 --> 01:37:09.858
Residence psychiatrist
here at Nuroscape.

01:37:10.092 --> 01:37:11.359
This is Dr. Stevens.

01:37:11.659 --> 01:37:13.127
Do you remember me, Charlie?

01:37:13.128 --> 01:37:13.996
Kind of.

01:37:14.196 --> 01:37:15.097
That's good.

01:37:15.297 --> 01:37:16.531
Do you remember signing up?

01:37:20.635 --> 01:37:21.669
How'd I do?

01:37:24.439 --> 01:37:26.942
We just let the
parole board go.

01:37:30.045 --> 01:37:31.213
How do you feel?

01:37:33.681 --> 01:37:34.950
My head hurts.

01:37:36.451 --> 01:37:38.720
Amy, can you get him
something for his head?

01:37:40.155 --> 01:37:41.122
Wow!

01:37:41.123 --> 01:37:43.158
No, no, no, wait a
minute. That's her.

01:37:43.625 --> 01:37:44.459
Calm down.

01:37:44.659 --> 01:37:45.827
No. Don't. Fuck you!

01:37:46.028 --> 01:37:47.061
Don't tell me to calm down.

01:37:47.062 --> 01:37:47.462
Charlie you don't
know what's going on.

01:37:48.163 --> 01:37:48.463
Look, look. That's her.

01:37:48.964 --> 01:37:49.197
It's not her.

01:37:50.098 --> 01:37:50.465
Turn the fuck
around! That's her!

01:37:51.166 --> 01:37:51.466
Listen, no, no, no, no.

01:37:53.035 --> 01:37:54.236
Our patients will
sometimes project people they
see into the simulation.

01:37:54.469 --> 01:37:55.137
It's not her.

01:37:55.403 --> 01:37:56.204
That's her.

01:37:56.638 --> 01:37:57.639
It's her.

01:37:58.340 --> 01:37:59.707
Just think about it, Charlie.

01:38:00.475 --> 01:38:02.410
You saw her when we
were prepping you.

01:38:03.011 --> 01:38:03.645
No.

01:38:04.479 --> 01:38:05.213
No, that's...

01:38:05.480 --> 01:38:07.814
You fucking cunt whore.

01:38:07.815 --> 01:38:08.550
You set me up.

01:38:08.750 --> 01:38:09.985
You made the choice.

01:38:11.920 --> 01:38:13.921
No. That's not true. You-

01:38:13.922 --> 01:38:14.990
You interfered.

01:38:16.591 --> 01:38:19.161
You threw yourself onto me!

01:38:19.427 --> 01:38:21.163
You just couldn't help
yourself, could you?

01:38:21.363 --> 01:38:22.529
That's enough.

01:38:22.530 --> 01:38:23.664
What do you think is going to
happen if you do...

01:38:23.665 --> 01:38:25.600
You said you...
was she in control?

01:38:25.934 --> 01:38:27.335
No, it's mostly you.

01:38:27.602 --> 01:38:28.703
It's all from your head.

01:38:29.071 --> 01:38:30.272
We just interjected here.

01:38:30.505 --> 01:38:32.106
No.

01:38:32.107 --> 01:38:34.776
You said that this was
therapy and that I would have
a chance to commute.

01:38:35.443 --> 01:38:36.844
To walk.

01:38:37.079 --> 01:38:37.945
No.

01:38:37.946 --> 01:38:38.980
And then you
threw her in here.

01:38:38.981 --> 01:38:40.515
I said you might
avoid the chair.

01:38:41.049 --> 01:38:42.284
I never said you'd walk.

01:38:46.421 --> 01:38:48.090
You set me up!

01:38:48.790 --> 01:38:50.225
You fucking bitch!

01:38:51.126 --> 01:38:52.961
You fucking cunt whore!

01:38:53.428 --> 01:38:54.529
You did good.

01:38:54.729 --> 01:38:56.098
Thank you for
letting me do it.

01:38:56.631 --> 01:38:57.732
She did good, right?

01:38:57.932 --> 01:38:59.267
I think she did too good.

01:38:59.534 --> 01:39:01.136
How do you like
working at the asylum?

01:39:01.569 --> 01:39:02.437
I like it.

01:39:02.937 --> 01:39:04.239
Who do we have next?

01:39:07.075 --> 01:39:08.376
David Zajanski.

01:39:08.810 --> 01:39:10.112
Jesus Christ.

01:39:23.158 --> 01:39:25.393
As we move these patients
through the simulations,

01:39:25.727 --> 01:39:29.131
they are forced to confront the
humanity of their actions.

01:39:30.232 --> 01:39:32.400
They are broken down and rebuilt

01:39:32.600 --> 01:39:35.437
into compassionate, fully
functional human beings,

01:39:35.637 --> 01:39:37.739
full of empathy and kindness.

01:39:38.440 --> 01:39:41.009
Someone whom you'd be happy
to have as a neighbor,

01:39:41.743 --> 01:39:44.012
a schoolteacher, a friend.

01:39:44.412 --> 01:39:45.313
Dr. Stevens.

01:39:46.414 --> 01:39:47.849
Hi, Ron Weissman.

01:39:48.183 --> 01:39:50.318
I wanted to get you on record
for a story I'm doing.

01:39:51.153 --> 01:39:52.854
At Neuroscape Therapeutics,

01:39:53.155 --> 01:39:55.290
we are not only
tackling psychopathy

01:39:55.523 --> 01:39:57.425
and pioneering criminal
justice reform,

01:39:57.992 --> 01:40:00.794
but also addressing broader
societal issues.

01:40:00.795 --> 01:40:05.466
So there are some
critics that are voicing
concerns about your program.

01:40:05.467 --> 01:40:07.068
Are there?

01:40:07.069 --> 01:40:10.538
Letting these types
of people just relive their
most notorious crimes

01:40:10.772 --> 01:40:13.941
over and over again, don't you
think that's a little weird

01:40:14.142 --> 01:40:15.343
for the families
and their victims?

01:40:16.144 --> 01:40:18.646
Our
thought recalibration
programs

01:40:18.846 --> 01:40:21.549
can correct harmful
wrong-think patterns

01:40:21.783 --> 01:40:25.220
and foster a more empathetic and
enlightened community.

01:40:25.620 --> 01:40:26.721
Look, this isn't real.

01:40:27.455 --> 01:40:29.356
It's in their
heads, simulations,

01:40:29.357 --> 01:40:31.659
same as if they were fantasizing
in their prison cell.

01:40:31.859 --> 01:40:33.495
Yes, but from the
victims' perspective...

01:40:33.695 --> 01:40:34.362
Look, Roy?

01:40:34.829 --> 01:40:36.730
Ron.

01:40:36.731 --> 01:40:38.866
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,

01:40:39.067 --> 01:40:40.234
we need a medic!

01:40:40.235 --> 01:40:43.238
The best thing we can do to
honor these victims

01:40:43.471 --> 01:40:45.673
is to find a way to
end this affliction.

01:40:47.242 --> 01:40:48.509
You said you got close.

01:40:48.510 --> 01:40:51.646
Have you been able to get any of
their sentences commuted?

01:40:52.180 --> 01:40:54.082
Our results have
been very promising.

01:40:54.316 --> 01:40:57.819
This is more than a solution
for psychopathy.

01:40:58.086 --> 01:41:01.089
This is a promise
for a better future

01:41:01.323 --> 01:41:03.391
and a better society.

01:41:03.758 --> 01:41:05.326
One last question.

01:41:05.327 --> 01:41:08.730
The critics say that
this is nothing but cruel and
unusual punishment.

01:41:08.930 --> 01:41:10.064
Are there any side effects?

01:41:10.265 --> 01:41:12.667
Who are these
critics, by the way?

01:41:14.569 --> 01:41:16.371
All of our patients
are volunteers,

01:41:16.571 --> 01:41:18.940
and no, we haven't observed
any side effects.

01:41:19.607 --> 01:41:20.542
Excuse me.

01:41:20.875 --> 01:41:22.076
Do you have credentials?

01:41:22.677 --> 01:41:23.611
Of course.

01:41:24.412 --> 01:41:25.680
I lift them in my car.

01:41:26.281 --> 01:41:27.382
You should get them.

01:41:27.949 --> 01:41:29.917
Thank you for
being here today.

01:41:31.119 --> 01:41:35.123
And together, let's walk forward
into this new world.

01:41:40.295 --> 01:41:41.463
He hasn't slept.

01:41:42.697 --> 01:41:44.266
He hasn't slept in days.

01:41:44.932 --> 01:41:46.568
It's okay.

01:41:46.768 --> 01:41:48.603
I have nothing for him.

01:41:48.803 --> 01:41:50.738
No, no, no!

01:41:51.139 --> 01:41:52.374
I can't sleep!

01:41:52.574 --> 01:41:54.576
I can't sleep!

01:41:58.380 --> 01:42:01.415
The Killer Cafe has a way.

01:42:01.416 --> 01:42:04.586
Where just desserts
served every day.

01:42:08.556 --> 01:42:11.159
