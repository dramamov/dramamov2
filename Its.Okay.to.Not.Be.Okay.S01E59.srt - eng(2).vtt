WEBVTT

00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:04.170
Olivia, you don't have
the right to do this to Samuel!

00:00:04.254 --> 00:00:05.422
You're just a nurse!

00:00:05.505 --> 00:00:07.382
I am not just a nurse!

00:00:07.465 --> 00:00:11.302
I'm the only one who truly
cares about him so just leave!

00:00:11.386 --> 00:00:12.512
You can let Olivia go.

00:00:12.595 --> 00:00:13.888
What if she's your mom?

00:00:13.972 --> 00:00:15.890
Don't you think it's
odd that of all people,

00:00:15.974 --> 00:00:17.559
she wants to have Sir Samuel with her?

00:00:17.642 --> 00:00:19.853
Why is she so interested in your dad?

00:00:19.936 --> 00:00:23.106
When I say my mother is dead, she's dead.

00:00:23.481 --> 00:00:25.024
Time of death: 9:12.

00:00:25.108 --> 00:00:27.986
- Samuel died because of you.
- No!

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:31.740
Is Mia sad?
Is that what sadness looks like?

00:00:31.823 --> 00:00:35.744
This is just so heartbreaking
because Mia really is an orphan now.

00:01:39.641 --> 00:01:41.309
I didn't…

00:01:41.392 --> 00:01:45.814
{\an8}M-Matmat didn't draw that.

00:01:46.856 --> 00:01:49.734
{\an8}M-Matmat wouldn't draw that.

00:01:49.818 --> 00:01:53.113
{\an8}The butterflies are following Matmat!

00:01:53.196 --> 00:01:57.033
{\an8}The butterflies
are following Matmat!

00:01:57.117 --> 00:02:00.703
{\an8}The butterflies who killed Mama
are after Matmat!

00:02:00.787 --> 00:02:05.291
{\an8}The woman was wearing that!

00:02:05.375 --> 00:02:08.795
{\an8}- Matmat doesn't want that!
Matmat, breathe. Breathe.

00:02:08.878 --> 00:02:11.506
{\an8}I don't want that!

00:02:12.006 --> 00:02:13.716
{\an8}S-She'll kill us, Patpat!

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.301
{\an8}No, no. I'm here.

00:02:15.385 --> 00:02:19.848
{\an8}
She will! I hate it! I hate it!

00:02:19.931 --> 00:02:22.600
{\an8}We'll face the butterfly together,
remember Matmat?

00:02:22.684 --> 00:02:26.187
{\an8}

00:02:27.397 --> 00:02:29.107
{\an8}That butterfly…

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:34.571
{\an8}killed your mother?

00:02:34.654 --> 00:02:36.489
{\an8}

00:02:38.658 --> 00:02:40.952
{\an8}I hate it, Patpat!

00:02:43.037 --> 00:02:45.748
{\an8}-
Matmat, breathe.

00:02:45.832 --> 00:02:47.208
{\an8}We'll face the butterfly.

00:02:47.292 --> 00:02:49.752
{\an8}I don't want to be here, Patpat!

00:02:49.836 --> 00:02:51.421
{\an8}Mia!

00:02:51.504 --> 00:02:53.256
{\an8}Doc, Aunt Li.

00:02:53.715 --> 00:02:56.551
{\an8}D-Don't leave me!

00:02:58.261 --> 00:03:02.390
{\an8}Dr. Anok, that's what
Matmat was telling you about!

00:03:02.932 --> 00:03:06.311
{\an8}No one can hurt you here. We're here.
No one will hurt you.

00:03:06.853 --> 00:03:08.104
{\an8}

00:03:08.771 --> 00:03:10.064
{\an8}Mia!

00:03:10.148 --> 00:03:11.107
{\an8}Mia…

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.234
{\an8}

00:03:13.318 --> 00:03:15.778
{\an8}I know that butterfly.

00:03:16.654 --> 00:03:18.448
{\an8}Because it's one of a kind.

00:03:23.077 --> 00:03:25.204
The person who designed that…

00:03:28.791 --> 00:03:30.209
is my mother.

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:46.017
We're the only ones
who knew about that design.

00:03:50.605 --> 00:03:52.732
And now Matmat is saying…

00:03:54.275 --> 00:03:56.569
that the woman who killed
your mother was wearing it?

00:04:00.615 --> 00:04:02.033
Yes, Mia but--

00:04:03.368 --> 00:04:05.161
And now it's on the mural.

00:04:06.454 --> 00:04:08.748
What could that mean, Patrick?

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:14.587
Patpat!

00:04:14.671 --> 00:04:17.674
Don't leave me, Patpat!

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.051
Go back to Matmat.

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:22.595
He's more important.

00:04:23.721 --> 00:04:25.056
Leave me alone!

00:04:26.641 --> 00:04:28.309
I need time to think.

00:04:31.104 --> 00:04:32.730
Don't follow me.

00:04:34.565 --> 00:04:36.317
I can handle myself.

00:05:01.551 --> 00:05:03.261
He's there! There.

00:05:03.344 --> 00:05:04.721
There, he's there.

00:05:16.816 --> 00:05:17.817
Matmat?

00:05:19.861 --> 00:05:23.114
Are the butterflies still there?

00:05:23.197 --> 00:05:25.116
M-Matmat saw

00:05:25.533 --> 00:05:29.162
Matmat saw two butterflies.

00:05:30.371 --> 00:05:32.790
A b-baby butterfly,

00:05:33.624 --> 00:05:35.793
and a mama butterfly.

00:05:38.254 --> 00:05:39.547
Yes, Matmat.

00:05:43.468 --> 00:05:46.137
But you don't dream
about it anymore, right?

00:05:48.306 --> 00:05:49.515
You know…

00:05:51.184 --> 00:05:52.351
I think…

00:05:55.396 --> 00:05:57.315
I think it's just playing tricks.

00:06:00.109 --> 00:06:02.278
It's tricking Matmat?

00:06:03.154 --> 00:06:04.489
They're mean,

00:06:05.239 --> 00:06:08.034
They're mean and they're tricking Matmat.

00:06:10.161 --> 00:06:11.788
Yes.

00:06:15.333 --> 00:06:17.794
They're jealous
because your work is beautiful.

00:06:20.713 --> 00:06:22.131
They're jealous

00:06:22.215 --> 00:06:25.426
because Matmat's painting is beautiful?

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:26.886
So they ruined it?

00:06:28.554 --> 00:06:29.931
Yes.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.227
Matmat, remember you said.

00:06:37.563 --> 00:06:39.482
When the butterfly comes…

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.861
we'll face it together?

00:06:48.699 --> 00:06:50.618
We'll be brave.

00:06:52.328 --> 00:06:53.329
Right?

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:00.628
Matmat has to be brave.

00:07:01.212 --> 00:07:02.797
That's right, Matmat.

00:07:03.381 --> 00:07:06.592
Because I'm big now.

00:07:06.676 --> 00:07:07.969
So I should,

00:07:08.052 --> 00:07:11.681
Matmat should be brave.

00:07:11.764 --> 00:07:13.099
Yes.

00:07:16.018 --> 00:07:17.395
Shall we come out?

00:07:26.154 --> 00:07:27.155
There.

00:07:30.616 --> 00:07:33.077
- Matmat.
- Mama Li…

00:07:35.121 --> 00:07:37.498
I'll go cook Cansi.

00:07:37.582 --> 00:07:39.917
Gemma's there, do you want to come?

00:07:41.627 --> 00:07:45.298
Matmat wants Cansi but…

00:07:46.674 --> 00:07:50.470
we still have to face the butterfly.

00:07:52.388 --> 00:07:55.558
Patrick said it's just
someone playing tricks.

00:07:55.641 --> 00:07:59.061
And people who play
tricks shouldn't be paid attention.

00:08:00.771 --> 00:08:03.316
Don't pay attention.

00:08:03.399 --> 00:08:06.819
- Matmat won't pay attention.
- Yes.

00:08:07.653 --> 00:08:09.614
Is that okay, Patpat?

00:08:10.781 --> 00:08:11.908
Mmm.

00:08:11.991 --> 00:08:13.075
Yes, Matmat.

00:08:14.952 --> 00:08:17.413
Go on, I'll take care of Matmat.

00:08:17.497 --> 00:08:19.916
I know Mia needs you. Go ahead.

00:08:19.999 --> 00:08:24.253
Come on. We'll change your clothes,
you're drenched in sweat.

00:08:24.337 --> 00:08:25.213
You might get sick.

00:08:25.296 --> 00:08:28.049
Look at your back, it's soaked.

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:51.072
I know it's somewhere here!

00:08:54.825 --> 00:08:56.661
It has to be somewhere here!

00:09:05.253 --> 00:09:07.880
I don't want you to come back…

00:09:08.798 --> 00:09:11.634
I don't want you to come back.

00:09:13.719 --> 00:09:18.558
You're going to take away
all the beautiful things I have now.

00:09:37.994 --> 00:09:39.829
What are you going to draw, Matmat?

00:09:41.122 --> 00:09:43.708
It's hard for me to draw, Gemma.

00:09:44.792 --> 00:09:47.920
Matmat can't draw the butterfly yet.

00:09:52.925 --> 00:09:53.926
Matmat.

00:09:54.468 --> 00:09:55.595
Just take it slow.

00:09:55.678 --> 00:09:57.847
If you can't do it today,
try again tomorrow.

00:09:58.889 --> 00:10:02.184
If Matmat can't
finish the butterfly today,

00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:04.437
he'll try again tomorrow.

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:06.522
I'll start with the face today.

00:10:06.606 --> 00:10:08.274
Ah! You're drawing the face!

00:10:08.357 --> 00:10:10.860
I know that! Let's practice it.

00:10:10.943 --> 00:10:13.237
Come on. Which emotion
would you like today?

00:10:13.321 --> 00:10:16.115
Would you like a-- No, I have an idea.

00:10:16.198 --> 00:10:18.075
- How about shocked?
- He's gone through

00:10:18.159 --> 00:10:20.661
a lot of difficult times,

00:10:20.745 --> 00:10:23.372
but he keeps giving his best.

00:10:24.123 --> 00:10:26.167
I have so much respect for that kid.

00:10:26.876 --> 00:10:28.127
You're right, Mama Li.

00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:30.046
Others would just give up right away.

00:10:31.464 --> 00:10:33.257
He and Patrick.

00:10:33.924 --> 00:10:37.720
They manage to face
anything that comes their way.

00:10:41.599 --> 00:10:43.059
Mia.

00:10:45.144 --> 00:10:46.896
Did she kill your mother?

00:10:49.565 --> 00:10:51.567
Ingrid Hernandez.

00:10:54.612 --> 00:10:56.697
Was she your mother's killer?

00:11:02.119 --> 00:11:04.955
The butterfly that's
been haunting Matmat…

00:11:09.043 --> 00:11:10.461
Is it my mother's?

00:11:14.173 --> 00:11:16.300
- Mia…
- And you knew.

00:11:17.051 --> 00:11:19.428
You've known for a long time.

00:11:20.388 --> 00:11:21.806
Mia, I haven't known long.

00:11:22.807 --> 00:11:24.225
How long, Patrick?

00:11:25.810 --> 00:11:27.686
How long have you known?

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:31.190
Only recently.

00:11:31.273 --> 00:11:33.651
When Matmat helped Mister Tommy,

00:11:34.735 --> 00:11:37.613
he was able to tell me and Doc Anok

00:11:37.696 --> 00:11:39.490
what happened the night our mother died.

00:11:44.412 --> 00:11:45.913
So she's alive?

00:11:52.753 --> 00:11:55.965
That's why you've
been so protective of me.

00:11:57.383 --> 00:11:59.718
Now it's all making sense to me.

00:12:03.681 --> 00:12:09.270
Is that why you keep
insisting I face Nurse Olivia?!

00:12:11.772 --> 00:12:16.152
Did she paint
that butterfly on Matmat's mural?!

00:12:19.405 --> 00:12:20.739
I don't know.

00:12:22.366 --> 00:12:24.452
- We're not sure--
- So, she's alive?!

00:12:24.535 --> 00:12:27.288
Just tell me! Is she alive?!

00:12:28.873 --> 00:12:30.583
I don't know, Mia.

00:12:30.666 --> 00:12:32.877
I want to say no,
but with what's going on,

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:34.462
I just don't know.

00:12:34.545 --> 00:12:37.423
No, this can't be happening.

00:12:37.506 --> 00:12:40.593
I don't
want her back in my life.

00:12:40.676 --> 00:12:42.261
Mia.

00:12:44.263 --> 00:12:46.098
You two, leave!

00:12:46.182 --> 00:12:48.309
- Mia, we're not going anywhere!
- Go away!

00:12:48.392 --> 00:12:49.602
If your mother is really alive,

00:12:49.685 --> 00:12:51.604
that's all the more
reason for us to stay.

00:12:52.438 --> 00:12:54.190
You listen to me.

00:12:55.107 --> 00:12:57.318
All of us will just end up getting hurt.

00:12:58.194 --> 00:12:59.278
Why?

00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:02.198
You think you're like your mother?

00:13:03.491 --> 00:13:05.618
Mia, we're not
leaving each other, remember?

00:13:06.952 --> 00:13:09.038
I can't keep that promise anymore.

00:13:10.289 --> 00:13:11.749
Just leave!

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:30.059
M-Mama Li cooked all of this.

00:13:30.142 --> 00:13:33.354
She said you two should eat well.

00:13:34.063 --> 00:13:36.273
Have you eaten, Patpat?

00:13:38.192 --> 00:13:39.485
Not yet.

00:13:40.611 --> 00:13:43.656
How about M-Mia?

00:13:48.953 --> 00:13:50.454
Not yet, Matmat.

00:13:50.538 --> 00:13:53.666
She's not feeling well,
so she hasn't come out yet.

00:13:54.875 --> 00:13:57.795
Mia's sick?

00:13:57.878 --> 00:14:00.839
She needs to take some medicine, Patpat.

00:14:00.923 --> 00:14:04.593
But b-before she takes some medicine,

00:14:04.677 --> 00:14:06.971
she needs to eat something so that

00:14:07.388 --> 00:14:08.597
so that she can be strong.

00:14:13.852 --> 00:14:15.938
She still won't come
out of her room, Matmat.

00:14:16.021 --> 00:14:20.818
Matmat will take Mia some food.

00:14:20.901 --> 00:14:22.862
Mia will listen to me because…

00:14:24.071 --> 00:14:25.614
I'm the eldest.

00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:30.953
Patpat, heat this up for me.

00:14:34.582 --> 00:14:36.375
Oh, Doc, I need you to sign this.

00:14:36.458 --> 00:14:37.543
Okay.

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:40.671
- Nurse.
- Ma'am Eden's not here yet?

00:14:40.754 --> 00:14:42.006
Yeah, she's not here yet.

00:14:42.548 --> 00:14:44.800
She hasn't come in to work for days.

00:14:44.884 --> 00:14:46.051
Nurse.

00:14:46.135 --> 00:14:48.721
- Have you contacted her?
- Yes, Doc, but…

00:14:48.804 --> 00:14:50.514
We can't reach her by phone.

00:14:50.598 --> 00:14:54.101
We've already
informed Doc Anok but,

00:14:54.518 --> 00:14:57.187
doesn't it seem strange?

00:14:57.271 --> 00:14:58.772
I know, right?

00:14:58.856 --> 00:15:01.442
I've been here for a while,
and she never calls in sick.

00:15:01.525 --> 00:15:05.279
And she always tells us if she has
to leave, even if it's just for a while.

00:15:05.946 --> 00:15:09.033
But now, it's been days
and still no word from her.

00:15:10.576 --> 00:15:11.869
Where is she?

00:15:15.873 --> 00:15:18.292
Mia?

00:15:20.169 --> 00:15:21.879
It's Matmat.

00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:41.315
You need to eat.

00:15:43.609 --> 00:15:48.989
You need t-to eat
what Matmat brought you.

00:15:55.454 --> 00:16:01.251
You need to eat so you can feel better.

00:16:01.835 --> 00:16:05.923
Just have a small bite.
Just a small bite.

00:16:06.006 --> 00:16:08.550
That's what Patpat said.

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:13.389
Thank you, Matmat.

00:16:13.472 --> 00:16:15.140
But I'm not hungry.

00:16:18.435 --> 00:16:21.105
Do you not like Matmat?

00:16:21.188 --> 00:16:24.274
Do you not like your big brother?

00:16:27.486 --> 00:16:32.408
You told me you wanted
me to me your big brother, but…

00:16:33.158 --> 00:16:36.036
you're not listening to me.

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:40.040
That means you don't like Matmat anymore.

00:16:51.552 --> 00:16:53.095
You're still my big brother.

00:16:55.389 --> 00:16:57.725
Okay.

00:16:57.808 --> 00:17:01.353
T-Time to eat. Time to eat.

00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:09.111
Mama Li made this.

00:17:15.784 --> 00:17:19.079
M-Mia is crying?

00:17:20.456 --> 00:17:25.961
Are you going
through something very painful?

00:17:32.176 --> 00:17:33.761
Matmat…

00:17:36.847 --> 00:17:39.683
I'm so, so sorry.

00:17:50.069 --> 00:17:52.196
You have to look people in the eye

00:17:52.279 --> 00:17:56.617
to show them your apology was sincere.

00:17:57.618 --> 00:18:00.079
Look at Matmat.

00:18:08.587 --> 00:18:09.797
Matmat…

00:18:13.509 --> 00:18:17.513
I'm so, so… I'm so sorry.

00:18:20.182 --> 00:18:21.517
Shh, shh.

00:18:22.768 --> 00:18:24.186
I-It's okay.

00:18:24.269 --> 00:18:25.562
It's okay.

00:18:25.646 --> 00:18:30.150
I accept your apology.

00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:35.280
H-Hey, stop crying.

00:18:35.364 --> 00:18:38.117
Shush now. Stop crying.

00:18:38.742 --> 00:18:40.327
You should eat now.

00:18:40.410 --> 00:18:41.912
Eat now.

00:18:44.081 --> 00:18:48.293
D-Do you want to hear some good news?

00:18:48.377 --> 00:18:50.420
Matmat has some good news for you.

00:19:00.055 --> 00:19:01.140
Look.

00:19:02.141 --> 00:19:06.353
That's what Patrick looked like

00:19:06.436 --> 00:19:09.982
when he said he likes you.

00:19:12.442 --> 00:19:15.946
That's the only time Matmat…

00:19:17.865 --> 00:19:19.783
saw Patpat with a happy face.

00:19:23.829 --> 00:19:25.914
It's so beautiful.

00:19:27.166 --> 00:19:30.669
It's the most
beautiful thing I've ever seen.

00:19:34.256 --> 00:19:35.883
Hmm.

00:19:35.966 --> 00:19:38.594
I did a very good job?

00:19:38.677 --> 00:19:41.471
Did Matmat do a good job?

00:19:42.848 --> 00:19:48.312
I'll finally get to
finish drawing Mister Box,

00:19:48.395 --> 00:19:49.813
Mask Boy,

00:19:49.897 --> 00:19:53.942
and the Princess Without Feelings.

00:19:54.026 --> 00:19:58.655
Mia and Matmat
will finally finish the book.

00:20:05.495 --> 00:20:06.788
You should eat.

00:20:08.081 --> 00:20:10.542
You should listen to Matmat.

00:20:13.503 --> 00:20:14.546
Mia?

00:20:15.005 --> 00:20:16.173
Mia?

00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:17.591
Mia!

00:20:18.717 --> 00:20:20.886
How are you? Matmat told me you're sick.

00:20:20.969 --> 00:20:22.054
Are you okay?

00:20:26.391 --> 00:20:27.434
What's this?

00:20:29.394 --> 00:20:30.687
What is this check for?

00:20:32.064 --> 00:20:34.149
For not fulfilling my contract.

00:20:35.067 --> 00:20:37.402
Matmat and I won't be finishing the book.

00:20:38.403 --> 00:20:39.404
What?!

00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:44.451
I won't finish the book, Vincent.

00:20:44.534 --> 00:20:46.245
Work on another project.

00:20:46.328 --> 00:20:48.872
You still have the
investment from Erika, right?

00:20:48.956 --> 00:20:50.332
Yes!

00:20:50.415 --> 00:20:52.626
But only because she loves your book!

00:20:54.044 --> 00:20:56.964
Is this just a delay,
or you really won't finish it?

00:20:58.215 --> 00:21:00.008
Mia, what's happening?

00:21:01.802 --> 00:21:03.679
Look for another writer, Vincent.

00:21:04.805 --> 00:21:06.014
I'm done.

00:21:06.682 --> 00:21:07.808
I'm sorry.

00:21:10.727 --> 00:21:11.895
Mia--

00:21:14.147 --> 00:21:15.357
Hey, Patrick!

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:16.733
Boss, what are you doing here?

00:21:16.817 --> 00:21:18.694
I should ask you that.

00:21:18.777 --> 00:21:20.320
What happened to Mia?

00:21:21.238 --> 00:21:22.072
Huh?

00:21:22.155 --> 00:21:23.323
What happened?

00:21:23.407 --> 00:21:25.993
The other day,
I thought Mia was just sick.

00:21:26.076 --> 00:21:28.287
But now, she doesn't
want to finish their book.

00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:30.414
Vincent, I don't know
what you're talking about.

00:21:31.665 --> 00:21:35.252
Patrick, Mia doesn't want
to finish her book with Matmat.

00:21:35.335 --> 00:21:37.421
Why? What happened?

00:21:38.964 --> 00:21:41.091
All right, Vincent, I'll talk to her.

00:21:41.174 --> 00:21:42.342
Huh?

00:21:46.138 --> 00:21:48.098
Congrats, Matmat!

00:21:49.558 --> 00:21:51.351
Wow! Finally!

00:21:51.977 --> 00:21:54.771
Matmat can now

00:21:54.855 --> 00:21:56.815
draw faces.

00:21:56.898 --> 00:21:59.151
So all you needed was his face.

00:21:59.234 --> 00:22:00.694
Nice!

00:22:00.777 --> 00:22:02.362
Hey! What are you doing?

00:22:02.446 --> 00:22:03.822
Hey, hey, hey!

00:22:03.905 --> 00:22:07.242
Madeth, you might crease it.
Patpat's face might get creased.

00:22:07.326 --> 00:22:09.286
- Be careful with the paper.
- Oh, sorry.

00:22:09.369 --> 00:22:10.620
Sorry, Matmat.

00:22:10.704 --> 00:22:12.039
Sorry, Matmat.

00:22:12.122 --> 00:22:14.458
I'm just really happy, Matmat

00:22:14.541 --> 00:22:18.545
because you're
finally working with Miss Mia.

00:22:18.628 --> 00:22:21.173
I'll finally have some
money in my bank account.

00:22:22.758 --> 00:22:25.719
Mia can finally write the book.

00:22:25.802 --> 00:22:27.554
And I get to work with her!

00:22:27.637 --> 00:22:30.057
- Woo-hoo!
- You're amazing, Matmat!

00:22:54.956 --> 00:22:55.916
Mia?

00:22:56.458 --> 00:22:57.459
Mia!

00:22:58.085 --> 00:22:59.169
Mia!

00:22:59.252 --> 00:23:00.170
Mia!

00:23:00.253 --> 00:23:01.838
Mia, where are you going?

00:23:01.922 --> 00:23:03.548
Mia! Mia!

00:23:03.965 --> 00:23:05.092
Mia!

00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:08.261
Mia!

00:23:15.227 --> 00:23:16.186
Mia!

00:23:22.943 --> 00:23:23.944
Mia!

00:23:41.503 --> 00:23:45.882
Why are we going back home again?

00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:52.013
Is it because of the butterfly?

00:23:52.097 --> 00:23:53.265
But…

00:23:53.849 --> 00:23:57.978
we'll face the butterfly, right?

00:23:59.104 --> 00:24:00.230
Yes, Matmat.

00:24:01.148 --> 00:24:03.525
But for now, let's stay here, okay?

00:24:04.901 --> 00:24:06.570
Did you and Mia fight?

00:24:07.737 --> 00:24:09.322
Did you fight?

00:24:09.948 --> 00:24:14.119
You should kiss again so you can make up.

00:24:15.370 --> 00:24:17.831
We just have
something to talk about, Matmat.

00:24:17.914 --> 00:24:22.252
Y-you should kiss to make up.

00:24:22.335 --> 00:24:24.171
You must make up because…

00:24:25.255 --> 00:24:28.550
Mia and Matmat still have work to do.

00:24:28.633 --> 00:24:29.885
We still have work.

00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:33.096
Don't worry, Matmat.

00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:35.891
Mia and I will talk,
then you two will go back to work.

00:24:36.725 --> 00:24:42.230
Okay, talk first,
then kiss, then make up.

00:24:43.064 --> 00:24:44.065
Okay?

00:25:11.718 --> 00:25:12.719
Mia…

00:25:13.887 --> 00:25:15.472
wherever you go…

00:25:16.806 --> 00:25:18.642
Matmat and I will never leave you.

00:25:36.409 --> 00:25:39.371
I know you'll keep trying
to convince me to change my mind.

00:25:40.121 --> 00:25:41.081
One last time.

00:25:41.164 --> 00:25:42.666
I just want to protect you.

00:25:42.749 --> 00:25:46.628
We should not be torn apart
for a sin we didn't even commit.

00:25:46.711 --> 00:25:50.590
You think either Olivia or Eden
could be my mom?

00:25:50.674 --> 00:25:51.925
She is not here, Patrick.

00:25:52.008 --> 00:25:55.136
Ever since we found that
butterfly on Matmat's painting.

00:25:57.305 --> 00:25:58.682
Mia's in danger.
