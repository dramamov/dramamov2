00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.144
(Lee Joo Young)

00:00:17.718 --> 00:00:21.855
(Ji Seung Hyun)

00:00:27.728 --> 00:00:31.932
(Koo Jun Hoe)

00:00:41.542 --> 00:00:43.810
(Mom)

00:00:45.779 --> 00:00:50.050
(No Mercy)

00:00:52.052 --> 00:00:53.053
(All characters, organizations, groups,)

00:00:53.053 --> 00:00:54.054
(and events in this drama are fictitious.)

00:01:03.897 --> 00:01:07.568
(Mungyeong Station)

00:01:19.947 --> 00:01:20.848
So Min.

00:01:24.518 --> 00:01:25.385
Dad.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:27.621
Mom.

00:01:28.655 --> 00:01:30.490
Why do you look so startled?

00:01:31.225 --> 00:01:32.993
Let's go, our little princess.

00:01:33.961 --> 00:01:36.930
Come on, you still think
she's a little girl?

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.032
What? She still looks like
a little kid to me.

00:01:39.032 --> 00:01:42.536
Goodness, you're such a softie.

00:01:42.536 --> 00:01:43.470
Let's go, sweetheart.

00:01:52.145 --> 00:01:53.080
Where's Dad?

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.349
He probably went to get water.

00:01:59.419 --> 00:02:00.888
How's everything going these days?

00:02:02.456 --> 00:02:03.290
What do you mean?

00:02:05.292 --> 00:02:06.727
I mean, acting.

00:02:08.228 --> 00:02:09.329
How's that working out?

00:02:12.266 --> 00:02:15.469
I'm still building my experience.

00:02:17.738 --> 00:02:20.107
You're this age
and still gaining experience?

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.542
My goodness.

00:02:22.476 --> 00:02:25.579
If you were a police officer,
you'd be high-ranking by now.

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:27.014
Mom, please.

00:02:27.214 --> 00:02:31.118
At this rate, when will you
ever land a lead role?

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:34.621
I'm seriously losing my patience.

00:02:44.898 --> 00:02:46.300
Hey, look at you.

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.901
What are you laughing at?

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:50.470
I'm happy, that's all.

00:02:53.207 --> 00:02:55.442
You just asked me for the first time...

00:02:56.276 --> 00:02:57.611
about my work.

00:03:00.447 --> 00:03:01.515
You think that's funny?

00:03:02.249 --> 00:03:03.984
No, I'm not laughing at you.
I'm just happy.

00:03:05.052 --> 00:03:08.689
My goodness, you're so silly.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.896
(No Mercy)

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:22.369
Mr. Ma, are you on your way?
Where are you?

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:23.704
Yes, I'm on my way.

00:03:24.338 --> 00:03:26.573
I just passed Seongan Bridge.

00:03:26.573 --> 00:03:27.541
I see.

00:03:28.108 --> 00:03:29.376
Everything's okay, right?

00:03:31.245 --> 00:03:32.479
Sorry? What do you mean?

00:03:51.632 --> 00:03:53.467
(Ambulance)

00:03:57.037 --> 00:03:59.139
Seongnae Hospital's ER is full.

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:01.975
Call the nearest hospital.

00:04:02.643 --> 00:04:04.745
Traffic accident victim, male in his 40s,
needs CPR.

00:04:04.745 --> 00:04:06.980
The accident happened at 9.50 p.m.

00:04:15.255 --> 00:04:17.124
Emergency patient coming through.
Clear the way!

00:04:21.862 --> 00:04:22.896
What do you think you're doing?

00:05:05.706 --> 00:05:06.740
You scared me.

00:05:07.808 --> 00:05:09.109
Why are you looking at me like that?

00:05:10.544 --> 00:05:11.979
Good thing you're still alive.

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:14.081
Is So Min around?

00:05:14.081 --> 00:05:15.015
About that...

00:05:15.682 --> 00:05:16.617
we have a problem.

00:05:16.884 --> 00:05:17.651
What kind of problem?

00:05:18.452 --> 00:05:20.687
It's about those false rumors
going around about you.

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:24.491
You don't look that handsome
from this angle.

00:05:24.658 --> 00:05:26.493
Who called you a handsome detective?

00:05:27.528 --> 00:05:28.829
It's a mystery.

00:05:30.197 --> 00:05:31.732
Just tell me if So Min's here.

00:05:32.432 --> 00:05:33.233
If you want to know,
it'll cost you 50 cents.

00:05:33.233 --> 00:05:35.235
Enough of this from you. Understood?

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:37.437
Tell me where she is.

00:05:40.073 --> 00:05:40.874
Over there.

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.680
(Episode 6)

00:05:47.748 --> 00:05:48.916
What's so serious?

00:06:02.262 --> 00:06:03.697
Do you think he's dead?

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:07.367
We already checked.

00:06:08.468 --> 00:06:09.369
Does that worry you?

00:06:10.571 --> 00:06:11.705
It feels kind of empty.

00:06:12.339 --> 00:06:13.340
It's normal to feel that way.

00:06:14.575 --> 00:06:15.509
But...

00:06:16.476 --> 00:06:17.945
watch your back from here on out.

00:06:18.579 --> 00:06:20.247
They'll come after you.

00:06:21.014 --> 00:06:23.183
So, you should stay here for a while.

00:06:23.183 --> 00:06:24.151
I don't want to.

00:06:29.223 --> 00:06:30.924
It's over now.

00:06:30.924 --> 00:06:31.825
So Min.

00:06:32.259 --> 00:06:34.161
Your life could be in danger.

00:06:37.164 --> 00:06:38.232
I don't care about that.

00:06:40.033 --> 00:06:42.169
When I decided to kill Ma Seok Gu,

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:45.205
I put my life on the line too.

00:06:45.472 --> 00:06:46.440
You put your life on the line?

00:06:48.108 --> 00:06:50.377
You should realize how precious life is.

00:06:50.377 --> 00:06:53.814
Be grateful that both your parents
are alive.

00:06:53.814 --> 00:06:54.781
I don't care.

00:06:59.586 --> 00:07:00.921
What's the point of having parents alive?

00:07:02.189 --> 00:07:03.824
It's like they don't exist.

00:07:06.727 --> 00:07:09.730
My dad uses me for his reputation.

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:11.798
My mom went crazy
after being labeled a mistress.

00:07:13.333 --> 00:07:14.735
How's that normal?

00:07:17.204 --> 00:07:21.074
You think only the easy path
is worth taking, right?

00:07:21.875 --> 00:07:22.776
No.

00:07:23.911 --> 00:07:26.280
Even if it's not a glamorous path,
if it's easy for you to walk,

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:27.381
it's a good path.

00:07:28.949 --> 00:07:29.850
That's why...

00:07:30.651 --> 00:07:32.319
I want you to pick yourself up...

00:07:32.319 --> 00:07:34.354
and figure out the right path for you.

00:07:35.322 --> 00:07:37.591
I won't let you throw everything away.

00:07:42.529 --> 00:07:43.530
Fine.

00:07:44.598 --> 00:07:45.499
You mean it?

00:07:46.667 --> 00:07:49.203
- You promised.
- All right.

00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:53.207
Thanks for this. Bye.

00:08:01.048 --> 00:08:02.082
Thanks.

00:08:02.516 --> 00:08:03.350
For what?

00:08:04.284 --> 00:08:05.152
Just... thanks.

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:20.234
(For rent)

00:08:20.234 --> 00:08:23.303
(So Min Soup and Rice)

00:09:07.047 --> 00:09:08.048
What can I get you?

00:09:08.048 --> 00:09:10.284
Two regular sundae soups
and one special, please.

00:09:10.284 --> 00:09:11.285
You got it.

00:09:11.285 --> 00:09:13.520
Two regular, one special.
Get the stove going.

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:14.354
Okay.

00:09:14.354 --> 00:09:17.424
Goodness, the sides aren't ready.
What are you doing?

00:09:17.424 --> 00:09:18.292
It's burning.

00:09:18.292 --> 00:09:22.729
How long are you peeling that onion?
Forever?

00:09:22.729 --> 00:09:23.864
It's making my eyes burn and water.

00:09:23.864 --> 00:09:25.799
For crying out loud.

00:09:25.799 --> 00:09:27.167
Here you go.

00:09:30.804 --> 00:09:33.440
Dad, what should I do?
My eyes are burning.

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:34.575
Take your time.

00:09:40.214 --> 00:09:42.950
Okay, quick question.

00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:44.218
- Mr. Ha Hyun Jin?
- Yeah?

00:09:44.218 --> 00:09:46.420
Why did you marry Ms. Kim Mi Yang?

00:09:47.187 --> 00:09:48.522
Hmm.

00:09:49.456 --> 00:09:50.457
Because she's pretty.

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:54.928
Come on.

00:09:54.928 --> 00:09:55.762
Why?

00:09:57.431 --> 00:09:58.765
- So Min.
- Yeah?

00:09:59.533 --> 00:10:01.602
Do you know how much our soup costs?

00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:04.571
What? Eight dollars?

00:10:05.239 --> 00:10:06.440
Wrong.

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:08.976
Just one bowl? But there are two of you.

00:10:09.376 --> 00:10:12.279
I always bring my grandson here
for free food.

00:10:12.279 --> 00:10:13.580
I feel bad about it.

00:10:14.581 --> 00:10:17.417
It's normal to eat two bowls for two.

00:10:17.651 --> 00:10:20.120
Why do you always feel bad about it?

00:10:20.721 --> 00:10:21.922
Just a moment.

00:10:21.922 --> 00:10:23.257
I bet you're hungry, huh?

00:10:26.193 --> 00:10:27.594
Two bowls of soup.

00:10:31.098 --> 00:10:33.600
Why are you spacing out?

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:34.968
I told you to peel the onion.

00:10:34.968 --> 00:10:35.903
I am.

00:10:36.336 --> 00:10:38.338
You're the queen of spacing out.

00:10:38.338 --> 00:10:40.307
Here you go.

00:10:40.307 --> 00:10:41.275
Be careful.

00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:44.912
- So Min.
- Yes?

00:10:44.912 --> 00:10:47.447
You know that expression.

00:10:47.748 --> 00:10:50.083
Tough on the outside.

00:10:50.083 --> 00:10:52.452
What's it called?
Tough on the outside.

00:10:52.653 --> 00:10:53.754
Girl crush?

00:10:53.754 --> 00:10:54.922
No, that's not it.

00:10:54.922 --> 00:10:57.524
Tough outside, gentle inside.

00:10:58.559 --> 00:10:59.526
That's what I love about her.

00:11:00.093 --> 00:11:01.895
When you listen to your mom talk,

00:11:01.895 --> 00:11:04.765
it sounds harsh,
like she's rubbing salt in a wound.

00:11:05.365 --> 00:11:06.967
But if you listen closely,

00:11:06.967 --> 00:11:09.469
she's actually putting medicine on a cut.

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:11.738
That's the kind of person your mom is.

00:11:11.738 --> 00:11:14.908
Stop it. When did you
start bragging about your wife so much?

00:11:14.908 --> 00:11:16.610
All right.

00:11:20.848 --> 00:11:21.682
Here.

00:11:50.177 --> 00:11:51.478
(Water bill - Ha Hyun Jin)

00:12:19.239 --> 00:12:21.275
The commissioner will be here soon.

00:12:47.501 --> 00:12:50.504
(Commendation)
(Police Commissioner Park Jae Gyu)

00:12:56.877 --> 00:12:57.711
You made it.

00:13:04.151 --> 00:13:06.220
It seems you'd even be willing to...

00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:08.522
put yourself in danger for that girl.

00:13:10.057 --> 00:13:11.225
So I guess...

00:13:11.225 --> 00:13:13.594
you'd risk your life for this woman.

00:13:14.561 --> 00:13:17.264
Do you think I abandoned you and your mom?

00:13:17.698 --> 00:13:19.199
I can't say otherwise.

00:13:19.867 --> 00:13:22.870
I know how much you value your reputation.

00:13:25.038 --> 00:13:26.139
Jae Gyu?

00:13:26.139 --> 00:13:27.241
Back off!

00:13:27.241 --> 00:13:28.575
Please don't go.

00:13:28.575 --> 00:13:30.010
What about Jeong Hun?

00:13:30.477 --> 00:13:31.345
Damn it!

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:34.248
Jeong Hun.

00:13:37.217 --> 00:13:39.052
You may resent me now,

00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:42.623
but once you grow up
and experience the world,

00:13:43.524 --> 00:13:45.058
you'll understand why I did this.

00:13:47.127 --> 00:13:48.262
Please don't go.

00:13:48.262 --> 00:13:49.863
- Let go of me!
- Mom.

00:13:51.431 --> 00:13:52.299
Mom.

00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:05.445
(Police Commissioner Park Jae Gyu)

00:14:08.382 --> 00:14:10.751
Looks like you're not satisfied
with the position you got...

00:14:10.751 --> 00:14:12.119
by abandoning your first wife.

00:14:18.425 --> 00:14:19.826
You thought you could control me...

00:14:19.826 --> 00:14:22.596
by holding Ha So Min over my head.

00:14:22.596 --> 00:14:23.564
Not happening.

00:14:24.631 --> 00:14:27.501
I'll catch Ma Seok Gu
and lock him up myself.

00:14:28.769 --> 00:14:31.205
So just drop it, all right?

00:14:32.172 --> 00:14:35.042
I don't want to see
how low a man calling himself my dad...

00:14:35.042 --> 00:14:36.410
will stoop.

00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:41.014
Jeong Hun.

00:14:44.218 --> 00:14:47.187
What you see isn't the whole picture.

00:14:48.822 --> 00:14:50.457
My one mistake was...

00:14:51.258 --> 00:14:55.362
not exposing you to the real world sooner.

00:14:57.831 --> 00:15:00.801
If seeing that world is what it takes,

00:15:01.768 --> 00:15:03.170
then I'd rather stay blind.

00:15:15.249 --> 00:15:17.451
(Damage per victim)

00:15:17.451 --> 00:15:21.388
Why are you gathering statements
from the phishing victims?

00:15:22.055 --> 00:15:23.891
What are you up to?

00:15:25.225 --> 00:15:27.327
Jong Chan, stay out of it.

00:15:28.595 --> 00:15:29.763
You could get hurt.

00:15:30.464 --> 00:15:31.231
Detective Park.

00:15:32.132 --> 00:15:33.000
Yes, Chief.

00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:34.234
Come with me for a second.

00:15:39.239 --> 00:15:40.107
What's going on?

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:43.577
A man went missing
near Seongan Bridge last night.

00:15:44.111 --> 00:15:45.012
Missing?

00:15:45.012 --> 00:15:47.047
I think it's Ma Seok Gu.

00:15:47.414 --> 00:15:49.550
Ma Seok Gu?

00:15:49.917 --> 00:15:53.086
There was a major accident
in that area last night.

00:15:53.353 --> 00:15:55.956
The paramedics were ambushed
by gang members...

00:15:56.456 --> 00:15:58.759
and murdered.

00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:02.896
Every security camera in the area
was destroyed.

00:16:02.896 --> 00:16:05.265
They even took the dashcam footage.

00:16:05.265 --> 00:16:06.233
It was all planned out.

00:16:07.034 --> 00:16:07.801
And?

00:16:08.702 --> 00:16:11.905
According to witness statements,
the unidentified patient...

00:16:12.239 --> 00:16:14.675
matches the description
of the Ilseong clan's leader.

00:16:16.276 --> 00:16:17.277
But...

00:16:17.611 --> 00:16:19.479
you know what pisses me off?

00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:25.986
Our superiors wanted us to cover this up.

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:27.821
I don't know what changed their minds,

00:16:27.821 --> 00:16:29.890
but now they're demanding
we bring this bastard in.

00:16:29.890 --> 00:16:31.091
(Wanted - voice phishing suspect)

00:16:36.663 --> 00:16:37.698
Well, well.

00:16:38.966 --> 00:16:41.768
It's embarrassing, I'm always
the one asking favors from you.

00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:44.605
Nonsense.

00:16:45.372 --> 00:16:49.142
I was hoping you might reconsider...

00:16:49.142 --> 00:16:51.311
what you said last night.

00:16:52.045 --> 00:16:53.380
You mean about the campaign funding?

00:16:59.152 --> 00:17:02.923
I heard the Democratic People's Party
approached you...

00:17:02.923 --> 00:17:05.626
and the Korea Freedom Party as well.

00:17:05.626 --> 00:17:07.761
Yes, that's how things worked out.

00:17:08.195 --> 00:17:10.831
Talented people get noticed everywhere.

00:17:11.532 --> 00:17:14.801
So, which party have you chosen?

00:17:14.801 --> 00:17:19.139
I need to figure out
which option serves you better,

00:17:19.139 --> 00:17:20.741
so I'll need a bit more time to think.

00:17:20.741 --> 00:17:21.942
That makes two of us.

00:17:22.843 --> 00:17:23.677
Sorry?

00:17:23.677 --> 00:17:25.345
I haven't decided yet.

00:17:26.847 --> 00:17:30.617
I need to think about what's best for me.

00:17:31.718 --> 00:17:32.686
On top of that,

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:35.355
one of my people stole from me.

00:17:36.123 --> 00:17:39.960
We're doing everything we can
to catch Ma Seok Gu.

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:41.361
Just give us a bit more time.

00:17:41.361 --> 00:17:42.596
That said,

00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:44.097
something tells me...

00:17:45.165 --> 00:17:48.635
that my guy was set up by someone.

00:17:49.937 --> 00:17:53.173
So even if you find him,

00:17:53.707 --> 00:17:55.309
my money will already be gone.

00:17:56.343 --> 00:17:57.511
So you're saying...

00:17:58.445 --> 00:18:00.080
Bring me...

00:18:01.014 --> 00:18:02.683
the real thief.

00:18:05.452 --> 00:18:08.488
I'll make sure they learn
what happens to anyone...

00:18:08.488 --> 00:18:10.190
who steals from me.

00:18:11.725 --> 00:18:13.627
Bring them to me,

00:18:13.627 --> 00:18:16.663
and I'll go through with the funding
I withdrew.

00:18:21.201 --> 00:18:22.236
Yes, sir.

00:18:27.374 --> 00:18:29.076
- Welcome.
- Hi.

00:18:31.345 --> 00:18:33.847
I remember you from before.

00:18:33.847 --> 00:18:35.282
You came looking for your mom.

00:18:36.383 --> 00:18:38.018
Were you able to find her?

00:18:38.852 --> 00:18:39.753
Yes, I found her.

00:18:39.753 --> 00:18:41.188
Thank goodness.

00:18:41.588 --> 00:18:44.358
I've been worried ever since that day.

00:18:45.893 --> 00:18:47.628
What kind of flowers do you need?

00:18:48.395 --> 00:18:49.763
Are they for your mom?

00:18:51.565 --> 00:18:54.868
What's typically used for memorials?

00:18:57.838 --> 00:18:58.906
Well...

00:19:01.074 --> 00:19:02.042
(Camellias)

00:19:11.585 --> 00:19:14.621
I'll take these, the camellias.

00:19:33.106 --> 00:19:34.241
By the way,

00:19:35.609 --> 00:19:37.911
you know that guy from earlier, right?

00:19:39.646 --> 00:19:40.581
What guy?

00:19:40.581 --> 00:19:41.582
You don't?

00:19:44.585 --> 00:19:47.621
There was a man here right before you...

00:19:47.621 --> 00:19:49.790
who also bought camellias for a memorial.

00:19:50.257 --> 00:19:52.626
He asked for red ones specifically,

00:19:52.626 --> 00:19:54.161
so I figured you two
might know each other.

00:19:56.196 --> 00:19:58.932
(Love Hall)

00:20:22.055 --> 00:20:26.326
I told you, I can't show
security footage to just anyone.

00:20:26.326 --> 00:20:27.861
Please, just this once.

00:20:27.861 --> 00:20:30.697
Someone I don't know visited my parents,
and I have no clue who it was.

00:20:31.231 --> 00:20:33.467
Probably someone who knew them.

00:20:33.467 --> 00:20:35.569
If I could just see the footage,
I'd know if they were acquainted.

00:20:35.569 --> 00:20:37.971
For crying out loud, you're persistent.

00:20:37.971 --> 00:20:39.573
The answer's no. Please go.

00:20:39.573 --> 00:20:43.210
Then did you happen to see anyone
carrying camellias?

00:20:43.210 --> 00:20:44.645
How am I supposed to remember...

00:20:46.079 --> 00:20:46.914
Hold on.

00:20:47.981 --> 00:20:48.849
Camellias?

00:20:51.118 --> 00:20:53.220
Yeah, I do remember.

00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:56.590
Usually people bring lilies or hyacinths,

00:20:56.590 --> 00:20:59.059
but someone left camellias, which was odd.

00:21:00.527 --> 00:21:01.495
Was it a man?

00:21:01.495 --> 00:21:03.897
What did he look like? How old was he?

00:21:04.298 --> 00:21:05.732
It was a man.

00:21:05.732 --> 00:21:08.769
He had sunglasses on,
so I couldn't really see his face.

00:21:09.903 --> 00:21:13.006
I remember this. He had...

00:21:13.006 --> 00:21:13.907
this weird tattoo on his neck.

00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:22.583
You mean a tattoo like this?

00:21:24.451 --> 00:21:25.385
Like this one?

00:21:26.019 --> 00:21:28.288
Yeah, that looks like it.

00:21:29.489 --> 00:21:30.390
Thank you.

00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:42.503
(I think Ma Seok Gu is still alive.)

00:21:42.503 --> 00:21:44.771
(We need to meet.)

00:21:53.747 --> 00:21:55.215
The commissioner wants to see you.

00:22:01.255 --> 00:22:02.456
I need to ask you something.

00:22:03.390 --> 00:22:06.126
Were you behind
what happened to Ma Seok Gu?

00:22:06.293 --> 00:22:07.261
Of course not.

00:22:07.895 --> 00:22:09.663
How would I know where that bastard is?

00:22:11.131 --> 00:22:12.966
So you're telling me
you had nothing to do with it?

00:22:14.101 --> 00:22:15.102
Like I said, it wasn't me.

00:22:19.473 --> 00:22:20.741
Are we done here?

00:22:20.941 --> 00:22:22.109
Jeong Hun.

00:22:22.109 --> 00:22:23.143
Sorry, I've got somewhere to be.

00:22:33.887 --> 00:22:35.722
Five minutes. I'm coming.

00:22:36.523 --> 00:22:37.758
I can go by myself.

00:22:37.758 --> 00:22:39.660
No way, it's too risky.

00:22:40.994 --> 00:22:43.597
Are you sure it was Ma Seok Gu?

00:22:43.797 --> 00:22:45.332
I'm not sure,

00:22:46.133 --> 00:22:48.368
but the tattoo matches exactly.

00:22:49.503 --> 00:22:50.370
Tattoo?

00:22:51.305 --> 00:22:52.339
You mean...

00:22:54.208 --> 00:22:56.710
that weird irezumi tattoo?

00:22:56.710 --> 00:22:59.813
That son of a bitch came to our house...

00:23:00.113 --> 00:23:01.215
and my parents' restaurant.

00:23:02.082 --> 00:23:03.951
What makes you think so?

00:23:03.951 --> 00:23:04.852
He left clues,

00:23:05.586 --> 00:23:07.888
like going through the mail,

00:23:08.222 --> 00:23:09.690
and leaving flowers behind.

00:23:11.959 --> 00:23:13.694
I heard something at the station today.

00:23:14.862 --> 00:23:16.630
Ma Seok Gu vanished...

00:23:18.699 --> 00:23:19.666
while being transported to the hospital.

00:23:22.803 --> 00:23:24.404
So he's still alive?

00:23:25.506 --> 00:23:26.373
It's possible.

00:23:26.373 --> 00:23:27.708
Then why?

00:23:28.809 --> 00:23:30.711
He's been lurking around.

00:23:31.378 --> 00:23:33.413
He could grab me anytime if he wanted.

00:23:33.814 --> 00:23:34.948
It's like he's trying to intimidate me.

00:23:36.250 --> 00:23:38.719
Don't worry, everything will be fine.

00:23:39.286 --> 00:23:42.356
But something feels off.
Like he's up to something.

00:23:44.758 --> 00:23:45.759
I'm almost there.

00:24:10.017 --> 00:24:10.951
You looking for me?

00:24:35.676 --> 00:24:37.878
One against many looks cool in movies.

00:24:45.219 --> 00:24:46.386
I take that back.

00:25:04.104 --> 00:25:05.072
Hold on.

00:25:09.910 --> 00:25:11.411
Get him. Move!

00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:14.781
Quick, go!

00:25:15.949 --> 00:25:16.884
Catch that son of a bitch!

00:25:23.223 --> 00:25:24.191
Where are you?

00:25:24.191 --> 00:25:25.592
You, check over there.

00:26:10.971 --> 00:26:12.072
What's taking him so long?

00:26:22.783 --> 00:26:23.784
Park Jeong Hun!

00:26:28.856 --> 00:26:29.857
So Min.

00:26:52.145 --> 00:26:54.581
Things might look bad,
but there's always a way.

00:26:54.581 --> 00:26:56.216
Come on, get in.

00:26:59.086 --> 00:27:01.455
The spicy one's mine, cheese is yours.

00:27:02.356 --> 00:27:03.590
We need to call the cops first.

00:27:04.925 --> 00:27:06.293
If we report this as a kidnapping,

00:27:06.293 --> 00:27:08.662
they'll find out we're involved with them.

00:27:09.530 --> 00:27:11.498
We'll end up behind bars too.

00:27:11.798 --> 00:27:13.233
I can't go back to prison.

00:27:13.901 --> 00:27:15.802
So what, we just sit here and do nothing?

00:27:18.639 --> 00:27:20.207
We'll find him on our own.

00:27:21.942 --> 00:27:25.012
We're inseparable.

00:27:27.948 --> 00:27:28.916
They're getting further away.

00:27:29.183 --> 00:27:31.051
Sir, please speed up.

00:27:31.652 --> 00:27:33.287
I'll throw in an extra 50 cents.

00:27:41.094 --> 00:27:43.297
(Power off)

00:27:43.564 --> 00:27:45.098
(Location)

00:27:46.433 --> 00:27:47.501
Oh my gosh.

00:27:48.035 --> 00:27:49.136
What the, what happened?

00:27:50.103 --> 00:27:51.305
Signal's gone.

00:27:51.672 --> 00:27:53.307
I think they noticed something.

00:27:53.774 --> 00:27:54.675
What?

00:28:01.415 --> 00:28:02.349
Hey.

00:28:03.984 --> 00:28:05.018
Hey.

00:28:14.528 --> 00:28:15.762
Let me ask you one last time.

00:28:16.563 --> 00:28:18.765
Where's the money?

00:28:19.499 --> 00:28:21.101
You think money fetches itself...

00:28:21.401 --> 00:28:22.803
when you snap your fingers?

00:28:47.227 --> 00:28:48.862
(Speaker)

00:28:49.263 --> 00:28:50.097
Hello?

00:28:51.932 --> 00:28:52.866
Hello?

00:28:53.634 --> 00:28:56.036
Losing your parents should've been enough.

00:28:56.036 --> 00:28:58.906
Why'd you have to steal from me
and make things worse?

00:28:59.506 --> 00:29:02.543
Transfer the money you stole from me
to a cold wallet.

00:29:02.543 --> 00:29:05.112
Drop it in locker two at Gyodong Station
by tomorrow night.

00:29:05.646 --> 00:29:07.548
If I'm short even one penny,

00:29:07.548 --> 00:29:10.083
your friend will end up like your parents.

00:29:10.984 --> 00:29:12.319
(Video)

00:29:16.890 --> 00:29:18.492
You think the money will just appear...

00:29:18.926 --> 00:29:20.160
when you snap your fingers?

00:29:35.609 --> 00:29:37.511
Mom!

00:29:41.982 --> 00:29:43.050
We should give it back.

00:29:44.117 --> 00:29:44.918
What?

00:29:44.918 --> 00:29:45.819
The money.

00:29:47.354 --> 00:29:48.555
I'm telling you, let's give it back.

00:29:48.722 --> 00:29:50.624
Hold on, just calm down.

00:29:50.624 --> 00:29:53.727
But his life is on the line,
how can I calm down...?

00:29:56.463 --> 00:29:57.397
I'm sorry.

00:30:00.567 --> 00:30:03.837
I just can't watch more people die.

00:30:05.706 --> 00:30:07.107
Even if it's not a glamorous path,

00:30:07.107 --> 00:30:09.042
if it's easy for you to walk,
it's a good path.

00:30:09.443 --> 00:30:11.411
I want you to pick yourself up...

00:30:11.411 --> 00:30:13.580
and figure out the right path for you.

00:30:14.248 --> 00:30:16.517
I won't let you throw everything away.

00:30:18.752 --> 00:30:19.653
Do Jin.

00:30:21.288 --> 00:30:22.789
Can you transfer the money...

00:30:22.789 --> 00:30:24.892
into that cold wallet thing right now?

00:30:25.759 --> 00:30:27.895
You're seriously giving it back?

00:30:39.439 --> 00:30:40.474
Even my one and only...

00:30:41.642 --> 00:30:43.510
Ms. Kim is abandoning me.

00:30:48.715 --> 00:30:50.017
What's the point anymore?

00:30:51.351 --> 00:30:52.519
I might as well just die.

00:31:16.777 --> 00:31:19.012
Pathetic piece of shit.

00:31:22.816 --> 00:31:23.584
What?

00:31:47.474 --> 00:31:48.775
Please don't kill me.

00:31:48.775 --> 00:31:50.344
I'll pay back everything I owe
by tomorrow.

00:31:58.318 --> 00:32:00.120
Where in Korea...

00:32:01.522 --> 00:32:02.389
could Ma Seok Gu be hiding?

00:32:03.824 --> 00:32:04.825
I don't know.

00:32:06.293 --> 00:32:07.528
I don't know anything.

00:32:09.363 --> 00:32:10.898
I swear, I don't know.

00:32:11.598 --> 00:32:14.835
Because of that bastard Ma Seok Gu,

00:32:14.835 --> 00:32:16.069
my life is completely fucked.

00:32:21.408 --> 00:32:22.776
As ruined as mine?

00:32:24.378 --> 00:32:26.013
Well, not exactly.

00:32:26.013 --> 00:32:27.881
I never meant for that to happen.

00:32:27.881 --> 00:32:28.782
I'm sorry.

00:32:34.488 --> 00:32:35.556
How about we team up?

00:32:37.691 --> 00:32:39.693
What? Team up with you?

00:32:40.027 --> 00:32:41.228
You're out of your mind.

00:32:41.795 --> 00:32:43.297
Even if I've hit rock bottom,

00:32:43.297 --> 00:32:45.132
you think I'd work with someone
who used to work under me?

00:32:47.935 --> 00:32:48.735
What is it?

00:32:49.903 --> 00:32:51.705
(Wanted - voice phishing suspect)
(Ma Seok Gu)

00:32:51.705 --> 00:32:53.006
There's fifty grand if we pull this off.

00:32:53.841 --> 00:32:54.641
We split it.

00:32:55.876 --> 00:32:57.044
Only $50,000?

00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:01.148
I take sixty, you get forty.

00:33:01.748 --> 00:33:02.516
Six.

00:33:03.250 --> 00:33:04.084
Four.

00:33:05.419 --> 00:33:07.387
Forget it,
why would I chase pocket change?

00:33:07.387 --> 00:33:08.255
Seventy-thirty.

00:33:09.756 --> 00:33:10.657
Seven...

00:33:11.525 --> 00:33:13.227
Still not enough.

00:33:18.165 --> 00:33:19.466
Ninety-ten. That's my final offer.

00:33:20.234 --> 00:33:22.135
Where do I start?

00:33:25.839 --> 00:33:27.741
Wait, just listen for a second.

00:33:28.342 --> 00:33:30.544
Come on,

00:33:30.544 --> 00:33:32.312
you need to know
what you're signing up for.

00:33:32.312 --> 00:33:33.247
Exactly.

00:33:33.914 --> 00:33:36.984
So I'm paying you $1,000 upfront, got it?

00:33:36.984 --> 00:33:38.519
Stop overthinking and just do it.

00:33:38.519 --> 00:33:41.088
Wait, this is illegal, isn't it?

00:33:41.321 --> 00:33:42.389
Forget it then.

00:33:42.389 --> 00:33:43.824
Unbelievable.

00:33:47.427 --> 00:33:48.462
Listen up.

00:33:48.462 --> 00:33:49.696
We're going to be...

00:33:50.497 --> 00:33:51.465
being antiheroes.

00:33:51.732 --> 00:33:53.467
Anti... what?

00:33:54.168 --> 00:33:55.002
What the hell is that?

00:33:55.702 --> 00:33:57.471
I use anti-aging products too.

00:33:57.471 --> 00:33:58.539
Dumbass.

00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:00.674
So it means...

00:34:01.074 --> 00:34:02.576
Never mind, Just trust me.

00:34:03.143 --> 00:34:04.945
It means you're a villain who does good.

00:34:04.945 --> 00:34:06.313
That makes zero sense.

00:34:06.313 --> 00:34:08.115
Hey, you don't trust me?

00:34:08.115 --> 00:34:10.684
- Get in here.
- You're in then?

00:34:14.354 --> 00:34:15.355
What's the job?

00:34:15.856 --> 00:34:18.158
How should I know?

00:34:21.862 --> 00:34:24.731
Wait, you're
the Chinese-Korean from earlier.

00:34:24.731 --> 00:34:26.133
Wow.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.437
Pretty sweet setup you got here.

00:34:31.271 --> 00:34:33.740
Funny how nobody's behind bars.

00:34:39.079 --> 00:34:41.381
You've got customer records
at your shop, right?

00:34:41.381 --> 00:34:43.483
Nope. The cops took everything.

00:34:43.684 --> 00:34:44.618
Is that so?

00:34:47.421 --> 00:34:50.524
Out of these accounts made with
stolen identities...

00:34:50.524 --> 00:34:51.825
These ones?

00:34:52.159 --> 00:34:53.660
Mr. Lee Seung Tae right here...

00:34:53.660 --> 00:34:55.662
begged me, so I couldn't say no.

00:34:55.662 --> 00:34:57.764
You were happy enough
when I offered money.

00:34:58.131 --> 00:35:00.334
Still cost me extra though.

00:35:00.534 --> 00:35:02.836
Even the foreigners figured it out quick.

00:35:02.836 --> 00:35:04.538
You think they'd hand over
their info for free?

00:35:04.538 --> 00:35:06.106
Cost me fifty bucks each.

00:35:06.106 --> 00:35:09.576
That Kazakh guy, Obolbek?

00:35:09.877 --> 00:35:12.646
He pushed to sell, so I helped him out.

00:35:12.646 --> 00:35:15.082
Hey, I paid for it.
That makes it legal, right?

00:35:15.082 --> 00:35:16.049
Whatever.

00:35:16.683 --> 00:35:19.052
Give me info on a few more people,
including the Kazakh.

00:35:20.153 --> 00:35:21.288
Also, for the Ilseong clan,

00:35:21.588 --> 00:35:23.390
where do I post a job listing
for a collector?

00:35:30.964 --> 00:35:33.133
(High-paid part-time job available)
(Simple collection work)

00:35:47.514 --> 00:35:48.549
Mr. Obolbek?

00:35:53.487 --> 00:35:55.055
I'm the one who called yesterday.

00:35:57.424 --> 00:35:59.026
Can we talk for a moment?

00:36:00.594 --> 00:36:03.764
You'll be managing clients
for our company.

00:36:04.264 --> 00:36:06.366
When do I start?

00:36:06.366 --> 00:36:10.537
Normal hours are nine to six,
Monday through Friday.

00:36:10.537 --> 00:36:13.106
But we have an urgent job today,

00:36:13.106 --> 00:36:15.142
so we need you to start right away.

00:36:15.142 --> 00:36:17.778
Okay, I understand. It's urgent.

00:36:17.778 --> 00:36:18.745
Understood.

00:36:18.745 --> 00:36:21.715
This client declared bankruptcy
and has serious problems,

00:36:21.715 --> 00:36:24.551
so they can't make bank deposits directly.

00:36:24.551 --> 00:36:26.653
It's a large amount,
that's why we need you.

00:36:26.954 --> 00:36:29.389
Where do you need me?

00:36:29.790 --> 00:36:31.692
Head to Gyodong Station.

00:37:00.721 --> 00:37:03.023
Once you've picked up the package,
head to Seongan Intersection Station.

00:37:03.023 --> 00:37:05.492
Seongan Intersection Station?

00:37:05.492 --> 00:37:08.262
Hand it off to our guy at Exit 3.

00:37:24.144 --> 00:37:26.180
Once you get the package
from the client's courier,

00:37:26.180 --> 00:37:28.315
look for the waffle cart on Buil-ro 3-gil.

00:37:43.997 --> 00:37:45.899
- Head to Buil Community Center.
- Sir.

00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:48.268
Sir, Buil Community Center, please.

00:37:50.037 --> 00:37:52.739
(Location of S14)

00:37:56.810 --> 00:37:58.946
Use this phone going forward.

00:38:00.347 --> 00:38:01.348
We'll call you.

00:38:04.318 --> 00:38:05.118
Wait.

00:38:05.919 --> 00:38:09.389
Stop selling your personal information.

00:38:22.336 --> 00:38:24.771
Pull over here, please.

00:38:57.738 --> 00:39:00.240
Follow that car, please.

00:40:22.523 --> 00:40:23.357
You're here?

00:40:24.324 --> 00:40:26.226
What happened? Are you okay?

00:40:26.393 --> 00:40:27.194
I'm fine.

00:40:30.898 --> 00:40:31.698
So Min.

00:40:32.699 --> 00:40:34.368
Do you remember what I said?

00:40:35.102 --> 00:40:38.705
Everyone seems to have
their own right path.

00:40:45.579 --> 00:40:46.747
What are you doing?

00:40:53.353 --> 00:40:54.221
Sorry.

00:40:55.622 --> 00:40:56.723
This is my path.

00:41:03.130 --> 00:41:05.566
A guy came before you...

00:41:05.933 --> 00:41:08.001
and also bought camellias for memorials.

00:41:08.335 --> 00:41:09.536
It was a guy.

00:41:09.770 --> 00:41:13.073
He had sunglasses on,
so I don't really remember his face.

00:41:13.974 --> 00:41:15.876
I remember this. He had...

00:41:15.876 --> 00:41:17.911
this weird tattoo on his neck.

00:41:19.046 --> 00:41:20.113
Oh my gosh.

00:41:20.113 --> 00:41:21.315
What the, what happened?

00:41:21.315 --> 00:41:22.616
Signal's gone.

00:41:23.016 --> 00:41:24.585
I think they noticed something.

00:41:24.918 --> 00:41:25.886
What?

00:41:30.691 --> 00:41:31.425
That's enough.

00:41:34.862 --> 00:41:35.729
How is it?

00:41:37.264 --> 00:41:38.198
Does it seem real?

00:41:39.533 --> 00:41:41.468
At this point, maybe the money...

00:41:41.468 --> 00:41:43.070
and whoever the chairman thinks
stole it...

00:41:44.204 --> 00:41:46.073
will reveal themselves.

00:41:52.212 --> 00:41:53.780
How long?

00:42:11.465 --> 00:42:12.332
All right then.

00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:14.334
Good luck.

00:42:19.373 --> 00:42:20.641
You son of a bitch!

00:42:34.488 --> 00:42:35.789
Damn it.

00:43:06.353 --> 00:43:08.689
(No Mercy)

00:43:09.056 --> 00:43:10.424
Did you know...

00:43:10.424 --> 00:43:12.292
that Park Jeong Hun is working
with the Ilseong clan?

00:43:12.860 --> 00:43:15.295
You received a video call,

00:43:15.295 --> 00:43:16.396
and it was me calling?

00:43:16.396 --> 00:43:19.166
Your son's quite something, Commissioner.

00:43:19.166 --> 00:43:21.468
You'll pit father against son?

00:43:21.468 --> 00:43:23.237
That doesn't make sense.

00:43:23.737 --> 00:43:25.606
Any word on the woman who got away?

00:43:25.606 --> 00:43:28.075
We've looked all over,

00:43:28.075 --> 00:43:29.209
but nothing yet.

00:43:29.676 --> 00:43:30.677
Tell me the truth.

00:43:30.944 --> 00:43:32.513
You had your own agenda
when you joined, didn't you?

00:43:32.513 --> 00:43:33.280
I know.

00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:36.250
You should be scamming,
not getting scammed.

00:43:36.783 --> 00:43:38.418
You barely know him.

00:43:38.418 --> 00:43:40.120
And you really trust him?

00:43:40.521 --> 00:43:42.356
Show me you're trustworthy.

00:43:43.991 --> 00:43:45.492
Die!

00:43:46.864 --> 00:43:48.864
