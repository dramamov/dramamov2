get drunk quickly.

00:08:12.669 --> 00:08:14.268
I'm upset?

00:08:16.029 --> 00:08:17.989
I'm happy right now.

00:08:19.388 --> 00:08:20.709
Stop pretending.

00:08:21.469 --> 00:08:22.388
I saw everything.

00:08:22.508 --> 00:08:23.628
Yan didn't ask you to stay,

00:08:23.868 --> 00:08:24.709
and your face showed

00:08:25.748 --> 00:08:26.349
disappointment.

00:08:30.989 --> 00:08:31.709
Yiming.

00:08:33.508 --> 00:08:34.189
Tell me,

00:08:35.229 --> 00:08:36.268
have I been

00:08:36.268 --> 00:08:37.989
sincere enough?

00:08:38.309 --> 00:08:38.908
Yes.

00:08:39.748 --> 00:08:41.589
I've tried everything I have,

00:08:42.628 --> 00:08:43.989
and tried everything

00:08:43.989 --> 00:08:45.069
to win her back,

00:08:46.069 --> 00:08:46.949
yet she ignored it.

00:08:53.309 --> 00:08:53.989
Yiming.

00:08:55.908 --> 00:08:57.989
I'm done with her.

00:08:58.668 --> 00:08:59.628
Alright, done with her.

00:09:01.229 --> 00:09:03.069
I won't call her anymore.

00:09:07.189 --> 00:09:08.949
If I ever call her again,

00:09:11.829 --> 00:09:12.469
I'm not a Shen.

00:09:13.709 --> 00:09:14.429
Stop drinking.

00:09:23.268 --> 00:09:23.829
Yan.

00:09:24.148 --> 00:09:25.229
I had Meng Zhao

00:09:25.589 --> 00:09:26.868
take Jiang Liang home.

00:09:28.349 --> 00:09:28.989
Let's leave.

00:09:30.148 --> 00:09:31.028
Come on, let's go.

00:09:31.628 --> 00:09:32.349
Wait.

00:09:32.989 --> 00:09:34.189
One last high note to hit.

00:09:39.748 --> 00:09:40.709
Beautiful. Let's go.

00:09:41.709 --> 00:09:42.589
To where?

00:09:43.548 --> 00:09:43.989
Sit down.

00:09:44.469 --> 00:09:45.229
Let's drink more.

00:09:45.548 --> 00:09:47.748
More? You're already drunk.

00:09:48.268 --> 00:09:49.109
I'm not drunk.

00:09:49.709 --> 00:09:50.349
If you say that,

00:09:50.429 --> 00:09:51.788
I'll get upset.

00:09:52.268 --> 00:09:53.028
I'm not drunk,

00:09:53.109 --> 00:09:53.949
but happy.

00:09:53.989 --> 00:09:54.908
Pure joy.

00:09:55.668 --> 00:09:56.508
I think everything

00:09:56.508 --> 00:09:57.429
is perfect now.

00:09:57.668 --> 00:09:58.548
Drink with me.

00:10:00.109 --> 00:10:01.109
Drowning your sorrows,

00:10:01.148 --> 00:10:01.548
right?

00:10:02.668 --> 00:10:04.109
Alright.

00:10:04.748 --> 00:10:06.148
You're upset to let him leave.

00:10:06.189 --> 00:10:07.148
Then you should have

00:10:07.148 --> 00:10:07.868
asked him to stay.

00:10:07.868 --> 00:10:09.028
Now, you're upset.

00:10:09.229 --> 00:10:10.829
I'm not upset.

00:10:11.949 --> 00:10:13.268
I'm happy.

00:10:13.548 --> 00:10:14.309
Stop pretending.

00:10:14.469 --> 00:10:15.309
Think I can't tell?

00:10:15.709 --> 00:10:16.429
I have you all.

00:10:17.268 --> 00:10:18.109
You all love me.

00:10:19.109 --> 00:10:20.268
And I have Yan Studio.

00:10:21.268 --> 00:10:22.788
So many things make me happy.

00:10:23.589 --> 00:10:25.309
I don't care if he wants to leave.

00:10:26.349 --> 00:10:26.829
Don't stay.

00:10:27.069 --> 00:10:27.868
Just walk.

00:10:28.748 --> 00:10:29.309
Don't stay.

00:10:29.709 --> 00:10:30.388
Would I stay?

00:10:30.508 --> 00:10:31.309
I won't either.

00:10:31.868 --> 00:10:32.668
It doesn't matter.

00:10:33.309 --> 00:10:34.309
Who cares?

00:10:35.989 --> 00:10:37.069
Who cares if Shen Haoming

00:10:37.109 --> 00:10:37.949
loves me.

00:10:39.908 --> 00:10:40.589
Stop it.

00:10:41.309 --> 00:10:41.949
Need a gulp.

00:10:58.788 --> 00:11:00.388
Yan, answer the phone.

00:11:00.829 --> 00:11:02.189
I got signal here.

00:11:02.508 --> 00:11:03.189
Yan.

00:11:03.548 --> 00:11:04.788
Answer the phone.

00:11:04.989 --> 00:11:05.868
Get down here.

00:11:06.028 --> 00:11:07.268
You swore you'd never call her.

00:11:08.028 --> 00:11:08.589
Listen.

00:11:08.668 --> 00:11:09.508
Calling her now

00:11:09.548 --> 00:11:10.268
disgusts her more.

00:11:12.148 --> 00:11:13.469
I would never disgust Yan.

00:11:13.989 --> 00:11:14.908
She loves me,

00:11:14.908 --> 00:11:16.388
right, Yan?

00:11:18.028 --> 00:11:18.949
Yan!

00:11:19.628 --> 00:11:20.949
Haoming, listen.

00:11:20.989 --> 00:11:21.989
You're no Shen anymore.

00:11:22.628 --> 00:11:24.069
I don't care. Yan.

00:11:24.388 --> 00:11:25.229
I love you.

00:11:25.469 --> 00:11:26.748
Answer the phone.

00:11:27.508 --> 00:11:28.748
Why did you open the window?

00:11:29.668 --> 00:11:31.148
I think someone's calling me.

00:11:31.788 --> 00:11:32.628
Who is it?

00:11:32.949 --> 00:11:33.788
No one's calling you.

00:11:33.989 --> 00:11:34.349
Come on.

00:11:34.349 --> 00:11:35.268
Someone's calling me.

00:11:35.589 --> 00:11:36.069
Who is it?

00:11:36.069 --> 00:11:37.668
Alright.

00:11:41.309 --> 00:11:42.229
I feel terrible.

00:11:43.109 --> 00:11:43.868
I want to go home.

00:11:44.229 --> 00:11:45.349
Okay, we're going back.

00:11:45.429 --> 00:11:46.268
We'll be there soon.

00:11:48.668 --> 00:11:49.148
Wait.

00:11:51.069 --> 00:11:52.069
This isn't my house.

00:11:52.788 --> 00:11:53.469
It is.

00:11:53.989 --> 00:11:54.829
No, my house

00:11:55.589 --> 00:11:56.868
is not on this way.

00:11:58.388 --> 00:12:00.788
I live at Building 7, 33 East District.

00:12:00.949 --> 00:12:01.908
Where are we?

00:12:02.148 --> 00:12:02.429
Well,

00:12:02.589 --> 00:12:03.829
we're on the way to your place.

00:12:03.829 --> 00:12:04.148
This...

00:12:04.148 --> 00:12:04.868
No.

00:12:05.309 --> 00:12:05.908
Turn around.

00:12:06.349 --> 00:12:07.229
Where are you going?

00:12:07.229 --> 00:12:08.349
Turn around!

00:12:09.748 --> 00:12:10.788
Don't be a gate-crasher.

00:12:10.868 --> 00:12:12.469
I'm not. That's my house.

00:12:12.868 --> 00:12:13.268
Where?

00:12:13.309 --> 00:12:13.908
I don't know.

00:12:13.989 --> 00:12:14.829
My house!

00:12:15.028 --> 00:12:16.309
Don't you live in Lugang?

00:12:17.429 --> 00:12:18.349
Kind of.

00:12:19.268 --> 00:12:20.788
No. Turn around!

00:12:21.268 --> 00:12:22.309
Turn around.

00:12:25.189 --> 00:12:25.508
Hey...

00:12:25.989 --> 00:12:26.908
Think it carefully.

00:12:26.949 --> 00:12:27.668
Where is it?

00:12:28.388 --> 00:12:29.429
Don't be a gate-crasher.

00:12:29.508 --> 00:12:29.949
You!

00:12:30.189 --> 00:12:30.709
Alright.

00:12:30.748 --> 00:12:31.429
Take a rest.

00:12:35.868 --> 00:12:36.668
I'm back.

00:12:36.868 --> 00:12:37.628
Okay, come back.

00:12:41.589 --> 00:12:43.069
I'll be back soon.

00:12:43.429 --> 00:12:44.069
Jeez!

00:12:48.748 --> 00:12:49.829
Wait for me.

00:13:33.788 --> 00:13:34.548
Stop it.

00:13:49.949 --> 00:13:50.548
Well...

00:13:52.109 --> 00:13:53.309
I drank too much last night.

00:13:55.949 --> 00:13:56.709
It's okay.

00:14:03.069 --> 00:14:04.309
No one knows I'm here,

00:14:04.508 --> 00:14:05.028
anyway.

00:14:07.548 --> 00:14:08.148
Who is it?

00:14:09.748 --> 00:14:10.628
Haoming, are you up?

00:14:11.189 --> 00:14:11.989
It's almost noon.

00:14:11.989 --> 00:14:12.589
Get up.

00:14:13.189 --> 00:14:13.868
Why is he here?

00:14:15.709 --> 00:14:16.548
Why are you here?

00:14:16.589 --> 00:14:17.268
I'm here too.

00:14:18.829 --> 00:14:19.388
Yan.

00:14:19.748 --> 00:14:21.148
You two blacked out last night.

00:14:21.548 --> 00:14:22.388
Want to know

00:14:22.429 --> 00:14:23.668
what happened yesterday?

00:14:24.349 --> 00:14:25.148
Get dressed.

00:14:25.309 --> 00:14:26.148
Come see the video!

00:14:32.829 --> 00:14:34.189
You go get dressed.

00:14:35.908 --> 00:14:36.469
It's okay.

00:14:37.109 --> 00:14:37.709
You first.

00:14:38.429 --> 00:14:39.028
I won't look.

00:14:54.148 --> 00:14:54.829
The quilt.

00:14:57.589 --> 00:14:58.268
The quilt.

00:15:01.628 --> 00:15:02.148
Sorry.

00:15:02.189 --> 00:15:03.028
Don't move.

00:15:08.748 --> 00:15:09.148
Come.

00:15:09.429 --> 00:15:10.069
Easy, easy.

00:15:10.508 --> 00:15:11.628
Yiming, you're the best.

00:15:11.748 --> 00:15:13.429
You're so nice to drink with me.

00:15:13.469 --> 00:15:13.989
Okay.

00:15:14.309 --> 00:15:15.349
You're home.

00:15:15.949 --> 00:15:16.508
Alright.

00:15:17.508 --> 00:15:18.868
Why is this a bar?

00:15:19.268 --> 00:15:20.148
No, you're home.

00:15:20.148 --> 00:15:21.148
This is a bar!

00:15:22.069 --> 00:15:23.309
Such a beautiful bar!

00:15:23.829 --> 00:15:24.748
Sit down first.

00:15:24.868 --> 00:15:25.268
Sit down.

00:15:25.309 --> 00:15:26.429
- There's a sofa here.
- Bar.

00:15:31.429 --> 00:15:32.229
Open the door.

00:15:33.189 --> 00:15:34.069
Open the door.

00:15:35.628 --> 00:15:36.508
Honey!

00:15:38.229 --> 00:15:39.148
Honey!

00:15:41.748 --> 00:15:42.349
Why here?

00:15:43.349 --> 00:15:44.189
Isn't it obvious?

00:15:45.508 --> 00:15:46.189
I'm home.

00:15:47.829 --> 00:15:48.868
I feel like throwing up.

00:15:51.548 --> 00:15:53.469
Why did you drink so much?

00:15:54.268 --> 00:15:54.748
No.

00:15:55.388 --> 00:15:57.268
Why did you drink so much?

00:15:57.589 --> 00:15:59.069
Wait, why is there

00:15:59.069 --> 00:15:59.949
a stranger?

00:16:00.109 --> 00:16:00.908
It's so late now.

00:16:00.949 --> 00:16:02.788
Staying out this late?

00:16:03.189 --> 00:16:03.628
Get out.

00:16:04.829 --> 00:16:05.508
Who are you?

00:16:05.788 --> 00:16:07.028
Who are you?

00:16:07.788 --> 00:16:08.508
Call the police!

00:16:08.788 --> 00:16:10.788
This is my bar!

00:16:11.388 --> 00:16:12.709
This is my bar!

00:16:12.788 --> 00:16:13.949
Why call the police?

00:16:13.989 --> 00:16:15.349
This is my house.

00:16:15.508 --> 00:16:16.628
This is my house.

00:16:16.628 --> 00:16:17.189
My house!

00:16:17.309 --> 00:16:17.989
My house!

00:16:18.109 --> 00:16:18.709
Mine!

00:16:19.189 --> 00:16:20.268
Why did you bring her here?

00:16:20.309 --> 00:16:21.508
- They're fighting now!
- Want a fight?

00:16:21.508 --> 00:16:22.349
- Think I wanted this?
- Alright.

00:16:22.788 --> 00:16:23.589
She insisted on

00:16:23.589 --> 00:16:24.388
going here.

00:16:24.429 --> 00:16:25.109
What could I do?

00:16:26.109 --> 00:16:27.388
Stop making things up.

00:16:27.628 --> 00:16:28.349
Not that dramatic.

00:16:28.349 --> 00:16:29.429
I'm just telling

00:16:29.668 --> 00:16:30.429
the truth,

00:16:30.668 --> 00:16:31.788
or I'll take your last name.

00:16:32.388 --> 00:16:33.628
But you lost your surname.

00:16:34.788 --> 00:16:35.309
Well...

00:16:36.748 --> 00:16:37.628
That means

00:16:37.908 --> 00:16:39.148
you two stayed here

00:16:39.229 --> 00:16:40.229
last night, right?

00:16:42.189 --> 00:16:43.028
It's because you two

00:16:43.429 --> 00:16:44.309
were unpredictable!

00:16:44.829 --> 00:16:46.668
One second you're enemies...

00:16:46.748 --> 00:16:47.508
The next

00:16:47.668 --> 00:16:48.709
you were inseparable.

00:16:49.949 --> 00:16:50.709
I want to throw up.

00:16:51.349 --> 00:16:52.748
Put me down!

00:16:53.109 --> 00:16:53.748
I'm warning you,

00:16:54.189 --> 00:16:55.028
I'll count to three.

00:16:55.148 --> 00:16:56.069
Put me down now!

00:16:56.229 --> 00:16:56.748
Go ahead.

00:16:57.189 --> 00:16:57.668
Three.

00:17:02.748 --> 00:17:03.388
Three.

00:17:06.108 --> 00:17:06.669
Three.

00:17:08.068 --> 00:17:08.588
Yan! Yan!

00:17:08.588 --> 00:17:09.469
Be careful.

00:17:10.669 --> 00:17:11.389
Be careful.

00:17:12.508 --> 00:17:13.149
I'm dizzy.

00:17:13.629 --> 00:17:14.268
Honey.

00:17:16.588 --> 00:17:17.508
You're so beautiful.

00:17:17.548 --> 00:17:19.229
Honey, you're so manly.

00:17:20.949 --> 00:17:22.308
You're finally back.

00:17:22.828 --> 00:17:23.548
Did you hear

00:17:23.548 --> 00:17:25.308
me calling your name?

00:17:25.629 --> 00:17:27.429
I knew it was you calling me.

00:17:28.669 --> 00:17:29.669
Good that you heard.

00:17:32.189 --> 00:17:32.909
Let's go.

00:17:33.788 --> 00:17:34.308
Wait!

00:17:36.469 --> 00:17:37.028
Put me down!

00:17:37.588 --> 00:17:38.308
Now!

00:17:39.788 --> 00:17:42.068
Who is this?

00:17:43.308 --> 00:17:44.709
Where is my wedding photo?

00:17:46.308 --> 00:17:47.909
Whose back is this?

00:17:48.469 --> 00:17:49.909
Don't rush. Wait for me.

00:17:56.828 --> 00:17:58.548
This is my back.

00:18:00.588 --> 00:18:02.308
No. Don't try to fool me.

00:18:02.669 --> 00:18:03.788
This one is slimmer.

00:18:04.389 --> 00:18:05.028
See?

00:18:06.348 --> 00:18:09.068
The shoulders
are much leaner than yours.

00:18:09.308 --> 00:18:09.989
Understand?

00:18:10.389 --> 00:18:12.068
This was before I built muscle.

00:18:13.068 --> 00:18:13.629
This...

00:18:15.429 --> 00:18:16.348
I am

00:18:17.588 --> 00:18:19.229
facing my wife.

00:18:20.548 --> 00:18:22.108
Right here.

00:18:23.508 --> 00:18:24.949
My wife is so beautiful.

00:18:25.788 --> 00:18:26.869
Right here.

00:18:28.028 --> 00:18:28.669
Honey.

00:18:29.268 --> 00:18:29.828
Come.

00:18:32.068 --> 00:18:34.108
First pan-fry the tuna.

00:18:34.508 --> 00:18:35.068
Okay?

00:18:35.909 --> 00:18:38.268
Golden brown on both sides, okay?

00:18:39.828 --> 00:18:40.268
Hungry.

00:18:40.709 --> 00:18:41.788
Should be fine now.

00:18:43.548 --> 00:18:45.108
Which one do you want?

00:18:47.469 --> 00:18:47.989
This one?

00:18:48.788 --> 00:18:49.828
The one that just swam by.

00:18:49.949 --> 00:18:50.469
This one?

00:18:50.629 --> 00:18:51.949
That one! That one!

00:18:52.149 --> 00:18:53.828
They aren't sober at all.

00:18:54.669 --> 00:18:55.949
What if something

00:18:55.949 --> 00:18:56.308
happens?

00:18:56.709 --> 00:18:58.149
Maybe we should stay.

00:18:58.348 --> 00:18:58.949
Makes sense.

00:18:59.748 --> 00:19:00.748
I'm afraid they'd really

00:19:00.869 --> 00:19:01.629
eat live fish.

00:19:02.268 --> 00:19:03.149
I want to eat it.

00:19:10.828 --> 00:19:11.508
Don't!

00:19:12.548 --> 00:19:13.268
Not here.

00:19:14.068 --> 00:19:14.869
It's cold here.

00:19:14.989 --> 00:19:16.028
- You'll catch cold.
- Don't.

00:19:16.108 --> 00:19:16.588
Don't.

00:19:16.828 --> 00:19:17.548
Go to the bedroom.

00:19:17.629 --> 00:19:18.548
Where's the bedroom?

00:19:18.548 --> 00:19:19.028
Bedroom!

00:19:21.788 --> 00:19:22.709
You know what?

00:19:23.348 --> 00:19:24.588
You two were too wild.

00:19:25.028 --> 00:19:25.508
Right there,

00:19:26.108 --> 00:19:27.989
you kept taking
clothes off and touching.

00:19:28.149 --> 00:19:29.108
We were worried you'd

00:19:29.189 --> 00:19:30.308
catch cold,

00:19:30.709 --> 00:19:31.788
so we sent you upstairs.

00:19:31.788 --> 00:19:32.828
But you still did wild.

00:19:34.949 --> 00:19:35.268
Fine.

00:19:36.389 --> 00:19:37.028
Then stop.

00:19:37.189 --> 00:19:37.548
Right.

00:19:37.828 --> 00:19:39.389
I'm getting a break. I'll take her out.

00:19:39.389 --> 00:19:39.669
Right.

00:19:39.709 --> 00:19:41.108
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

00:19:41.548 --> 00:19:42.949
I want to go out too.

00:19:43.429 --> 00:19:44.989
You? You go with him.

00:19:45.028 --> 00:19:45.909
I need to go date.

00:19:46.068 --> 00:19:46.748
I'm leaving. Bye.

00:19:46.788 --> 00:19:47.588
Let's go.

00:19:53.229 --> 00:19:54.629
Shall we...

00:19:56.548 --> 00:19:57.588
I need to work today.

00:20:00.268 --> 00:20:01.068
Me too.

00:20:07.189 --> 00:20:08.989
Did I bring my bag yesterday?

00:20:11.028 --> 00:20:11.788
I'll look for it.

00:20:12.229 --> 00:20:12.748
Thanks.

00:20:16.268 --> 00:20:17.429
Can't be here.

00:20:18.508 --> 00:20:19.308
I'll look for it.

00:20:24.189 --> 00:20:24.709
This...

00:20:25.149 --> 00:20:25.588
Nothing.

00:20:25.748 --> 00:20:26.268
No?

00:20:26.748 --> 00:20:27.788
Not here either?

00:20:28.068 --> 00:20:28.588
Let me see.

00:20:33.788 --> 00:20:34.308
Over there.

00:20:35.028 --> 00:20:35.508
There.

00:20:37.669 --> 00:20:38.149
Right.

00:20:44.469 --> 00:20:45.268
Found it.

00:20:46.189 --> 00:20:46.869
Hard to find.

00:20:46.869 --> 00:20:47.909
Well...

00:20:48.629 --> 00:20:49.429
I'm leaving.

00:20:52.548 --> 00:20:54.189
Want to grab a meal before that?

00:20:57.229 --> 00:20:57.828
Sounds good.

00:21:00.669 --> 00:21:01.669
What would you like?

00:21:02.748 --> 00:21:03.429
Anything is fine.

00:21:05.469 --> 00:21:05.989
Like what?

00:21:08.869 --> 00:21:09.629
Haoming.

00:21:09.869 --> 00:21:11.149
I bought you food.

00:21:11.348 --> 00:21:12.348
Are you home?

00:21:25.389 --> 00:21:25.949
She left.

00:21:33.108 --> 00:21:33.669
Yes.

00:21:38.629 --> 00:21:39.548
I am still here.

00:21:46.508 --> 00:21:47.548
Morning, Mom.

00:21:48.909 --> 00:21:49.348
Look.

00:21:49.389 --> 00:21:49.909
This is good.

00:21:49.909 --> 00:21:50.429
Quite sturdy.

00:21:51.828 --> 00:21:53.028
We're doing

00:21:53.149 --> 00:21:53.709
exercises.

00:21:55.508 --> 00:21:56.189
Tricep training.

00:21:56.189 --> 00:21:57.149
Very good.

00:21:58.788 --> 00:21:59.068
Nice.

00:21:59.108 --> 00:21:59.588
Well done.

00:21:59.909 --> 00:22:00.348
Work?

00:22:00.348 --> 00:22:00.869
Great.

00:22:01.268 --> 00:22:01.788
Go to work.

00:22:01.788 --> 00:22:02.189
Work.

00:22:02.469 --> 00:22:03.189
Okay, me too.

00:22:04.429 --> 00:22:04.909
Pants.

00:22:06.949 --> 00:22:07.828
I'm going to work out.

00:22:08.588 --> 00:22:09.229
He's so cute.

00:22:09.229 --> 00:22:10.469
Mom, want to work out?

00:22:10.469 --> 00:22:11.068
- Work out.
- Yes.

00:22:12.508 --> 00:22:13.548
I bought some breakfast.

00:22:13.949 --> 00:22:14.909
How about...

00:22:17.108 --> 00:22:17.469
Perfect.

00:22:17.669 --> 00:22:18.788
Let me help you, Mom.

00:22:19.588 --> 00:22:21.028
I'll help.

00:22:31.788 --> 00:22:32.588
Yan, eat this.

00:22:33.348 --> 00:22:34.149
I think

00:22:34.189 --> 00:22:35.229
it's your favorite.

00:22:35.669 --> 00:22:36.389
Have a few more.

00:22:40.989 --> 00:22:41.508
Yan.

00:22:41.989 --> 00:22:43.696
Congratulations
on winning the competition.

00:22:43.989 --> 00:22:44.748
Haoming

00:22:44.748 --> 00:22:46.108
has been happy for you about this.

00:22:47.189 --> 00:22:47.828
Right, Haoming?

00:22:49.748 --> 00:22:50.189
Yes.

00:22:50.548 --> 00:22:52.308
Actually, Haoming has helped me a lot,

00:22:53.308 --> 00:22:54.709
so I should thank him.

00:22:58.389 --> 00:22:59.229
There's something

00:22:59.229 --> 00:23:00.189
I need your help with.

00:23:01.909 --> 00:23:04.028
Haochen has advanced
in his equestrian competition.

00:23:04.229 --> 00:23:05.229
He wants to hold

00:23:05.268 --> 00:23:06.629
a home party.

00:23:07.268 --> 00:23:08.748
You know him best.

00:23:09.108 --> 00:23:10.028
Could you help me

00:23:10.149 --> 00:23:10.949
and plan it out?

00:23:13.828 --> 00:23:14.508
No problem.

00:23:14.989 --> 00:23:15.788
I'll make a plan

00:23:15.909 --> 00:23:17.108
and send you then.

00:23:17.669 --> 00:23:17.909
Mom.

00:23:17.949 --> 00:23:19.068
Ask Haochen

00:23:19.149 --> 00:23:20.068
if he has any ideas,

00:23:20.429 --> 00:23:20.869
okay?

00:23:21.469 --> 00:23:22.788
Why don't you just come home

00:23:22.788 --> 00:23:23.389
and handle it?

00:23:24.028 --> 00:23:25.068
Haochen would be thrilled

00:23:25.068 --> 00:23:25.909
to see you back.

00:23:26.469 --> 00:23:27.588
So is Haoming.

00:23:27.949 --> 00:23:28.429
Right?

00:23:33.268 --> 00:23:34.669
I'll check my schedule.

00:23:36.028 --> 00:23:36.828
It's settled then.

00:23:41.429 --> 00:23:42.588
This is also your favorite.

00:23:44.108 --> 00:23:44.548
Mom.

00:23:45.108 --> 00:23:46.669
I really need to go to work

00:23:46.709 --> 00:23:47.348
today.

00:23:48.828 --> 00:23:50.389
I haven't even freshened up...

00:23:51.669 --> 00:23:52.389
For the files.

00:23:54.909 --> 00:23:55.869
Well...

00:23:55.869 --> 00:23:57.028
take your time.

00:23:57.429 --> 00:23:58.189
I'm leaving.

00:24:00.268 --> 00:24:00.669
Well...

00:24:01.828 --> 00:24:03.068
Haoming, see Yan out.

00:24:03.108 --> 00:24:03.469
No need.

00:24:04.669 --> 00:24:06.429
Stay here and finish your meal.

00:24:06.788 --> 00:24:07.308
Okay.

00:24:08.588 --> 00:24:10.149
What? Just go!

00:24:35.389 --> 00:24:35.949
Hot?

00:24:38.828 --> 00:24:39.429
No.

00:24:41.629 --> 00:24:42.508
Need the AC?

00:24:43.028 --> 00:24:43.588
No.

00:24:43.748 --> 00:24:44.108
Okay.

00:24:51.788 --> 00:24:53.108
Play some music?

00:24:53.989 --> 00:24:54.548
Okay.

00:25:18.189 --> 00:25:19.268
Let's turn it off.

00:25:27.028 --> 00:25:28.308
My mom's always been like this.

00:25:29.268 --> 00:25:30.429
Speaks her mind,

00:25:30.828 --> 00:25:31.788
without caring others.

00:25:32.268 --> 00:25:32.909
Well,

00:25:33.389 --> 00:25:34.189
I think it's nice.

00:25:34.828 --> 00:25:35.909
Be open and honest,

00:25:37.348 --> 00:25:38.588
never hiding feelings.

00:25:55.108 --> 00:25:55.909
- Right, you...
- Right, you...

00:25:58.308 --> 00:25:58.989
You first.

00:26:00.389 --> 00:26:01.989
How's Yan Studio lately?

00:26:04.268 --> 00:26:04.709
Good.

00:26:06.588 --> 00:26:08.028
After the competition,

00:26:09.108 --> 00:26:10.429
our sales are back to normal.

00:26:10.869 --> 00:26:12.348
So our third batch

00:26:12.348 --> 00:26:13.508
is being produced now.

00:26:15.068 --> 00:26:15.989
Great.

00:26:16.629 --> 00:26:17.709
People have

00:26:17.828 --> 00:26:19.308
high recognition for handmade brocade

00:26:19.348 --> 00:26:20.149
right now.

00:26:20.588 --> 00:26:21.469
Then what's

00:26:21.469 --> 00:26:22.429
your next plan?

00:26:24.429 --> 00:26:26.588
I want to develop more projects

00:26:26.828 --> 00:26:29.229
about traditional dyeing techniques.

00:26:29.909 --> 00:26:30.949
For example,

00:26:31.989 --> 00:26:32.709
Shu brocade.

00:26:34.229 --> 00:26:34.828
Heard of it?

00:26:38.068 --> 00:26:39.024
Gambiered Canton gauze,

00:26:39.949 --> 00:26:40.548
grass cloth.

00:26:41.989 --> 00:26:42.669
Moreover,

00:26:42.949 --> 00:26:45.068
I want to create a new series

00:26:45.229 --> 00:26:47.389
about botanical dyeing technique.

00:26:48.189 --> 00:26:49.508
I think it would be unique.

00:26:49.949 --> 00:26:50.629
But this

00:26:50.629 --> 00:26:51.828
requires training.

00:26:52.588 --> 00:26:53.068
Wonderful.

00:26:54.469 --> 00:26:55.909
What did you want to ask me?

00:26:57.108 --> 00:26:58.189
I wanted to ask you

00:26:58.828 --> 00:27:00.909
if your collaboration with Mr. Baraikin

00:27:01.429 --> 00:27:01.909
goes well.

00:27:03.068 --> 00:27:03.869
Very well.

00:27:04.389 --> 00:27:04.869
Also,

00:27:05.709 --> 00:27:06.869
Mrs. Baraikin

00:27:07.348 --> 00:27:08.629
is very concerned about you.

00:27:11.909 --> 00:27:12.429
Right.

00:27:14.748 --> 00:27:16.348
I should properly thank her,

00:27:16.348 --> 00:27:17.348
but I've been too busy.

00:27:20.508 --> 00:27:21.788
Are you free tomorrow evening?

00:27:25.108 --> 00:27:26.268
I'll invite them for dinner.

00:27:29.508 --> 00:27:29.989
Sure.

00:27:30.909 --> 00:27:31.588
I'll treat them.

00:27:31.869 --> 00:27:32.588
No,

00:27:32.669 --> 00:27:33.629
my treat this time.

00:27:34.108 --> 00:27:36.108
Tomorrow at 6 PM.
I'll text you the address.

00:27:37.469 --> 00:27:37.788
Okay.

00:27:40.389 --> 00:27:42.229
I wonder if Mr. Baraikin

00:27:42.308 --> 00:27:44.068
prefers domestic or imported liquor.

00:27:45.028 --> 00:27:46.308
I'll prepare both.

00:27:49.508 --> 00:27:50.508
Are we drinking tomorrow?

00:27:51.788 --> 00:27:52.429
Of course.

00:27:53.189 --> 00:27:53.949
Last time,

00:27:53.949 --> 00:27:54.909
he and I didn't enjoy.

00:27:55.308 --> 00:27:55.989
Let me tell you,

00:27:56.429 --> 00:27:57.548
alcohol is wonderful.

00:27:57.709 --> 00:27:58.548
After drinking,

00:27:58.828 --> 00:28:00.149
it brings us closer

00:28:00.629 --> 00:28:01.348
and builds bond.

00:28:06.308 --> 00:28:07.788
You shouldn't drink tomorrow.

00:28:10.548 --> 00:28:11.429
I can handle it.

00:28:21.788 --> 00:28:22.548
Gas it up.

00:28:25.108 --> 00:28:26.108
I definitely will.

00:28:32.389 --> 00:28:33.588
I mean your car.

00:28:53.028 --> 00:28:53.869
We've confirmed

00:28:53.869 --> 00:28:55.028
the details with the factory.

00:28:55.268 --> 00:28:56.268
They'll prioritize

00:28:56.308 --> 00:28:57.229
producing our line.

00:28:57.548 --> 00:28:58.709
The release date

00:28:58.748 --> 00:28:59.669
can likely be moved up.

00:29:01.588 --> 00:29:02.748
And 30 percent deposit?

00:29:03.828 --> 00:29:05.149
The factory manager

00:29:05.268 --> 00:29:06.548
has changed attitudes.

00:29:06.909 --> 00:29:07.989
Now he's eager to keep us.

00:29:08.828 --> 00:29:09.989
The award changed everything.

00:29:11.268 --> 00:29:12.068
So,

00:29:12.709 --> 00:29:14.108
we need to improve and stay strong.

00:29:14.989 --> 00:29:15.989
Once we are stronger,

00:29:17.308 --> 00:29:18.629
the world smiles at us.

00:29:23.068 --> 00:29:24.469
Monitor the factory closely.

00:29:25.108 --> 00:29:25.588
No problem.

00:29:25.869 --> 00:29:26.909
Let's end here for today.

00:29:27.989 --> 00:29:28.588
Head back early

00:29:28.828 --> 00:29:29.909
- and get some rest.
- Alright.

00:29:30.788 --> 00:29:32.229
I'll review this with you.

00:29:33.149 --> 00:29:33.709
Bye.

00:29:34.548 --> 00:29:35.429
Are you busy tonight?

00:29:36.548 --> 00:29:37.028
Yes.

00:29:41.508 --> 00:29:42.028
Hello.

00:29:43.788 --> 00:29:44.748
Who's the person

00:29:44.748 --> 00:29:45.348
in charge?

00:29:46.028 --> 00:29:46.508
Hello.

00:29:46.989 --> 00:29:47.669
I'm Xu Yan.

00:29:48.189 --> 00:29:49.268
Let me introduce myself.

00:29:50.108 --> 00:29:51.308
I'm Zhang Fengyu,

00:29:51.629 --> 00:29:53.909
Director of the Economic Service Center
of Gubei Town.

00:29:54.189 --> 00:29:55.108
My business card.

00:29:55.588 --> 00:29:56.068
Okay.

00:29:56.348 --> 00:29:57.548
I heard about you won

00:29:57.748 --> 00:29:58.389
the competition

00:29:58.709 --> 00:29:59.588
and came to visit.

00:30:00.348 --> 00:30:01.469
Here to place orders?

00:30:02.788 --> 00:30:03.508
Actually,

00:30:04.028 --> 00:30:05.268
I'm not here to purchase.

00:30:06.108 --> 00:30:07.108
Let me tell you

00:30:07.189 --> 00:30:08.229
the purpose of my visit.

00:30:09.469 --> 00:30:10.788
This is Gubei Town's

00:30:12.268 --> 00:30:12.828
brochure.

00:30:12.909 --> 00:30:13.508
(Gubei Town)
Take a look.

00:30:14.669 --> 00:30:15.788
This is the leaflet

00:30:16.709 --> 00:30:18.229
of our botanical dyeing technique.

00:30:18.389 --> 00:30:18.949
Take a look.

00:30:23.108 --> 00:30:25.748
Gubei Town specializes
in botanical dyeing,

00:30:26.229 --> 00:30:27.548
an intangible cultural heritage.

00:30:28.108 --> 00:30:29.629
We know you've helped promote

00:30:29.629 --> 00:30:31.268
the handmade brocade.

00:30:31.268 --> 00:30:31.909
I wonder

00:30:32.268 --> 00:30:33.548
if you could

00:30:34.068 --> 00:30:35.909
help promote our botanical dyeing.

00:30:37.068 --> 00:30:38.588
We are about

00:30:38.588 --> 00:30:39.508
to develop this series.

00:30:42.669 --> 00:30:43.469
I was right to come!

00:30:44.108 --> 00:30:44.828
Wonderful!

00:30:44.909 --> 00:30:46.229
To be honest,

00:30:46.909 --> 00:30:47.548
for promoting

00:30:47.748 --> 00:30:48.909
Gubei Town's tourism,

00:30:49.308 --> 00:30:49.828
we plan

00:30:50.229 --> 00:30:51.949
to invite influencers

00:30:51.989 --> 00:30:52.788
to come for a tour.

00:30:53.788 --> 00:30:54.469
We want more

00:30:54.469 --> 00:30:55.308
promotional angles.

00:30:55.588 --> 00:30:56.028
But

00:30:57.149 --> 00:30:57.748
I trust you

00:30:58.108 --> 00:30:59.629
on promoting the botanical dyeing.

00:31:01.629 --> 00:31:02.229
Thank you.

00:31:02.909 --> 00:31:04.469
Mr. Zhang, thank you

00:31:05.068 --> 00:31:06.308
for your trust in Yan Studio.

00:31:07.149 --> 00:31:08.588
We're deeply interested in

00:31:09.028 --> 00:31:09.989
the botanical dyeing.

00:31:11.028 --> 00:31:12.308
We'll contact you later

00:31:12.429 --> 00:31:13.389
for the details.

00:31:15.308 --> 00:31:16.869
I need to study more

00:31:16.909 --> 00:31:18.788
about botanical dyeing.

00:31:19.028 --> 00:31:19.429
Ms. Xu.

00:31:20.028 --> 00:31:21.828
We have botanical dyeing workshops.

00:31:22.149 --> 00:31:23.149
Just come.

00:31:23.389 --> 00:31:24.949
I'll arrange hands-on sessions for you.

00:31:25.348 --> 00:31:25.669
Right.

00:31:26.308 --> 00:31:27.268
This is Gubei Town's

00:31:27.548 --> 00:31:28.308
invitation letter.

00:31:28.429 --> 00:31:28.909
Here.

00:31:28.989 --> 00:31:29.348
Okay.

00:31:29.814 --> 00:31:32.816
(Invitation)

00:31:33.389 --> 00:31:34.108
Thank you so much.

00:31:34.548 --> 00:31:35.588
No, thank you so much.

00:31:36.028 --> 00:31:36.788
I'm leaving then.

00:31:37.709 --> 00:31:38.949
- I'll see you out.
- No need.

00:31:38.949 --> 00:31:39.629
Don't bother.

00:31:40.108 --> 00:31:40.828
See you in town.

00:31:42.229 --> 00:31:42.949
- Bye.
- Take care.

00:31:44.629 --> 00:31:46.189
Perfect timing.

00:31:47.268 --> 00:31:48.469
Things go smoothly.

00:31:51.028 --> 00:31:51.389
Right.

00:31:51.869 --> 00:31:52.989
Sort out all the materials

00:31:53.068 --> 00:31:54.229
we collected about

00:31:54.469 --> 00:31:55.149
botanical dyeing,

00:31:55.149 --> 00:31:56.028
and hold a meeting.

00:31:56.348 --> 00:31:56.828
Okay.

00:32:00.348 --> 00:32:00.828
Ms. Xu.

00:32:01.548 --> 00:32:01.949
Let's go.

00:32:02.508 --> 00:32:03.108
Where to?

00:32:03.429 --> 00:32:05.108
An excellent Yunnan cuisine restaurant.

00:32:05.149 --> 00:32:06.189
Let's go try it today.

00:32:08.788 --> 00:32:09.588
I have plans.

00:32:11.068 --> 00:32:11.588
I'm leaving.

00:32:13.709 --> 00:32:14.189
Leaving?

00:32:16.429 --> 00:32:17.669
Then Ms. Qiao, shall we go?

00:32:17.909 --> 00:32:18.588
I have plans too.

00:32:21.588 --> 00:32:21.949
Wait,

00:32:22.508 --> 00:32:23.389
only us have no plans?

00:32:23.748 --> 00:32:24.669
Apparently.

00:32:56.869 --> 00:32:58.149
This place is gorgeous.

00:32:59.669 --> 00:33:00.869
Stunning.

00:33:03.189 --> 00:33:03.669
You're here.

00:33:04.869 --> 00:33:05.548
Nice to meet you.

00:33:06.149 --> 00:33:06.709
Same here.

00:33:06.748 --> 00:33:07.308
Welcome.

00:33:07.308 --> 00:33:08.788
Mr. Shen, we meet again.

00:33:08.909 --> 00:33:09.268
Hello.

00:33:09.709 --> 00:33:10.469
Everything's ready.

00:33:10.869 --> 00:33:11.748
Okay, thanks.

00:33:30.508 --> 00:33:30.989
Thank you.

00:33:53.669 --> 00:33:54.348
Hello.

00:33:54.748 --> 00:33:56.028
In a hurry to go to the banquet?

00:33:56.429 --> 00:33:56.949
Miss Xu.

00:34:09.429 --> 00:34:10.309
What's the matter,

00:34:10.349 --> 00:34:10.869
Steve?

00:34:13.548 --> 00:34:14.349
I want to give you

00:34:14.349 --> 00:34:15.228
a friendly warning.

00:34:15.949 --> 00:34:16.708
No need,

00:34:16.829 --> 00:34:17.188
thanks.

00:34:18.028 --> 00:34:19.108
Don't you want to know

00:34:19.269 --> 00:34:20.309
why Shen Haoming

00:34:20.309 --> 00:34:21.269
invited you here?

00:34:23.829 --> 00:34:24.349
Networking?

00:34:25.269 --> 00:34:26.269
Or acting with him?

00:34:27.708 --> 00:34:28.429
Seems like

00:34:28.548 --> 00:34:29.869
Shen Haoming

00:34:29.909 --> 00:34:30.989
has deceived you.

00:34:31.869 --> 00:34:32.909
Perhaps you don't know

00:34:33.429 --> 00:34:36.188
Baraikin set a three-month
evaluation period for Jinda Group.

00:34:36.909 --> 00:34:38.228
When Yan Studio was in trouble,

00:34:38.548 --> 00:34:39.588
he tried everything

00:34:39.588 --> 00:34:40.588
to help you.

00:34:41.548 --> 00:34:42.548
Have you ever considered

00:34:44.108 --> 00:34:45.628
he did all that

00:34:46.469 --> 00:34:47.668
merely to keep you

00:34:47.949 --> 00:34:49.028
from divorce?

00:34:50.068 --> 00:34:51.068
Everything he did

00:34:51.909 --> 00:34:53.148
was just for business,

00:34:54.188 --> 00:34:54.909
not out of love.

00:34:55.108 --> 00:34:57.068
How long will you stay
in Jingzhou this time?

00:34:57.469 --> 00:34:58.108
Actually,

00:34:58.108 --> 00:34:59.148
I came with my husband.

00:34:59.628 --> 00:35:00.749
He's here to discuss

00:35:00.749 --> 00:35:02.188
a collaboration project.

00:35:02.429 --> 00:35:02.829
Right,

00:35:03.508 --> 00:35:04.228
Haoming's company

00:35:04.309 --> 00:35:05.508
is on our shortlist

00:35:05.508 --> 00:35:06.429
for the collaboration.

00:35:06.548 --> 00:35:07.389
However,

00:35:07.389 --> 00:35:08.469
all companies will face

00:35:08.508 --> 00:35:09.708
a three-month evaluation.

00:35:11.869 --> 00:35:13.188
Then I'll wait

00:35:13.188 --> 00:35:13.749
for good news.

00:35:16.869 --> 00:35:18.789
Shen Haoming said

00:35:19.028 --> 00:35:20.228
to love and support his wife

00:35:20.548 --> 00:35:21.869
in the interview.

00:35:22.228 --> 00:35:23.309
It was genuinely touching.

00:35:23.749 --> 00:35:25.309
If there were a business world Oscar,

00:35:25.588 --> 00:35:26.628
he'd undoubtedly win it.

00:35:27.148 --> 00:35:27.469
Right,

00:35:27.869 --> 00:35:29.309
after Shen Haoming got interviewed,

00:35:29.389 --> 00:35:30.469
Jinda Group's stock

00:35:30.469 --> 00:35:31.588
hit the upper limit twice.

00:35:31.829 --> 00:35:33.068
I think investors

00:35:33.668 --> 00:35:34.829
eagerly want to see

00:35:34.989 --> 00:35:36.429
a loving couple

00:35:36.829 --> 00:35:38.789
supporting each other.

00:35:39.349 --> 00:35:40.429
Mr. Shen has

00:35:40.628 --> 00:35:41.588
helped you,

00:35:41.829 --> 00:35:42.749
caught the attention

00:35:42.749 --> 00:35:43.429
of the Baraikins,

00:35:43.708 --> 00:35:44.588
and profited

00:35:44.628 --> 00:35:45.429
from stock gains.

00:35:46.269 --> 00:35:47.269
A triple victory indeed.

00:35:48.028 --> 00:35:48.949
So impressed.

00:35:49.309 --> 00:35:50.349
As far as I know,

00:35:50.749 --> 00:35:51.909
today's dinner

00:35:52.588 --> 00:35:54.068
aims to convince the Baraikins

00:35:54.068 --> 00:35:55.349
that you two

00:35:55.469 --> 00:35:56.349
are a loving couple.

00:35:59.548 --> 00:36:00.949
He even hired someone

00:36:01.829 --> 00:36:02.789
to take pictures

00:36:02.789 --> 00:36:03.588
of you nearby

00:36:04.188 --> 00:36:05.389
and publish romantic snippets.

00:36:05.508 --> 00:36:06.389
Giving his all out!

00:36:08.108 --> 00:36:09.309
If Shen Haoming

00:36:09.829 --> 00:36:11.469
secures Baraikin's collaboration,

00:36:11.949 --> 00:36:12.869
he'll probably

00:36:12.869 --> 00:36:13.909
enter the board.

00:36:14.188 --> 00:36:15.389
A quadruple victory.

00:36:15.949 --> 00:36:16.668
Are you done?

00:36:17.548 --> 00:36:18.148
Almost.

00:36:19.269 --> 00:36:20.389
I just want to remind you.

00:36:20.869 --> 00:36:21.869
In business,

00:36:22.909 --> 00:36:24.588
always be cautious.

00:37:07.869 --> 00:37:08.548
Mr. Shen,

00:37:09.508 --> 00:37:11.588
the three-month evaluation starts now.

00:37:12.349 --> 00:37:15.028
We hope to partner with Jinda.

00:37:16.389 --> 00:37:17.068
Me too.

00:37:18.028 --> 00:37:19.389
Both Xu Yan and I are thrilled

00:37:19.789 --> 00:37:21.188
to see you again in China.

00:37:22.508 --> 00:37:23.909
How are you two going?

00:37:24.949 --> 00:37:25.749
We've reconciled.

00:37:26.228 --> 00:37:26.989
She'll arrive soon.

00:37:37.789 --> 00:37:40.068
Sorry I'm late.

00:37:40.989 --> 00:37:41.708
Mr. Baraikin.

00:37:42.068 --> 00:37:42.749
Yan.

00:37:42.869 --> 00:37:44.429
We were just mentioning you.

00:37:44.628 --> 00:37:45.429
Long time no see.

00:37:45.429 --> 00:37:45.989
Darling.

00:37:46.188 --> 00:37:47.789
Happy to see you.

00:37:48.949 --> 00:37:50.548
I've been overwhelmed

00:37:50.548 --> 00:37:51.429
with work lately.

00:37:51.708 --> 00:37:52.749
I should've visited you.

00:37:53.148 --> 00:37:53.749
No worries.

00:37:53.989 --> 00:37:55.989
Brought some tea for you
and Mr. Baraikin.

00:37:56.228 --> 00:37:56.749
Thank you.

00:37:56.789 --> 00:37:57.989
You're so kind.

00:37:58.789 --> 00:37:59.588
Let's sit and chat.

00:37:59.949 --> 00:38:00.989
I want to sit

00:38:01.068 --> 00:38:01.628
with Sophia.

00:38:02.148 --> 00:38:03.389
You remembered my real name?

00:38:03.588 --> 00:38:04.508
Why can't I remember?

00:38:06.068 --> 00:38:07.588
You've lost a lot of weight.

00:38:07.708 --> 00:38:08.469
Really?

00:38:10.389 --> 00:38:11.108
Ms. Xu.

00:38:12.068 --> 00:38:12.749
I've heard about

00:38:12.749 --> 00:38:13.989
your company's trouble.

00:38:14.349 --> 00:38:15.628
Fortunately, you went through.

00:38:16.429 --> 00:38:16.949
Yes.

00:38:17.628 --> 00:38:19.068
Thanks to your wife.

00:38:19.349 --> 00:38:20.909
She wore Yan Studio's gown

00:38:21.309 --> 00:38:23.389
and gave us such a strong endorsement.

00:38:23.668 --> 00:38:25.028
So, we have this success now.

00:38:25.228 --> 00:38:25.829
Not really.

00:38:25.829 --> 00:38:27.389
Yan Studio's designs are exceptional.

00:38:30.068 --> 00:38:31.869
I saw Mr. Shen's interview too.

00:38:32.228 --> 00:38:33.548
His vision and integrity

00:38:33.588 --> 00:38:34.869
truly impress me.

00:38:36.789 --> 00:38:39.548
Men like us in business circles

00:38:39.789 --> 00:38:41.548
may dominate the outside world,

00:38:42.309 --> 00:38:43.869
and many cherish their wives.

00:38:44.269 --> 00:38:46.349
But to be like Mr. Shen,

00:38:46.949 --> 00:38:48.548
who admits his wife outshines him,

00:38:49.108 --> 00:38:49.949
that's truly rare.

00:38:51.269 --> 00:38:51.749
Thank you.

00:38:52.829 --> 00:38:53.588
Indeed.

00:38:53.708 --> 00:38:55.068
Back then, Mr. Shen

00:38:55.108 --> 00:38:57.228
asked me to choose a gown at Yan Studio.

00:38:57.269 --> 00:38:58.108
I knew

00:38:58.228 --> 00:38:59.309
he wanted to help you.

00:38:59.869 --> 00:39:01.309
I told my husband

00:39:01.668 --> 00:39:03.708
that they couldn't be in conflict.

00:39:04.349 --> 00:39:05.429
If you don't love someone

00:39:05.469 --> 00:39:06.628
with sincerity,

00:39:07.188 --> 00:39:07.949
you can't possibly

00:39:07.949 --> 00:39:08.949
be so considerate.

00:39:11.028 --> 00:39:11.668
I'm flattered.

00:39:12.108 --> 00:39:12.989
I should do so.

00:39:13.668 --> 00:39:14.148
Yan.

00:39:14.749 --> 00:39:15.989
Let's have a toast.

00:39:34.148 --> 00:39:35.909
I do need to thank my husband.

00:39:37.668 --> 00:39:39.028
He's been secretly

00:39:39.068 --> 00:39:40.548
doing a lot of things for me.

00:39:41.148 --> 00:39:41.989
And he even

00:39:42.028 --> 00:39:42.989
hid some to me.

00:39:46.829 --> 00:39:47.548
Haoming.

00:39:49.508 --> 00:39:50.228
I toast to you.

00:40:01.829 --> 00:40:02.349
Honey.

00:40:02.668 --> 00:40:04.749
If your collaboration succeeds,

00:40:05.148 --> 00:40:06.068
you must invite them

00:40:06.108 --> 00:40:07.389
to visit our home in Russia.

00:40:07.749 --> 00:40:08.188
Okay?

00:40:08.188 --> 00:40:08.668
Sure.

00:40:09.548 --> 00:40:10.588
You're welcome to come.

00:40:11.349 --> 00:40:12.668
He says you're welcome.

00:40:13.108 --> 00:40:13.628
Thank you.

00:40:14.869 --> 00:40:15.548
Have some more.

00:40:15.749 --> 00:40:16.188
Let's eat.

00:40:21.909 --> 00:40:23.188
Thank you for today.

00:40:23.909 --> 00:40:24.309
Right.

00:40:24.548 --> 00:40:25.148
Don't forget

00:40:25.228 --> 00:40:26.188
to order my gown.

00:40:26.668 --> 00:40:27.508
Don't worry.

00:40:27.588 --> 00:40:29.269
We'll have it custom-tailored.

00:40:29.749 --> 00:40:30.789
But it might take...

00:40:30.869 --> 00:40:31.829
Let's meet

00:40:31.949 --> 00:40:32.829
at the conference.

00:40:33.269 --> 00:40:34.228
Looking forward to it.

00:40:34.349 --> 00:40:35.309
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

00:40:36.708 --> 00:40:37.708
Goodbye, Mr. Baraikin.

00:40:37.749 --> 00:40:38.108
Goodbye.

00:40:39.508 --> 00:40:39.869
Okay.

00:40:43.148 --> 00:40:44.028
Goodbye.

00:40:44.349 --> 00:40:44.789
Goodbye.

00:40:46.469 --> 00:40:46.989
Goodbye.

00:40:50.028 --> 00:40:51.148
The wine tonight was good.

00:40:51.269 --> 00:40:51.829
Yes.

00:40:58.148 --> 00:40:58.989
I'm going back.

00:41:00.028 --> 00:41:00.548
Yan.

00:41:00.909 --> 00:41:02.588
I've finished the acting.

00:41:03.228 --> 00:41:04.148
Let me explain.

00:41:04.389 --> 00:41:05.148
Mr. Baraikin

00:41:05.148 --> 00:41:06.108
gave Jinda Group

00:41:06.148 --> 00:41:07.429
a three-month evaluation period?

00:41:13.668 --> 00:41:14.869
Don't explain to me.

00:41:17.829 --> 00:41:18.989
You did help me,

00:41:21.429 --> 00:41:22.429
but you also achieved

00:41:22.829 --> 00:41:23.668
your own purpose.

00:41:26.989 --> 00:41:28.628
To secure this collaboration,

00:41:29.349 --> 00:41:30.789
you skillfully used

00:41:30.829 --> 00:41:32.068
those around you.

00:41:32.749 --> 00:41:33.749
Typical of you.

00:41:35.349 --> 00:41:36.749
You haven't changed.

00:41:39.668 --> 00:41:40.469
But now you can

00:41:40.469 --> 00:41:41.349
finally relax.

00:41:43.148 --> 00:41:43.668
Fine.

00:41:44.708 --> 00:41:45.389
I admit it.

00:41:46.949 --> 00:41:48.349
I had Mrs. Baraikin

00:41:48.389 --> 00:41:49.668
wearing a gown from Yan Studio

00:41:50.309 --> 00:41:51.668
and had that interview,

00:41:52.068 --> 00:41:54.269
just to impress Mr. Baraikin.

00:41:54.628 --> 00:41:55.749
But I invited you here

00:41:55.789 --> 00:41:57.028
not to put on an act.

00:41:59.708 --> 00:42:00.668
Yet Mr. Baraikin

00:42:00.708 --> 00:42:01.429
still saw

00:42:01.508 --> 00:42:03.429
what you wanted him to see, right?

00:42:03.829 --> 00:42:04.668
What?

00:42:05.869 --> 00:42:06.749
Do you mean everything

00:42:06.749 --> 00:42:07.508
between us

00:42:07.708 --> 00:42:08.588
during this period

00:42:08.588 --> 00:42:09.469
was all fake?

00:42:13.389 --> 00:42:14.068
Doesn't matter.

00:42:18.668 --> 00:42:19.469
What matters is

00:42:19.469 --> 00:42:19.989
if we keep

00:42:19.989 --> 00:42:21.188
arguing like this,

00:42:22.909 --> 00:42:23.909
the paparazzo you hired

00:42:23.909 --> 00:42:24.708
might capture

00:42:24.749 --> 00:42:25.588
undesirable photos.

00:42:34.429 --> 00:42:35.628
Chen Lin, come here.

00:42:47.429 --> 00:42:47.989
Mr. Shen.

00:42:48.389 --> 00:42:48.909
Yan.

00:42:49.588 --> 00:42:50.349
I've deleted

00:42:50.708 --> 00:42:51.588
all his photos.

00:42:52.349 --> 00:42:53.429
I didn't mean

00:42:53.469 --> 00:42:54.749
to take photos of you.

00:42:55.789 --> 00:42:56.708
Take him away.

00:42:58.989 --> 00:42:59.349
Come on.

00:43:03.469 --> 00:43:04.628
That guy was sneaking around.

00:43:04.668 --> 00:43:05.989
I wondered what he was doing.

00:43:09.469 --> 00:43:10.548
Am I that stupid

00:43:11.749 --> 00:43:13.588
to hire such an amateur
for sneak photos?

00:43:14.108 --> 00:43:15.269
Chen Lin is better.

00:43:19.548 --> 00:43:20.148
I understand.

00:43:21.068 --> 00:43:22.668
The collaboration with Mr. Baraikin

00:43:22.749 --> 00:43:24.309
is crucial for Jinda Group.

00:43:25.909 --> 00:43:27.389
But someone's exploiting

00:43:27.429 --> 00:43:28.548
our relationship

00:43:29.508 --> 00:43:30.909
to sabotage your overseas market.

00:43:32.949 --> 00:43:34.309
Someone's targeting me?

00:43:35.148 --> 00:43:35.949
That Steve guy

00:43:38.228 --> 00:43:39.588
has approached me multiple times.

00:43:41.148 --> 00:43:41.749
I know.

00:43:42.349 --> 00:43:43.469
His backing company

00:43:43.469 --> 00:43:44.389
is Situo Company,

00:43:44.749 --> 00:43:46.028
with a shady background.

00:43:47.749 --> 00:43:49.228
He's just their frontman puppet.

00:43:49.228 --> 00:43:50.789
But I don't know

00:43:50.789 --> 00:43:51.909
who's truly behind it.

00:43:57.309 --> 00:43:59.068
That's not my concern,

00:43:59.068 --> 00:43:59.789
but yours.

00:44:01.789 --> 00:44:02.949
I've repaid your favor.

00:44:04.749 --> 00:44:06.068
Wish you go smoothly

00:44:06.068 --> 00:44:06.749
in business.

00:44:07.949 --> 00:44:09.068
When did I ever ask you

00:44:09.068 --> 00:44:09.829
to repay my favor?

00:44:09.829 --> 00:44:10.789
Am I that kind of man?

00:44:10.789 --> 00:44:11.548
I'd like to know

00:44:11.548 --> 00:44:12.869
who exactly you are.

00:44:18.588 --> 00:44:20.188
But I never figured it out.

00:44:24.588 --> 00:44:25.909
Now I finally understand.

00:44:31.829 --> 00:44:32.909
If you want to help me,

00:44:33.789 --> 00:44:35.148
I'll accept it graciously.

00:44:36.869 --> 00:44:38.309
We're adults after all.

00:44:38.708 --> 00:44:40.628
It's quite normal
to go after mutual benefit.

00:44:42.108 --> 00:44:43.469
As for you and I,

00:44:44.429 --> 00:44:46.269
let's just take what we need.

00:44:51.668 --> 00:44:53.068
We can still be friends.

00:44:55.909 --> 00:44:56.389
Take care.
