00:00:06.514 --> 00:00:09.014
Pure has had someone else already.

00:00:09.014 --> 00:00:10.414
Do you know that person?

00:00:10.414 --> 00:00:12.213
It’s not that important.

00:00:12.213 --> 00:00:13.213
I couldn’t make it in time,

00:00:13.213 --> 00:00:15.014
and that’s the point.

00:00:15.014 --> 00:00:16.014
Are you doing good?

00:00:16.014 --> 00:00:17.014
After this,

00:00:17.014 --> 00:00:18.314
what’s our relationship like?

00:00:18.314 --> 00:00:19.713
We’re lovers.

00:00:19.713 --> 00:00:20.314
Oops!

00:00:20.314 --> 00:00:23.014
It’s really like a dream.

00:00:25.014 --> 00:00:27.614
She’s arriving here tomorrow.

00:00:27.614 --> 00:00:30.713
Will you want to go back to Bangkok first?

00:00:30.713 --> 00:00:32.114
Or will you change your mind?

00:00:35.813 --> 00:00:39.913
Pure!

00:00:39.913 --> 00:00:41.614
Air, please calm down.

00:00:41.614 --> 00:00:43.313
Pure’s too drunk now.

00:00:43.313 --> 00:00:45.913
Can you please understand her?

00:00:45.913 --> 00:00:48.614
If you’ve chosen that person,

00:00:48.614 --> 00:00:51.014
why are you here for?

00:00:51.014 --> 00:00:52.714
Because…

00:00:52.714 --> 00:00:55.014
Because what? Say it!

00:00:55.014 --> 00:00:57.813
Do you still love me?

00:00:57.813 --> 00:01:00.313
You love me, really? You can’t even surprise me with my birthday,

00:01:00.313 --> 00:01:01.514
you can’t hug me,

00:01:01.514 --> 00:01:03.214
you can’t say you love me.

00:01:03.214 --> 00:01:06.014
Have you ever thought about my feelings?

00:01:06.014 --> 00:01:08.214
I love you the most and only

00:01:08.214 --> 00:01:10.313
as always.

00:01:10.313 --> 00:01:11.813
Air!

00:01:11.813 --> 00:01:13.214
Air!

00:01:13.214 --> 00:01:16.014
Air!

00:02:29.514 --> 00:02:31.514
Loft,

00:02:31.514 --> 00:02:33.014
I’m on my way.

00:03:24.514 --> 00:03:26.014
Pure,

00:03:45.014 --> 00:03:46.814
are you sure with this?

00:03:49.814 --> 00:03:51.514
Won’t you change your mind?

00:03:58.514 --> 00:04:01.014
If I don’t do it,

00:04:02.514 --> 00:04:05.514
you’ll be sad, right?

00:04:10.514 --> 00:04:15.014
I just wanted to do the right thing.

00:04:15.014 --> 00:04:17.514
But I understand you, anyway.

00:04:17.514 --> 00:04:21.514
If you think it’s too early to …

00:04:24.014 --> 00:04:30.014
I’ve made a decision.

00:04:30.014 --> 00:04:32.514
Let’s do something

00:04:32.514 --> 00:04:35.014
we won’t regret it later.

00:05:52.014 --> 00:05:54.514
So, please check if the other 2 rooms over there

00:05:54.514 --> 00:05:55.514
are available or not.

00:05:55.514 --> 00:05:56.713
Also, for the other 3 rooms over there,

00:05:56.713 --> 00:05:58.514
we need to inspect the electricity system.

00:05:58.514 --> 00:06:01.014
The pool should be fine now.

00:06:01.014 --> 00:06:02.514
Loft,

00:06:02.514 --> 00:06:04.014
I’m on my way.

00:06:45.014 --> 00:06:46.514
When did this start?

00:07:20.135 --> 00:07:25.434
When did this start?

00:07:25.434 --> 00:07:26.635
Pure,

00:07:26.635 --> 00:07:29.835
say something!

00:07:29.835 --> 00:07:31.934
Shortly after the day

00:07:31.934 --> 00:07:33.335
you first introduced me

00:07:33.335 --> 00:07:37.135
to Loft.

00:07:40.135 --> 00:07:42.034
I had fallen for her

00:07:42.034 --> 00:07:43.235
before I knew
11
she was your ex-girlfriend.

00:07:49.434 --> 00:07:51.835
It’s all my fault.

00:07:51.835 --> 00:07:55.434
It’s me who started this.

00:07:55.434 --> 00:07:59.135
After knowing everything,

00:07:59.135 --> 00:08:02.934
why didn’t you stop?

00:08:02.934 --> 00:08:05.335
I’m sorry.

00:08:05.335 --> 00:08:07.635
I’m really sorry.

00:08:11.535 --> 00:08:14.835
Have you ever thought about my feelings?

00:08:14.835 --> 00:08:15.835
Yes,

00:08:15.835 --> 00:08:19.434
I’ve been thinking about it.

00:08:19.434 --> 00:08:21.635
But why didn’t you stop it?

00:08:26.135 --> 00:08:30.135
Stop loving someone like Pure isn’t easy,

00:08:30.135 --> 00:08:34.635
and you know it well.

00:08:34.635 --> 00:08:37.635
Can you tell me

00:08:39.434 --> 00:08:43.434
whether it’s easy?

00:08:51.434 --> 00:08:53.934
Well,

00:08:53.934 --> 00:08:57.335
are you really happy?

00:08:57.335 --> 00:08:59.434
If you’re angry at me,

00:08:59.434 --> 00:09:02.435
you can curse me!

00:09:02.435 --> 00:09:03.535
I know well

00:09:03.535 --> 00:09:06.234
how you’re feeling now.

00:09:06.234 --> 00:09:08.334
I’m sorry

00:09:08.334 --> 00:09:09.935
for the very complicated situation

00:09:09.935 --> 00:09:12.334
which we can’t find a solution.

00:09:12.334 --> 00:09:14.334
In the past,

00:09:14.334 --> 00:09:15.935
you might stop loving me,

00:09:15.935 --> 00:09:17.935
you might not want to wait,

00:09:17.935 --> 00:09:20.334
and I’ve never blamed anyone

00:09:20.334 --> 00:09:22.435
except myself.

00:09:22.435 --> 00:09:24.935
It’s my fault

00:09:24.935 --> 00:09:27.435
that I didn’t choose you.

00:09:27.435 --> 00:09:29.935
It’s my fault

00:09:29.935 --> 00:09:33.435
that I’ve destroyed everything.

00:09:33.435 --> 00:09:35.435
It’s my fault

00:09:35.435 --> 00:09:36.834
that I’ve left you behind

00:09:36.834 --> 00:09:38.135
and let you’ve been feeling sad and disappointed

00:09:38.135 --> 00:09:40.935
for too long.

00:09:40.935 --> 00:09:43.935
But this is Loft.

00:09:43.935 --> 00:09:46.435
Loft, whom you know well

00:09:46.435 --> 00:09:50.935
who she is.

00:09:50.935 --> 00:09:53.935
Does it make sense?

00:09:53.935 --> 00:09:55.935
Can’t it be someone else?

00:09:55.935 --> 00:09:58.435
If it wasn’t Loft,

00:09:58.435 --> 00:10:01.435
I’d wait for you

00:10:01.435 --> 00:10:03.435
without moving on.

00:10:03.435 --> 00:10:04.535
And I didn’t know

00:10:04.535 --> 00:10:05.935
how long I would have to wait for you.

00:10:05.935 --> 00:10:08.935
Do you know what I mean?

00:10:10.935 --> 00:10:14.635
Air!

00:10:14.635 --> 00:10:18.435
What about the promise you gave me?

00:10:18.435 --> 00:10:21.935
Why didn’t you choose me?

00:10:21.935 --> 00:10:23.035
If I had been able to choose,

00:10:23.035 --> 00:10:26.935
I would have chosen you.

00:10:30.935 --> 00:10:33.435
Loft!

00:10:33.435 --> 00:10:36.135
It must be Pure, really?

00:10:39.935 --> 00:10:41.435
I’d never felt like this

00:10:41.435 --> 00:10:43.935
before I met her.

00:10:43.935 --> 00:10:45.935
Never.

00:10:45.935 --> 00:10:48.635
I’m always so happy

00:10:48.635 --> 00:10:51.435
when I’m with her

00:10:51.435 --> 00:10:52.435
that I

00:10:52.435 --> 00:10:56.935
forgot everything.

00:10:56.935 --> 00:10:59.935
Air!

00:10:59.935 --> 00:11:00.935
Also,

00:11:00.935 --> 00:11:02.234
forgetting my feelings,

00:11:02.234 --> 00:11:02.935
right, Loft?

00:11:02.935 --> 00:11:05.635
Air!

00:11:12.635 --> 00:11:13.534
If you guys are this happy,

00:11:13.534 --> 00:11:17.635
enjoy it!

00:11:17.635 --> 00:11:19.935
Pure!

00:11:19.935 --> 00:11:22.435
About us,

00:11:22.435 --> 00:11:24.034
it’s been over since the day

00:11:24.034 --> 00:11:25.435
you told me you had someone else to replace me.

00:11:25.435 --> 00:11:28.435
I’m sorry.

00:11:33.435 --> 00:11:35.435
Don’t cry.

00:11:35.435 --> 00:11:39.635
And don’t feel guilty too long.
87
I’m sorry

00:11:41.435 --> 00:11:44.635
that I’ve hurt you.

00:11:44.635 --> 00:11:46.235
But I don’t want to

00:11:46.235 --> 00:11:47.435
hurt Loft either.

00:11:47.435 --> 00:11:52.635
Hurting me instead

00:11:52.635 --> 00:11:55.935
is much easier, right?

00:12:01.935 --> 00:12:04.435
Loft,

00:12:04.435 --> 00:12:05.935
after this,

00:12:05.935 --> 00:12:07.935
we can only be strangers.

00:12:07.935 --> 00:12:10.135
No. Please don’t say that.

00:12:10.135 --> 00:12:11.834
I can’t be your sister anymore.

00:12:11.834 --> 00:12:15.935
No. Please, Air.

00:12:15.935 --> 00:12:19.435
I’m sorry

00:12:19.435 --> 00:12:20.935
that I can’t stand

00:12:20.935 --> 00:12:21.935
enjoying your love.

00:12:27.935 --> 00:12:29.435
The guilty feeling

00:12:29.435 --> 00:12:31.235
that you both must be responsible for

00:12:31.235 --> 00:12:32.935
as well as

00:12:34.935 --> 00:12:37.435
anger and sadness

00:12:37.435 --> 00:12:40.435
of mine will slightly fade

00:12:40.435 --> 00:12:46.935
one day.

00:12:46.935 --> 00:12:53.435
You’d better enjoy loving each other

00:12:53.435 --> 00:12:57.935
as you’ve chosen it already.

00:12:57.935 --> 00:13:02.635
I can’t do anything.

00:13:02.635 --> 00:13:04.435
Air!

00:14:04.435 --> 00:14:08.435
Happy Birthday!

00:14:08.435 --> 00:14:12.435
Ba-dum!

00:14:12.435 --> 00:14:13.935
Ready?

00:14:13.935 --> 00:14:16.435
Yes, freshly baked.

00:14:16.435 --> 00:14:18.435
Uh.

00:14:18.435 --> 00:14:19.935
Pure&Air.

00:14:19.935 --> 00:14:21.334
Someone said this when we first met,

00:14:21.334 --> 00:14:23.435
right?

00:14:23.435 --> 00:14:25.435
It’s pure air, right?

00:14:25.435 --> 00:14:27.435
Which color is good for me?

00:14:27.435 --> 00:14:28.935
This one.
124
Let me put it on you.

00:14:33.935 --> 00:14:36.935
This color really looks good on you.

00:14:39.935 --> 00:14:41.435
You too.

00:14:41.435 --> 00:14:42.935
Uh.

00:14:46.935 --> 00:14:48.935
I love you.

00:14:49.935 --> 00:14:52.935
I’ll always love you.

00:14:54.935 --> 00:14:56.435
Please

00:14:56.435 --> 00:14:58.435
love me like this

00:14:58.435 --> 00:15:00.935
forever.

00:15:00.935 --> 00:15:01.935
Oh!

00:15:01.935 --> 00:15:03.435
No need to ask me to do so.

00:15:03.435 --> 00:15:05.935
It’s always true.

00:15:12.935 --> 00:15:13.935
It’s dirty here.

00:15:13.935 --> 00:15:15.934
Here as well.

00:15:48.934 --> 00:15:50.434
I love you

00:15:50.434 --> 00:15:54.434
as if you were my sister sibling.

00:16:15.434 --> 00:16:17.635
Who are you here with?

00:16:44.635 --> 00:16:46.934
Air might be here

00:16:46.934 --> 00:16:49.934
before meeting us.

00:16:49.934 --> 00:16:52.934
What should we do after this?

00:18:21.375 --> 00:18:23.476
Air might be here

00:18:23.476 --> 00:18:26.575
before meeting us.

00:18:31.575 --> 00:18:35.075
Tonight, I’ll go back to my place

00:18:35.075 --> 00:18:37.176
if you don’t feel well.

00:18:42.176 --> 00:18:44.575
Please stay here with me tonight.

00:18:51.575 --> 00:18:57.776
What should we do next?

00:18:57.776 --> 00:19:01.976
Choose what we won’t regret later,

00:19:01.976 --> 00:19:03.776
right?

00:19:15.076 --> 00:19:19.076
But does it really exist?

00:19:19.076 --> 00:19:21.776
The way that no one regrets.

00:19:21.776 --> 00:19:24.776
Will you be resistant to the guilty feeling?

00:19:39.776 --> 00:19:44.676
I’m also in pain either

00:19:44.676 --> 00:19:48.776
when seeing you like this.

00:19:57.176 --> 00:20:03.776
Therefore,

00:20:03.776 --> 00:20:07.375
shall we stop

00:20:14.375 --> 00:20:15.375
our relationship?

00:20:22.776 --> 00:20:24.476
I’m sorry.

00:20:30.076 --> 00:20:34.975
You don’t have to say it.

00:20:34.975 --> 00:20:37.375
It’s me who must apologize to you.

00:20:37.375 --> 00:20:38.776
I’ve to be responsible for every loss

00:20:38.776 --> 00:20:42.276
and terrible matter.

00:20:42.276 --> 00:20:44.276
It’s my fault.

00:20:47.475 --> 00:20:48.576
This might be the punishment

00:20:48.576 --> 00:20:52.176
for us.

00:20:52.176 --> 00:20:53.276
How can we become happy

00:20:53.276 --> 00:20:57.076
when someone’s sad because of us.

00:20:57.076 --> 00:21:00.975
We are no longer living together.

00:21:00.975 --> 00:21:06.176
I want you to know that

00:21:06.176 --> 00:21:08.776
I love you so much.

00:21:15.276 --> 00:21:20.276
So do I.

00:21:20.276 --> 00:21:23.975
Can you hear me?

00:21:23.975 --> 00:21:29.076
I love you so much.

00:21:29.076 --> 00:21:33.776
I love you too.

00:24:00.475 --> 00:24:01.776
Loft!

00:25:17.376 --> 00:25:19.776
Pure…

00:25:19.776 --> 00:25:22.076
It seems like

00:25:22.076 --> 00:25:24.975
our ride has come to a stop.

00:25:24.975 --> 00:25:26.776
I never thought I’d ever say this, but …

00:25:31.776 --> 00:25:37.776
I’m glad to have known you.

00:25:48.776 --> 00:25:50.776
I was lucky enough

00:25:50.776 --> 00:25:52.175
to have shared it

00:25:52.175 --> 00:25:52.776
with you.

00:26:13.675 --> 00:26:15.175
But if faith is kind,

00:26:15.175 --> 00:26:18.776
maybe one day

00:26:18.776 --> 00:26:20.776
our path will cross again.

00:26:26.675 --> 00:26:28.175
The love

00:26:28.175 --> 00:26:32.075
I spent my whole life searching for

00:26:32.075 --> 00:26:34.776
I’ve found it in you.

00:26:39.276 --> 00:26:41.776
Thank you for loving me.

00:27:37.376 --> 00:27:39.175
Everything that happened

00:27:39.175 --> 00:27:41.776
I hope

00:27:41.776 --> 00:27:43.276
someday, somehow,

00:27:43.276 --> 00:27:45.575
you’ll find a love that you truly deserve.

00:27:45.575 --> 00:27:46.675
A love

00:27:46.675 --> 00:27:50.276
that won’t cause any pain to anyone ever again.

00:27:50.276 --> 00:27:52.776
I’ll always love you, Pure.

00:28:10.976 --> 00:28:12.476
A relationship

00:28:12.476 --> 00:28:14.175
that slowly lifts us

00:28:14.175 --> 00:28:15.276
the highest

00:28:15.276 --> 00:28:16.776
without us even realizing

00:28:23.376 --> 00:28:25.776
and in just a fleeting moment,

00:28:25.776 --> 00:28:26.675
it lets us

00:28:26.675 --> 00:28:28.175
fall,

00:28:28.175 --> 00:28:31.075
unprepared, into the emptiness below.

00:28:31.075 --> 00:28:33.376
Do you really like being directed, hah?

00:28:33.376 --> 00:28:35.175
The speed

00:28:35.175 --> 00:28:40.075
that once made my heart race,

00:28:40.075 --> 00:28:42.476
that made me scream

00:28:42.476 --> 00:28:43.376
to release

00:28:43.376 --> 00:28:45.776
the overflowing feelings inside

00:28:47.976 --> 00:28:49.175
when it all comes

00:28:49.175 --> 00:28:51.776
to an end,

00:28:51.776 --> 00:28:54.776
when I unbuckle the seatbelt

00:28:54.776 --> 00:28:57.976
and step off the ride,

00:28:57.976 --> 00:29:00.976
all that’s left is discomfort,

00:29:00.976 --> 00:29:02.776
the nausea,

00:29:02.776 --> 00:29:05.776
the dizziness,

00:29:05.776 --> 00:29:09.075
and the unbearable torment

00:29:09.075 --> 00:29:11.776
that we can no longer endure it.

00:29:17.175 --> 00:29:18.776
It leaves me scared, frightened,

00:29:18.776 --> 00:29:21.776
and unwilling to ever go through it again.

00:29:24.976 --> 00:29:26.175
Thrilling like

00:29:26.175 --> 00:29:27.776
riding a roller coaster

00:29:27.776 --> 00:29:29.175
that’s what it was.

00:29:54.276 --> 00:29:55.276
What happened?

00:29:55.276 --> 00:29:56.276
You look as if you saw a ghost.

00:29:56.276 --> 00:29:57.075
What?!

00:29:57.075 --> 00:29:58.776
It’s more than what you could imagine!

00:29:58.776 --> 00:29:59.776
Why?!

00:29:59.776 --> 00:30:00.476
What?!

00:30:00.476 --> 00:30:01.276
Damn it!

00:30:01.276 --> 00:30:01.776
What?!

00:30:30.477 --> 00:30:30.977
Can you remember

00:30:30.977 --> 00:30:34.477
when I was terribly sad that time?

00:30:34.477 --> 00:30:35.777
And I got this from that period.

00:30:35.777 --> 00:30:36.977
OIC. That is

00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:39.977
being twisted according to sensitive emotions.

00:30:39.977 --> 00:30:40.777
Yes.

00:30:40.777 --> 00:30:41.977
It’s like infinity.

00:30:42.277 --> 00:30:43.477
Alright. Let’s see some others.

00:30:43.477 --> 00:30:44.477
What about this?

00:30:44.477 --> 00:30:45.977
What’s it?

00:30:45.977 --> 00:30:48.477
This is what I co-worked with Mr. Kham.

00:30:48.477 --> 00:30:49.477
OIC.

00:30:49.477 --> 00:30:51.477
I first saw this

00:30:51.477 --> 00:30:53.177
in Petchaburi.

00:30:53.177 --> 00:30:54.276
And I really

00:30:54.776 --> 00:30:55.977
like it so much

00:30:55.977 --> 00:30:57.477
that I later asked Mr. Kham to collaborate with me.

00:31:01.477 --> 00:31:02.776
Milk and Love

00:31:02.776 --> 00:31:03.477
are my friends.

00:31:03.477 --> 00:31:04.477
Hello, everyone.

00:31:04.477 --> 00:31:05.776
Your work is so good.

00:31:05.776 --> 00:31:07.376
Normally, you’re based in Petchaburi, right?

00:31:07.376 --> 00:31:07.876
Yes, I am.

00:31:07.876 --> 00:31:09.776
I’m always there.

00:31:09.777 --> 00:31:09.977
Alright.

00:31:09.978 --> 00:31:11.977
I love it. It’s amazing.

00:31:11.977 --> 00:31:12.977
Thank you.

00:31:12.977 --> 00:31:13.677
Well,

00:31:13.677 --> 00:31:15.477
that I’ve been working with him.

00:31:17.276 --> 00:31:17.977
Oh!

00:31:17.977 --> 00:31:19.977
Hello, girls!

00:31:19.977 --> 00:31:22.477
This flower bouquet is for you. Congratulations.

00:31:22.477 --> 00:31:24.177
Thank you.

00:31:24.177 --> 00:31:25.477
You’re awesome!

00:31:25.477 --> 00:31:27.377
I’m so proud of you.

00:31:27.377 --> 00:31:28.477
Thank you.

00:31:31.177 --> 00:31:32.977
Congratulations, my love.

00:31:32.977 --> 00:31:35.776
Thank you, Mom.

00:31:35.776 --> 00:31:36.776
Dad and Mom,

00:31:36.776 --> 00:31:38.477
this is Mr. Kham.

00:31:38.477 --> 00:31:39.477
Oh. Hello.

00:31:39.477 --> 00:31:40.477
I used to tell you about him.

00:31:40.477 --> 00:31:41.477
Hello.

00:31:41.477 --> 00:31:42.977
Your work is so amazing.

00:31:42.977 --> 00:31:43.776
Thank you.

00:31:43.776 --> 00:31:45.477
I’d like to ask about your inspiration, really.

00:31:45.477 --> 00:31:47.177
It’s wonderful.

00:31:47.177 --> 00:31:48.276
Shall you go upstairs for more works?

00:31:48.276 --> 00:31:48.577
Oh.

00:31:48.578 --> 00:31:49.477
Please come this way.

00:31:49.477 --> 00:31:50.977
Of course.

00:31:50.977 --> 00:31:52.977
Please take care of them, Tem.

00:31:52.977 --> 00:31:55.477
Congrats, my brilliant girl.

00:31:55.477 --> 00:31:56.477
Thank you.

00:31:56.477 --> 00:31:57.977
So good.

00:31:57.977 --> 00:31:59.477
How are you? Are you tired?

00:31:59.477 --> 00:32:00.477
Sure, I am.

00:32:00.477 --> 00:32:01.977
WTF!

00:32:01.977 --> 00:32:02.477
What?!

00:32:02.477 --> 00:32:04.977
You look as if you saw a ghost?

00:32:04.977 --> 00:32:05.977
What?!

00:32:08.477 --> 00:32:08.977
What do you mean?

00:32:08.977 --> 00:32:09.977
Damn it!

00:32:09.977 --> 00:32:11.477
What?!

00:32:11.477 --> 00:32:12.477
What?!

00:32:31.977 --> 00:32:34.677
This is from Air.

00:32:37.277 --> 00:32:38.977
Thank you.

00:32:45.977 --> 00:32:47.777
I’m sorry

00:32:47.777 --> 00:32:50.777
for everything.

00:32:50.777 --> 00:32:53.477
I’ve been

00:32:53.477 --> 00:32:57.477
messing up your life.

00:32:57.477 --> 00:32:59.977
In fact,

00:32:59.977 --> 00:33:02.977
we’ve never seriously talked to each other before.

00:33:02.977 --> 00:33:07.277
We hardly meet in person.

00:33:07.277 --> 00:33:09.477
I admit that

00:33:09.477 --> 00:33:12.477
I’m really interested

00:33:12.477 --> 00:33:14.977
in knowing

00:33:14.977 --> 00:33:16.977
the reasons

00:33:16.977 --> 00:33:20.477
why they really love you.

00:33:22.477 --> 00:33:26.277
I think it’s just a coincidence.

00:33:28.277 --> 00:33:30.477
For me,

00:33:30.477 --> 00:33:34.477
coincidence doesn’t exist.

00:33:34.477 --> 00:33:35.977
When I interrupted the relationship

00:33:35.977 --> 00:33:39.477
of you and Air.

00:33:39.477 --> 00:33:43.977
Though it was so painful,

00:33:43.977 --> 00:33:46.477
I’ve learned something from it.

00:33:46.477 --> 00:33:51.477
I now know how I should take care of my love.

00:33:51.477 --> 00:33:54.477
Without those days,

00:33:54.477 --> 00:33:56.477
I wouldn’t have understood things easily

00:33:56.477 --> 00:33:58.277
like nowadays.

00:34:01.977 --> 00:34:04.977
Well,

00:34:04.977 --> 00:34:07.977
have you lately known something about Air?

00:34:07.977 --> 00:34:09.477
That she’s been working for

00:34:09.477 --> 00:34:12.477
her friend’s restaurant in France, right?

00:34:12.477 --> 00:34:16.477
I hardly texted her

00:34:16.477 --> 00:34:19.477
but haven’t met her at all.

00:34:19.477 --> 00:34:22.477
For about …

00:34:22.477 --> 00:34:24.477
2 years, I guess.

00:34:31.477 --> 00:34:34.477
She’s just come back to Thailand

00:34:39.477 --> 00:34:41.977
to manage her belongings here

00:34:41.977 --> 00:34:42.977
as she plans to move

00:34:42.977 --> 00:34:47.277
to France, permanently.

00:34:47.277 --> 00:34:49.977
I came visit your exhibition today

00:34:49.977 --> 00:34:52.177
to tell you about this.

00:34:56.477 --> 00:34:59.977
She doesn’t want you to know,

00:34:59.977 --> 00:35:02.477
but I think

00:35:02.477 --> 00:35:04.577
you should know it.

00:35:16.977 --> 00:35:17.977
Oh. You’re still here?

00:35:17.977 --> 00:35:18.977
Right.

00:35:18.977 --> 00:35:21.477
I’m waiting for my kids.

00:35:21.477 --> 00:35:22.977
Are they travelling from Petchaburi?

00:35:22.977 --> 00:35:24.977
Yes. I’ve sent them some photos from here,

00:35:24.977 --> 00:35:26.977
and they are so happy.

00:35:26.977 --> 00:35:27.477
Oh!

00:35:27.477 --> 00:35:29.477
Thank you so much.

00:35:29.477 --> 00:35:30.977
I’m so pleased

00:35:30.977 --> 00:35:32.977
that you had agreed to co-work with me.

00:35:32.977 --> 00:35:34.977
Instead, it must be me who says that.

00:35:34.977 --> 00:35:36.477
If you hadn’t asked me to join you,

00:35:36.477 --> 00:35:37.977
no one would have seen

00:35:37.977 --> 00:35:40.477
such local works of mine.

00:35:40.477 --> 00:35:41.477
Well,

00:35:41.477 --> 00:35:42.477
talking about the painting downstairs,

00:35:42.477 --> 00:35:44.477
won’t you sell it?

00:35:44.477 --> 00:35:45.977
I’ve seen many interested persons

00:35:45.977 --> 00:35:48.677
wanting to buy it.

00:35:51.477 --> 00:35:52.277
Well,

00:35:52.277 --> 00:35:55.977
it’s because I just wanted to have it shown there.

00:35:55.977 --> 00:35:56.977
With the hope that

00:35:56.977 --> 00:35:59.977
the person in the painting would come and see it one day.

00:35:59.977 --> 00:36:02.477
She must be so important to you.

00:36:02.477 --> 00:36:03.277
I guess

00:36:03.277 --> 00:36:04.477
if she comes and sees the painting,

00:36:04.477 --> 00:36:06.477
she’ll certainly be very happy

00:36:06.477 --> 00:36:08.977
that she’s as beautiful

00:36:08.977 --> 00:36:11.977
as art.

00:36:11.977 --> 00:36:15.477
As same as your daughters, right?

00:36:16.977 --> 00:36:17.977
Dad!

00:36:17.977 --> 00:36:18.977
There,

00:36:18.977 --> 00:36:20.477
they are.

00:36:20.477 --> 00:36:21.477
Hello!

00:36:21.477 --> 00:36:22.977
Excuse me.

00:36:22.977 --> 00:36:23.977
I’m showing them around.

00:36:23.977 --> 00:36:25.477
Sure.

00:36:29.977 --> 00:36:31.477
How is it?

00:36:31.477 --> 00:36:32.977
Beautiful.

00:36:32.977 --> 00:36:34.977
They are you guys.

00:36:34.977 --> 00:36:36.477
Let’s go that way!

00:36:36.477 --> 00:37:00.977
Okay.

00:37:00.977 --> 00:37:03.477
This is from Air.

00:37:24.977 --> 00:37:27.977
Can you remember these couple rings?

00:37:27.977 --> 00:37:29.477
The first molding works

00:37:29.477 --> 00:37:32.977
you taught me.

00:37:32.977 --> 00:37:35.477
I want you to keep them

00:37:38.877 --> 00:37:39.977
As the gifts

00:37:39.977 --> 00:37:42.477
for your latest achievement.

00:37:46.977 --> 00:37:49.477
From now on,

00:37:49.477 --> 00:37:51.477
I wish you would be happy

00:37:51.477 --> 00:37:54.477
for what you’ve chosen.
176
When is Air going back to France?

00:37:57.477 --> 00:38:00.477
Tonight.

00:38:18.977 --> 00:38:23.977
We probably won't see each other again for a long time.

00:38:23.977 --> 00:38:26.977
Congratulations.

00:38:35.977 --> 00:38:36.977
Well,

00:38:36.977 --> 00:38:39.477
how’s Loft, anyway?

00:38:39.477 --> 00:38:40.477
I’ve never seen her with the terrible moment

00:38:40.477 --> 00:38:43.477
like that before.

00:38:43.477 --> 00:38:44.977
She hasn’t come to

00:38:44.977 --> 00:38:46.977
the house in Bangkok for more than a year.

00:38:46.977 --> 00:38:48.977
But Loft is a die-hard person.

00:38:48.977 --> 00:38:51.477
She’ll get well soon.

00:39:15.977 --> 00:39:17.977
Thank you.

00:39:21.977 --> 00:39:23.977
Nom nom!

00:39:58.977 --> 00:40:03.477
Oh. Can I have a drinks menu?

00:40:49.477 --> 00:40:50.977
Have you been waiting for long,

00:40:50.977 --> 00:40:52.477
Honey?

00:40:58.977 --> 00:41:00.977
Hello, Pure.

00:41:26.477 --> 00:41:28.977
You look strange.

00:41:28.977 --> 00:41:31.977
Why whispering, huh?

00:41:31.977 --> 00:41:33.477
As a lover,

00:41:33.477 --> 00:41:36.977
am I allowed to do so?

00:41:36.977 --> 00:41:39.477
Sure.

00:41:42.977 --> 00:41:44.977
We’ve been through so many things

00:41:44.977 --> 00:41:51.477
for the past couple of years.

00:41:51.477 --> 00:41:54.477
What?!

00:41:54.477 --> 00:41:55.977
Have you lately

00:41:55.977 --> 00:42:02.477
talked to Air?

00:42:02.477 --> 00:42:06.477
Hardly.

00:42:06.477 --> 00:42:08.477
She calls me

00:42:08.477 --> 00:42:12.477
to update things in general.

00:42:12.477 --> 00:42:14.477
But it’s about

00:42:14.477 --> 00:42:16.477
once a year.

00:42:19.477 --> 00:42:22.977
And,

00:42:22.977 --> 00:42:25.977
she’s doing well.

00:42:25.977 --> 00:42:27.477
She’s so many things

00:42:27.477 --> 00:42:29.977
to do there.

00:42:29.977 --> 00:42:31.977
Also,

00:42:31.977 --> 00:42:34.977
she can do what she wants to do.

00:42:34.977 --> 00:42:38.477
Umm. It’s good to hear that.

00:42:47.477 --> 00:42:49.477
I love you.

00:42:49.477 --> 00:42:52.477
I always love you.

00:42:52.477 --> 00:42:55.477
So do I.

00:43:01.977 --> 00:43:03.477
It’s getting late now.

00:43:03.477 --> 00:43:04.977
We shouldn’t let your parents wait.

00:43:04.977 --> 00:43:07.477
Let’s go back home.

00:43:07.477 --> 00:43:09.477
You don’t have to be in that hurry.

00:43:09.477 --> 00:43:11.477
No one can blame me.

00:43:11.477 --> 00:43:13.477
Go, now! Don’t be slow.

00:43:13.477 --> 00:43:14.477
Okay. Alright.

00:43:14.477 --> 00:43:16.977
I only give up on you.

00:43:21.477 --> 00:43:22.977
I’ve just had my hair styled.

00:43:22.977 --> 00:43:25.477
It’s a mess now.

00:43:25.477 --> 00:43:26.477
That’s too much.
