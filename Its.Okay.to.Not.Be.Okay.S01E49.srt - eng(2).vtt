00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:04.212
You get so defensive
whenever I mention Samuel.

00:00:04.295 --> 00:00:05.755
Just keep being careless,

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:08.049
and eventually,
I'll find out what you're hiding.

00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:10.719
You were destined to be part of my life.

00:00:10.802 --> 00:00:12.554
While I'm by Matmat's side,

00:00:12.637 --> 00:00:14.139
will you stay by mine?

00:00:14.222 --> 00:00:15.932
Make that 100,000 pesos.

00:00:16.016 --> 00:00:18.852
Matmat doesn't have 100,000.

00:00:18.935 --> 00:00:22.147
Pay me, or draw for me.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.983
Patpat is my brother. You won't take him.

00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:27.485
What kind of brother
are you to talk like that?

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:28.862
Hey, Matmat!

00:00:28.945 --> 00:00:30.488
Matmat! Matmat!

00:00:30.572 --> 00:00:31.990
Don't lock the door!

00:01:27.212 --> 00:01:28.838
Your brother is impossible!

00:01:29.589 --> 00:01:32.008
I talked to him nicely,
tried to tug at his conscience,

00:01:32.091 --> 00:01:33.927
bought boxes of chicken barbecue--

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:35.094
You threatened him.

00:01:36.054 --> 00:01:37.013
No, I didn't.

00:01:37.096 --> 00:01:38.264
Really?

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.391
Is that what he said?

00:01:41.184 --> 00:01:42.644
Do I even have to ask him?

00:01:43.102 --> 00:01:44.813
I didn't threaten him, okay?

00:01:44.896 --> 00:01:46.606
I just reminded him of our contract.

00:01:47.023 --> 00:01:48.399
Besides…

00:01:49.734 --> 00:01:51.694
he still didn't give in.

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:54.531
Mia…

00:01:56.241 --> 00:01:58.159
That's just how Matmat is.

00:01:58.952 --> 00:02:00.912
It's hard to get on his good side.

00:02:00.995 --> 00:02:02.831
It even took Jason 10 years to do so.

00:02:03.998 --> 00:02:05.125
Ten years?!

00:02:05.208 --> 00:02:07.418
- Mm-hmm.
- Ten years, to be like that?

00:02:07.502 --> 00:02:11.089
You might take five years
more with the way things are going.

00:02:11.172 --> 00:02:12.215
Patrick.

00:02:17.512 --> 00:02:21.599
What can I do so I don't
have to woo him for ten years?

00:02:24.227 --> 00:02:25.562
Earn his trust.

00:02:26.354 --> 00:02:29.524
Make him feel like
you won't take me away from him.

00:02:29.607 --> 00:02:33.486
- I'm not.
- But that's what he thinks.

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.446
That's what he feels.

00:02:38.074 --> 00:02:40.451
He said that when I gave you Satsat.

00:02:40.535 --> 00:02:42.287
Satsat, whom he considers his brother.

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:43.872
Imagine how he felt
when you ended up with him.

00:02:44.873 --> 00:02:47.250
He's just scared you'll take me too.

00:02:52.255 --> 00:02:57.093
So that's why he keeps
saying I'm not your sister.

00:02:57.719 --> 00:02:58.928
{\an8}Mia.

00:03:02.265 --> 00:03:06.394
{\an8}Just make him feel
like he won't lose a brother.

00:03:07.562 --> 00:03:09.772
{\an8}That, in fact, he'll gain a sister.

00:03:09.856 --> 00:03:12.442
{\an8}

00:03:12.525 --> 00:03:14.527
{\an8}Well, that's one way to say it.

00:03:14.611 --> 00:03:16.779
{\an8}When you convince him you mean no harm,

00:03:17.697 --> 00:03:19.407
{\an8}he'll warm up to you.

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.829
{\an8}But while Matmat
and I aren't living with you,

00:03:25.538 --> 00:03:26.998
{\an8}you'll have to eat on your own.

00:03:27.957 --> 00:03:30.752
{\an8}Make sure the doors and gates are locked.

00:03:30.835 --> 00:03:33.254
{\an8}Don't let strangers in.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.927
{\an8}And let me know
when you leave and arrive home, okay?

00:03:41.804 --> 00:03:42.764
{\an8}Yes, sir.

00:03:42.847 --> 00:03:46.142
{\an8}

00:03:46.226 --> 00:03:47.435
{\an8}Don't worry.

00:03:48.228 --> 00:03:50.188
{\an8}Eventually, you and Matmat will be close.

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.615
{\an8}Let's eat.
We can't let these go to waste.

00:04:00.698 --> 00:04:02.200
{\an8}This is a lot.

00:04:05.912 --> 00:04:06.913
{\an8}Mmm!

00:04:06.996 --> 00:04:08.831
{\an8}-
How many boxes will you eat?

00:04:08.915 --> 00:04:09.916
{\an8}

00:04:13.503 --> 00:04:16.089
{\an8}Doc, Mama Li asked me to give you this.

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:17.840
{\an8}Really?

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.051
{\an8}She can't resist me, can she?

00:04:20.802 --> 00:04:23.054
{\an8}She said you need to make a decision

00:04:23.137 --> 00:04:25.056
{\an8}or she'll stop bringing you food.

00:04:25.431 --> 00:04:28.601
{\an8}Oh, so this is a bribe.
She's pressuring me.

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:36.150
{\an8}

00:04:36.234 --> 00:04:40.196
{\an8}It seems even now, your brother
still can't draw butterflies.

00:04:43.324 --> 00:04:46.327
He hasn't overcome
his fear of butterflies.

00:04:49.455 --> 00:04:51.332
He hates butterflies

00:04:51.416 --> 00:04:55.253
because they remind him of
the day your mother was killed.

00:05:01.175 --> 00:05:04.595
I really want to know
what happened that night.

00:05:06.431 --> 00:05:10.727
It might help Matmat
face his fear of butterflies.

00:05:14.564 --> 00:05:16.149
It's only a matter of time, Patrick.

00:05:19.944 --> 00:05:21.487
You know what, Doc?

00:05:21.571 --> 00:05:25.116
You're the reason
we returned to Maravida.

00:05:25.992 --> 00:05:27.827
- Me?
- Mm-hmm.

00:05:28.619 --> 00:05:32.290
When I read your credentials
and saw that you specialize in PTSD,

00:05:32.373 --> 00:05:34.459
I knew you'd be able to help my brother.

00:05:35.668 --> 00:05:38.796
I'm really touched by
how much you trust me.

00:05:39.213 --> 00:05:40.715
But I'm not that special, Patrick.

00:05:41.591 --> 00:05:42.633
But, you are Doc.

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:47.221
You've used his interest in drawing
as part of his therapy.

00:05:47.305 --> 00:05:49.974
That convinced me that it
was right decision to seek your help.

00:05:50.767 --> 00:05:52.268
Oh, stop it, Patrick.

00:05:52.602 --> 00:05:54.896
I'm trying to lower my blood pressure,

00:05:54.979 --> 00:05:56.773
yet here you are making my heart swell.

00:06:06.282 --> 00:06:07.867
Don't worry.

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:09.702
One day,

00:06:09.786 --> 00:06:13.164
Matmat will be ready to face his fears.

00:06:28.429 --> 00:06:29.931
What's going on?

00:06:30.014 --> 00:06:31.516
It's about Mister Samuel.

00:06:34.977 --> 00:06:38.564
Doc, did Samuel's cancer spread?

00:06:39.148 --> 00:06:41.776
Unfortunately, yes.

00:06:42.401 --> 00:06:44.070
That's what his surgeon told me.

00:06:46.572 --> 00:06:50.326
So should we prepare him
for surgery, Doc.?

00:06:52.245 --> 00:06:53.329
No, Nurse.

00:06:54.622 --> 00:06:57.208
Surgery's no longer advisable.

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:10.805
So we're just letting him be?

00:07:12.723 --> 00:07:14.392
Poor Mister Samuel…

00:07:49.343 --> 00:07:52.054
Okay, nurses. Back to work.

00:08:15.286 --> 00:08:16.287
Gemma!

00:08:16.871 --> 00:08:18.873
Is my prettiest daughter going home?

00:08:19.373 --> 00:08:21.292
Mama, I'm your only daughter.

00:08:21.375 --> 00:08:23.711
Exactly. That makes you the prettiest.

00:08:24.462 --> 00:08:25.838
Are you heading straight home?

00:08:25.922 --> 00:08:27.715
Not yet, Mama. I'm going out.

00:08:27.798 --> 00:08:29.217
Ah… Where to?

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:30.468
For coffee.

00:08:30.551 --> 00:08:34.764
Kids these days!
You really have to go out for coffee?

00:08:34.847 --> 00:08:37.517
You can make tons of drinks at home.

00:08:38.559 --> 00:08:42.605
You're right.
Maybe we'll just have coffee here.

00:08:43.147 --> 00:08:45.107
I'll tell Vincent.

00:08:45.191 --> 00:08:48.069
Vincent? You're having coffee with him?

00:08:48.152 --> 00:08:49.195
Yeah.

00:08:49.278 --> 00:08:51.239
Okay. Then go out!

00:08:51.322 --> 00:08:54.116
And have tea, snacks, dinner…

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:58.454
Even a midnight snack
and breakfast the next day.

00:08:58.538 --> 00:09:00.581
Mama. Mama, calm down.

00:09:00.665 --> 00:09:03.543
And… Wait, wait, wait.

00:09:04.919 --> 00:09:08.297
That's your OOTD?
Not a very good aesthetic.

00:09:08.839 --> 00:09:10.258
Aesthetic?

00:09:10.341 --> 00:09:14.971
Ah! Wait! Look.
This just got delivered today.

00:09:15.054 --> 00:09:17.139
Come on, let me put this on you.

00:09:17.223 --> 00:09:19.892
Mama, didn't you say I'm the prettiest?

00:09:19.976 --> 00:09:21.811
What are you doing?
Is this for aesthetics too?

00:09:21.894 --> 00:09:23.437
No. For Vincent.

00:09:24.021 --> 00:09:26.023
Oh, there you go.

00:09:26.107 --> 00:09:27.316
Thank you, miss.

00:09:28.985 --> 00:09:31.070
Nice, you even put on makeup today.

00:09:32.989 --> 00:09:33.990
What?

00:09:37.326 --> 00:09:38.369
Uh…

00:09:39.704 --> 00:09:42.665
- Is it okay if I ask, about Mia?
- Hmm.

00:09:43.207 --> 00:09:44.208
Hmm. Sure.

00:09:45.793 --> 00:09:47.503
Does she have any other family?

00:09:50.172 --> 00:09:55.553
If she did, you wouldn't be
contacting us about Mister Samuel.

00:09:59.181 --> 00:10:00.391
Fair point.

00:10:00.474 --> 00:10:03.185
Why? Any news about his cancer?

00:10:03.769 --> 00:10:05.563
It's spreading.

00:10:07.398 --> 00:10:09.108
Surgery's no longer an option.

00:10:10.318 --> 00:10:11.652
That's bad news.

00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:14.822
I'll be the one to tell Mia.

00:10:15.406 --> 00:10:16.741
I'll find the right timing,

00:10:16.824 --> 00:10:19.869
that'll make her feel
like caring for her father.

00:10:21.329 --> 00:10:22.413
Thank you.

00:10:23.706 --> 00:10:25.583
What shall we talk about?

00:10:26.083 --> 00:10:28.252
You… or me.

00:10:28.794 --> 00:10:29.712
Us?

00:10:30.421 --> 00:10:32.798
Well, if it's about us, I'd like that.

00:10:32.882 --> 00:10:35.176
But yeah, let's talk about us.

00:10:35.259 --> 00:10:37.720
My life's boring anyway.

00:10:37.803 --> 00:10:39.055
Boring?

00:10:39.472 --> 00:10:41.891
It didn't seem
boring when you were drunk.

00:10:41.974 --> 00:10:43.309
Didn't look boring at all.

00:10:43.893 --> 00:10:44.894
Okay.

00:10:46.812 --> 00:10:50.274
So, ever since my father died…

00:10:50.358 --> 00:10:53.653
Yes! That's what I like.
From the top, with a backstory!

00:10:53.736 --> 00:10:55.655
Go on, after your dad died?

00:10:55.738 --> 00:10:57.907
Ever since my father died

00:10:57.990 --> 00:11:02.078
my uncles got me into drinking, but…

00:11:03.579 --> 00:11:05.081
Mm…

00:11:05.164 --> 00:11:11.128
Matmat will have no
money left after paying Mia.

00:11:11.921 --> 00:11:16.967
All the money will be gone and there will
be nothing left for the camping car.

00:11:25.726 --> 00:11:26.852
Matmat?

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:32.942
How was Jason's Inasal?

00:11:34.026 --> 00:11:35.361
Was it busy?

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:39.782
Jason gave a bonus.

00:11:39.865 --> 00:11:43.244
Lots of orders at the restaurant today.

00:11:44.703 --> 00:11:45.788
Really?

00:11:46.747 --> 00:11:48.332
Lots of customers?

00:11:48.999 --> 00:11:51.460
No, it was just Mia.

00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:55.423
She bought 50 orders

00:11:55.798 --> 00:11:58.634
and sent them to OK Hospital.

00:12:00.177 --> 00:12:02.096
You didn't get to eat?

00:12:04.098 --> 00:12:05.641
Ahh…

00:12:05.724 --> 00:12:08.727
She treated everyone at the hospital.

00:12:10.146 --> 00:12:12.731
Mia has a lot of money.

00:12:13.357 --> 00:12:14.400
She's rich.

00:12:15.943 --> 00:12:18.279
I just know her house is huge.

00:12:18.362 --> 00:12:21.449
You should've asked her earlier.

00:12:22.241 --> 00:12:25.119
She was there. She's so annoying.

00:12:30.332 --> 00:12:32.334
Why? What'd she do?

00:12:38.048 --> 00:12:40.468
She kept distracting Matmat at work.

00:12:52.771 --> 00:12:54.690
- Miss Mia!
- No!

00:12:55.149 --> 00:12:56.442
I… Uh…

00:12:56.525 --> 00:12:59.236
Miss Mia, please.

00:13:01.238 --> 00:13:03.449
Please don't make me go home.

00:13:03.532 --> 00:13:05.993
It's so late.

00:13:06.911 --> 00:13:10.831
- Can I just stay here? Please?
- You and Vincent are just being annoying.

00:13:12.208 --> 00:13:13.501
Oh!

00:13:13.584 --> 00:13:17.588
Miss Mia,
Vincent didn't send me. Patrick did.

00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:20.591
Patrick?

00:13:21.884 --> 00:13:26.639
Yes, he asked me to stay with you.

00:13:26.722 --> 00:13:31.602
And since I'm sweet
and caring, I couldn't say no.

00:13:32.019 --> 00:13:32.937
Madeth.

00:13:33.521 --> 00:13:35.606
Madeth, Madeth, Madeth.

00:13:36.524 --> 00:13:37.566
Feel at home.

00:13:39.318 --> 00:13:43.322
You have access to the kitchen,
the living room… anywhere.

00:13:44.823 --> 00:13:48.327
Huh? Miss Mia, can I eat?

00:13:48.994 --> 00:13:51.455
Oh, dinner! Thank you, Miss Mia!

00:13:51.539 --> 00:13:53.916
Miss Mia, thank you so much.

00:13:55.084 --> 00:13:58.504
Wow. Patrick really is
the password to unlocking you.

00:14:01.298 --> 00:14:04.760
- Dinosaur! Dinosaur!
- Dinosaur! Dinosaur!

00:14:04.843 --> 00:14:06.887
- I'm not a dinosaur.
- I'm not a dinosaur.

00:14:06.971 --> 00:14:09.598
- My name is Trexy.
- My name is Trexy.

00:14:09.682 --> 00:14:12.309
A talking dinosaur?

00:14:13.352 --> 00:14:15.396
- Ahh!
- Ahh!

00:14:18.065 --> 00:14:21.026
We'll remember Trexy.

00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:22.736
Matmat.

00:14:23.153 --> 00:14:25.739
Isn't Trexy, Mister Junior's child?

00:14:26.282 --> 00:14:27.908
Adopted.

00:14:27.992 --> 00:14:31.495
Mister Junior adopted Trexy.

00:14:32.037 --> 00:14:37.543
He lost his mother and had nowhere to go.

00:14:39.753 --> 00:14:42.673
Why did Mister Junior
let Trexy live there?

00:14:43.841 --> 00:14:48.762
Because he's old and knows a lot.

00:14:49.513 --> 00:14:53.017
He'll take care of him.

00:14:53.851 --> 00:14:56.478
Trexy's still a little kid.

00:14:56.562 --> 00:14:58.230
Matmat, you're old too, right?

00:15:00.149 --> 00:15:05.571
Matmat's no kid. He's 35 years old.

00:15:06.864 --> 00:15:09.700
I could be Trexy's big brother.

00:15:10.826 --> 00:15:14.288
So you can be a big brother to others?

00:15:16.916 --> 00:15:19.960
I don't know how to be one.

00:15:20.044 --> 00:15:21.879
I'm the youngest.

00:15:22.421 --> 00:15:24.924
I don't know how
to take care of someone younger.

00:15:30.596 --> 00:15:31.847
You can.

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:35.935
You can be a big brother too.

00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:41.065
Remember that patient at OK Hospital?

00:15:41.649 --> 00:15:43.359
You're older than him.

00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:47.196
You're like his big brother.

00:15:48.572 --> 00:15:49.573
You mean Kai?

00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:52.785
Yes, Kai.

00:15:53.202 --> 00:15:55.496
You can be his big brother.

00:15:57.081 --> 00:15:59.166
Just practice.

00:16:00.542 --> 00:16:02.503
Isn't Matmat…

00:16:04.129 --> 00:16:05.589
always a big brother to you?

00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:17.810
Oh! No way!

00:16:18.185 --> 00:16:20.562
Come on, do it!

00:16:27.569 --> 00:16:32.032
Oh, Miss Mia,
is there anything I can do for you?

00:16:32.116 --> 00:16:33.033
Not that I can think of.

00:16:34.034 --> 00:16:36.745
But I do have a question.

00:16:38.497 --> 00:16:41.625
Go ahead, Miss Mia, ask away.

00:16:43.544 --> 00:16:44.795
You see, yesterday…

00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:48.465
someone came here.

00:16:48.549 --> 00:16:50.426
Apparently, she's a fan of my mother.

00:16:52.136 --> 00:16:54.096
She came here, Miss Mia?

00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:56.765
Miss Mia, she followed you here?

00:16:56.849 --> 00:16:59.351
- That's an invasion of privacy!
- It's okay. I'm fine.

00:17:00.394 --> 00:17:03.355
She said she only came
here to wish me a happy birthday.

00:17:04.648 --> 00:17:05.524
Is that weird?

00:17:07.693 --> 00:17:08.777
Hmm…

00:17:09.862 --> 00:17:11.321
Not really.

00:17:13.323 --> 00:17:15.117
Really?

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:17.161
Well, you see, Miss Mia…

00:17:17.244 --> 00:17:19.830
that's just how it is
when you're fangirling.

00:17:19.913 --> 00:17:25.252
You follow all the social
media accounts of your idol.

00:17:25.335 --> 00:17:30.215
Even their siblings,
relatives, best friends,

00:17:30.299 --> 00:17:32.634
hair stylists, makeup artists,

00:17:32.718 --> 00:17:36.472
the owner of the pet salon
where they take their pets…

00:17:36.555 --> 00:17:40.434
You follow all of them and
wish them a happy birthday.

00:17:42.936 --> 00:17:43.937
Okay.

00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:46.106
If you say so.

00:17:46.982 --> 00:17:50.235
Yes, Miss Mia. That's just how it is
when you have an idol.

00:17:50.611 --> 00:17:57.618
I go to all the places
that are connected to my idol.

00:17:57.701 --> 00:18:00.871
I eat at
the restaurants where they dined.

00:18:00.954 --> 00:18:04.958
I bring home
confetti from their fanmeets.

00:18:05.042 --> 00:18:08.462
And when there's a concert,
I go near the stage

00:18:08.545 --> 00:18:13.133
and take the bottle
and straw my idol used

00:18:13.217 --> 00:18:14.885
- so I can take them home.
- What?!

00:18:15.344 --> 00:18:16.762
That's ridiculous!

00:18:16.845 --> 00:18:20.516
How can you be so sure
that it's the straw your idol used?

00:18:21.141 --> 00:18:24.269
Oh, Miss Mia,
if they're really your idol,

00:18:24.353 --> 00:18:26.688
you know what their breath smells like

00:18:27.106 --> 00:18:30.567
because you're familiar with
the mouthwash they're endorsing.

00:18:30.651 --> 00:18:34.613
Trust me, that's what I did
when 4ME2U had a concert here.

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:36.406
4ME2U?

00:18:36.490 --> 00:18:37.699
The K-pop group?

00:18:38.408 --> 00:18:39.618
Yes, Miss Mia.

00:18:40.369 --> 00:18:44.164
Unfortunately,
they disbanded back in 2015.

00:18:45.082 --> 00:18:49.545
You watched their concert back in 2015?

00:18:49.628 --> 00:18:50.671
Wait.

00:18:51.463 --> 00:18:52.631
How old are you?

00:18:53.966 --> 00:18:57.970
Oh, Miss Mia,
you don't ask a lady her age.

00:18:58.053 --> 00:18:59.429
You don't do that.

00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:03.392
Miss Mia, I'll go eat now
before your offer expires.

00:19:03.475 --> 00:19:05.102
Okay. Thank you!

00:19:10.983 --> 00:19:12.651
Where did they find Zelda?

00:19:12.734 --> 00:19:14.319
Around Verdevalle, ma'am.

00:19:14.403 --> 00:19:15.737
Verdevalle?

00:19:15.821 --> 00:19:18.699
Isn't that place just full of tall grass?

00:19:18.782 --> 00:19:20.909
Yes, that's where
they usually find corpses.

00:19:20.993 --> 00:19:23.162
What?!

00:19:23.245 --> 00:19:25.539
- Zelda!
- Please help me.

00:19:25.622 --> 00:19:28.292
- I need your help.
- What happened?

00:19:28.375 --> 00:19:32.379
- I don't want to die yet.
- Huh?

00:19:32.462 --> 00:19:34.298
- Please help me.
- What's the matter?

00:19:34.381 --> 00:19:38.677
No, no, no! I don't want to die!

00:19:42.014 --> 00:19:44.349
No, no, no!

00:19:44.433 --> 00:19:46.393
Give her something to calm her down.

00:19:46.476 --> 00:19:48.312
- Yes, doc.
- No, no, no…

00:19:48.395 --> 00:19:50.939
- Did something happen?
- No!

00:19:51.023 --> 00:19:53.066
Should we call the police?

00:19:58.155 --> 00:19:59.198
No, no…

00:19:59.281 --> 00:20:04.453
I'm okay, doc.

00:20:04.536 --> 00:20:05.954
No, no…

00:20:06.038 --> 00:20:09.333
I-I'm okay.

00:20:10.417 --> 00:20:12.085
There's no need for that.

00:20:12.169 --> 00:20:14.379
I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay.

00:20:14.463 --> 00:20:16.465
- Don't call the police.
- Let's get you cleaned up.

00:20:17.382 --> 00:20:18.508
- There's no need…
- Come on.

00:20:18.592 --> 00:20:20.260
There's no need to call the police, doc.

00:20:22.012 --> 00:20:23.847
Don't call the police, okay?

00:20:29.603 --> 00:20:31.647
I'll assess Zelda tomorrow, doc.

00:20:32.522 --> 00:20:34.274
Before she left,

00:20:34.358 --> 00:20:36.151
we were treating her for depression.

00:20:36.235 --> 00:20:37.653
But judging by her behavior,

00:20:37.736 --> 00:20:39.196
it looks like we have
to change her treatment.

00:20:40.656 --> 00:20:41.657
Alright.

00:20:44.034 --> 00:20:45.285
I wonder…

00:20:46.578 --> 00:20:47.663
What could've happened to her

00:20:47.746 --> 00:20:50.791
between leaving Mia's house
and the time she got back here

00:20:50.874 --> 00:20:52.876
for her to get hysterical like that?

00:21:09.351 --> 00:21:10.644
Are you almost done?

00:21:10.727 --> 00:21:11.853
Hmm.

00:21:15.148 --> 00:21:17.526
I-I'm almost done, doc.

00:21:17.609 --> 00:21:22.823
H-How much are you going to pay Matmat?

00:21:24.199 --> 00:21:25.826
And when are you going to pay me?

00:21:26.159 --> 00:21:28.829
I'll pay you once you're finished.

00:21:28.912 --> 00:21:31.248
But it seems you won't be
able to finish it until next week

00:21:31.707 --> 00:21:33.375
because you haven't
added any butterflies yet.

00:21:40.007 --> 00:21:44.219
L-Like Matmat said,
he doesn't like butterflies.

00:21:45.178 --> 00:21:47.180
He's afraid of butterflies.

00:21:47.264 --> 00:21:49.391
Didn't I ask you to think about it?

00:21:49.891 --> 00:21:52.602
You're making a mural
of the garden outside, right?

00:21:52.686 --> 00:21:54.396
Then of course,
you should add some butterflies.

00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:56.648
No butterflies, doc.

00:21:57.357 --> 00:21:58.942
N-No, no…

00:22:01.111 --> 00:22:03.363
Matmat, if you don't add butterflies,

00:22:03.447 --> 00:22:06.325
then you'll never get the job finished.

00:22:06.867 --> 00:22:09.703
And if you don't finish the job,
You won't get paid.

00:22:09.786 --> 00:22:11.997
Hmm?

00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:13.957
Y-You won't pay me?

00:22:16.418 --> 00:22:18.795
Y-You won't pay Matmat?

00:22:20.464 --> 00:22:21.840
Y-You won't pay me?

00:22:28.638 --> 00:22:30.849
H-He won't pay me.

00:22:30.932 --> 00:22:32.768
Poor Matmat.

00:22:36.313 --> 00:22:37.355
Scammer.

00:22:37.439 --> 00:22:40.567
D-Doc Anok is a scammer.

00:22:40.650 --> 00:22:44.237
He said he would pay Matmat, but…

00:22:44.988 --> 00:22:46.114
now, he doesn't want to.

00:22:47.365 --> 00:22:49.076
H-He's a scammer, right?

00:22:49.159 --> 00:22:50.869
S-Scammer.

00:22:50.952 --> 00:22:52.245
H-He's a scammer, right?

00:22:53.538 --> 00:22:54.998
- W-Why is he like that?
- Matmat.

00:22:55.082 --> 00:22:56.958
S-Scammer.

00:22:57.042 --> 00:22:58.460
- Scammer.
- Why did you take your stuff?

00:22:58.543 --> 00:23:00.003
You're not yet done with the mural?

00:23:02.339 --> 00:23:04.257
I-I don't want to draw there anymore.

00:23:04.341 --> 00:23:06.176
M-Matmat quits.

00:23:06.593 --> 00:23:08.261
Huh? Why?

00:23:09.721 --> 00:23:12.432
D-Doc Anok is a scammer.

00:23:12.516 --> 00:23:13.683
Scammer.

00:23:13.767 --> 00:23:15.393
He refuses to honor our agreement.

00:23:15.477 --> 00:23:18.897
H-He wants Matmat
to draw some butterflies.

00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:20.857
But I don't like butterflies.

00:23:21.942 --> 00:23:23.276
I don't like butterflies!

00:23:24.111 --> 00:23:25.862
But Matmat,
you're almost done with the mural.

00:23:25.946 --> 00:23:27.864
Just a little more,
and you'll get paid by Doc Anok.

00:23:29.699 --> 00:23:30.951
N-No.

00:23:31.034 --> 00:23:33.203
I won't go back there again.

00:23:33.286 --> 00:23:34.704
I-I quit.

00:23:34.788 --> 00:23:36.123
- Matmat.
- I quit.

00:23:36.206 --> 00:23:38.500
- Matmat!
- I won't go back there again.

00:23:38.583 --> 00:23:39.626
Matmat!

00:23:44.005 --> 00:23:45.298
Matmat.

00:23:45.382 --> 00:23:47.759
Matmat, I just want
to know what happened.

00:23:49.052 --> 00:23:50.178
Matmat.

00:23:52.097 --> 00:23:52.889
Matmat!

00:23:54.641 --> 00:23:57.602
On the count of three,
tell me what happened.

00:23:57.686 --> 00:23:58.520
One…

00:23:59.104 --> 00:24:00.063
two…

00:24:00.147 --> 00:24:04.901
L-Like Matmat said,
Doc Anok is a scammer.

00:24:04.985 --> 00:24:09.197
Matmat is almost done,
but he refuses to pay.

00:24:09.281 --> 00:24:12.951
He wants me to add butterflies!

00:24:13.034 --> 00:24:16.454
But Matmat, it's your job.
You can't just abandon it like it's a toy.

00:24:18.456 --> 00:24:20.041
I-I don't want to!

00:24:20.125 --> 00:24:21.960
- I don't want to!
- Matmat.

00:24:22.043 --> 00:24:23.295
- No!
- I'm still talking to you.

00:24:23.378 --> 00:24:24.254
Don't turn your back on me.

00:24:24.337 --> 00:24:26.298
- Matmat! Matmat!
- No! I don't want to!

00:24:26.381 --> 00:24:27.883
Matmat…

00:24:27.966 --> 00:24:30.135
Ah!

00:24:30.218 --> 00:24:33.263
Ow!

00:24:35.765 --> 00:24:37.309
O-Ouch!

00:24:37.392 --> 00:24:39.477
- I-It hurts!
- It hurts?!

00:24:40.145 --> 00:24:42.647
Now, you know how I feel when you hit me!

00:24:43.106 --> 00:24:46.443
Y-You should count to three

00:24:46.526 --> 00:24:48.403
so you can control yourself.

00:24:48.486 --> 00:24:50.280
Did you count to three before you bit me?

00:24:50.363 --> 00:24:54.284
Y-You shouldn't talk
to your older brother like that.

00:24:54.367 --> 00:24:56.286
If you don't want
me to talk to you like this,

00:24:56.369 --> 00:24:58.997
then act like
a proper older brother to me!

00:25:07.214 --> 00:25:09.925
Y-You're shouting at me?

00:25:10.008 --> 00:25:11.384
Matmat.

00:25:11.468 --> 00:25:14.179
Y-You're shouting at me?

00:25:14.554 --> 00:25:16.681
You're shouting at me?!

00:25:16.765 --> 00:25:21.144
- Hmm? Hmm? Hmm?
- Matmat--

00:25:22.604 --> 00:25:25.148
- Ouch!
- Is this what you want, huh?

00:25:25.232 --> 00:25:26.399
No!

00:25:27.609 --> 00:25:29.569
P-Patpat is so mean!

00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:35.575
P-Patpat is so mean!

00:25:41.039 --> 00:25:43.708
I don't like him anymore.
Patpat is no longer my brother.

00:25:43.792 --> 00:25:45.001
Go ahead and laugh.

00:25:45.085 --> 00:25:47.045
You've been beaten up,
and you're still laughing?

00:25:47.128 --> 00:25:48.630
I chose to fight back.

00:25:49.297 --> 00:25:51.132
We need to expand our world.

00:25:51.216 --> 00:25:53.635
Out of everyone in the world,
why does it have to be Mia?

00:25:53.718 --> 00:25:56.263
Because Mia is
the loneliest person I know.

00:25:56.346 --> 00:25:58.473
You're thinking of other people again.

00:25:58.556 --> 00:26:00.100
When will you think of yourself?

00:26:00.183 --> 00:26:02.686
Patpat only belongs to Patpat.

00:26:02.769 --> 00:26:04.854
P-Patpat is happy?
