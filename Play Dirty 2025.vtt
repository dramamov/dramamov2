[suspenseful music playing]

00:19.333 --> 00:21.333
[Parker] This guy, he's a real problem.

00:21.416 --> 00:22.583
[Philly] Yeah, okay.

00:22.666 --> 00:24.500
I mean, granted, the kid's a hothead.

00:24.583 --> 00:26.750
[Parker] He's putting stupid
all over everything.

00:26.833 --> 00:28.500
[Philly] Yeah, I get it,
but you can't kill him.

00:28.583 --> 00:29.833
[Parker] I'm pretty sure I can.

00:29.916 --> 00:31.166
[Philly] I'm not saying
you can't kill him.

00:31.250 --> 00:34.583
I'm saying you can't kill him.
He's Ed Mackey's wife's cousin.

00:34.666 --> 00:36.208
-[Parker] Brenda?
-[Philly] Yeah, yeah.

00:36.291 --> 00:37.458
He's Brenda's cousin.

00:37.541 --> 00:39.083
[Parker] Fine.

00:39.166 --> 00:41.291
We'll try talking to him first.

00:42.375 --> 00:43.583
Aren't we on a clock?

00:43.666 --> 00:47.041
Do we really have time
for whatever the fuck this is?

00:47.125 --> 00:50.291
Why the fuck is, uh, he here exactly?

00:50.375 --> 00:52.041
Him?

00:52.125 --> 00:54.791
-He's here because we think--
-"We think"?

00:54.875 --> 00:56.500
"We"? Is-is "we" you and this clown?

00:56.583 --> 00:58.458
Motherfucker shows up out of nowhere,

00:58.541 --> 01:00.541
and suddenly we're talking to him
about what he thinks?

01:00.625 --> 01:02.750
Last I checked,
this is your score, Philly.

01:02.833 --> 01:04.875
-Hey, kid, come here.
-[slaps]

01:04.958 --> 01:06.083
-Fuck.
-[slaps]

01:06.166 --> 01:07.291
No, no. Just look.

01:07.375 --> 01:09.875
Do yourself a favor, huh?

01:09.958 --> 01:12.791
Shut the fuck up.

01:14.208 --> 01:15.875
Yeah?

01:15.958 --> 01:17.083
Okay?

01:19.125 --> 01:20.875
Listen.

01:20.958 --> 01:22.541
I don't know you, asshole.

01:22.625 --> 01:23.791
What's more, you don't know me.

01:23.875 --> 01:27.250
I'm not one to, uh... to fuck with.

01:29.083 --> 01:32.000
Just ask around. My real name's Knox.

01:34.375 --> 01:35.916
That's nice.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.916
My real name is Parker.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.708
[chuckles] Okay, you're, uh--

01:42.708 --> 01:44.416
You're Parker?

01:46.500 --> 01:48.250
Well, listen, man,
I'm not trying to make trouble.

01:48.333 --> 01:49.875
I'm just doing my part.

01:49.958 --> 01:52.000
Your part?

01:52.083 --> 01:54.166
What, like threatening to shoot
the supervisor out there?

01:54.250 --> 01:55.666
Yeah, well, he was mouthing off.

01:55.750 --> 01:57.916
Yeah, but we can't shoot him.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.666
You know we can't shoot him.

01:59.750 --> 02:02.833
And now, since he called
your idiotic bluff, he knows it, too.

02:02.916 --> 02:05.916
Well, how do you know,
uh, that was a bluff, man?

02:06.000 --> 02:07.083
Jesus Christ.

02:07.166 --> 02:10.291
Oh, so your plan was to shoot the one guy
that we absolutely, positively need

02:10.375 --> 02:11.791
to finish this job?

02:11.875 --> 02:14.125
'Cause that would make you a psycho.

02:14.208 --> 02:15.458
So which is it?

02:15.541 --> 02:18.458
Are you an idiot or are you a psycho?

02:18.541 --> 02:21.250
I won't, uh, shoot...
I won't shoot anyone.

02:21.333 --> 02:22.958
I don't actually need a gun.
I think you should take it.

02:23.041 --> 02:24.750
-No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
-No, seriously, you take it, please.

02:24.833 --> 02:26.916
We don't need you useless.
We need you smart.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.458
Well, I can be smart.

02:28.541 --> 02:30.833
No, you can't. But you can pretend.

02:30.916 --> 02:35.750
So, before you make any move at all,
just imagine what a smart person might do,

02:35.833 --> 02:37.583
and then you do that instead, okay?

02:37.666 --> 02:39.166
Yeah, absolutely. I got it.

02:39.250 --> 02:40.916
And keep your fucking gun holstered.
You got it?

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
Yeah, okay.

02:42.083 --> 02:43.208
-You got it?
-Yeah, I got it.

02:43.291 --> 02:44.416
-Okay, great.
-Got it.

02:44.500 --> 02:45.541
Good. That's settled.

02:45.625 --> 02:46.708
Yeah.

02:46.791 --> 02:49.041
-Here we go.
-All right.

02:50.750 --> 02:51.833
You're fine.

02:53.666 --> 02:56.208
[drill whirring]

02:56.291 --> 02:57.458
Almost there.

03:03.500 --> 03:05.916
-[Parker] Mr. Supervisor.
-[Philly] Have a seat.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.708
[whirring continues]

03:12.833 --> 03:14.458
Which one is she?

03:14.541 --> 03:15.833
What?

03:16.916 --> 03:20.333
You're not this stupid,
and this ain't your money.

03:20.416 --> 03:22.750
If there's a robbery,
you're trained to just hand it over.

03:22.833 --> 03:25.583
Which means
you're trying to impress someone.

03:25.666 --> 03:26.916
My guess is it's a girl.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.791
No. No, please. Look.

03:29.875 --> 03:31.541
I want to marry her.

03:31.625 --> 03:32.916
You know, I can't just cave,
not in front of everybody.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.291
[lock clicks]

03:34.375 --> 03:36.125
We're through the first lock.

03:37.208 --> 03:38.750
All right, fine. Go thump him.

03:38.833 --> 03:40.208
What?

03:40.291 --> 03:42.000
[Parker] The kid.

03:42.083 --> 03:44.666
Deck him. He won't hit you back.

03:46.750 --> 03:49.333
-And then you open the vault for me.
-Really?

03:49.416 --> 03:51.541
You open it clean,

03:51.625 --> 03:54.166
no distress code, no delayed alarms,
and we're friends.

03:54.250 --> 03:57.041
You know we need you alive.

03:57.125 --> 04:01.750
The thing is, these other people,
we don't need them at all.

04:01.833 --> 04:03.291
Come on.

04:08.541 --> 04:09.416
[gasps]

04:09.500 --> 04:10.750
What the fuck, man?

04:10.833 --> 04:12.000
Ryan, you asshole!

04:12.083 --> 04:14.708
What the fuck are you doing?
You're gonna get us all killed!

04:16.250 --> 04:18.250
[Parker] Yeah, you'll make
a lovely couple.

04:23.707 --> 04:26.416
[wife] Joe, why can't we just park
out front like normal people?

04:26.500 --> 04:28.625
[Joe] What, pay 15 bucks
like normal people?

04:28.707 --> 04:31.125
Daddy works here. Daddy gets perks.

04:31.207 --> 04:32.375
[wife] Mm.

04:32.457 --> 04:34.332
[Joe] Hey. No, those cars
aren't supposed to be here.

04:34.416 --> 04:35.582
[wife] Seriously?

04:35.666 --> 04:36.875
So what?

04:36.957 --> 04:39.916
You gonna track them down
and charge them 15 bucks?

04:43.207 --> 04:45.207
[mysterious music playing]

04:58.957 --> 05:01.083
-[Parker] Come on, come on.
-[Philly] Let's beat it, Parker.

-[muffled chatter]

05:03.666 --> 05:04.875
Whoa.

[tense music playing]

05:13.916 --> 05:14.958
Jesus.

05:15.041 --> 05:16.625
Shit.

05:16.707 --> 05:18.500
Someone's robbing the place.

05:18.582 --> 05:19.875
[chuckles] What?

05:21.457 --> 05:22.375
[Parker] No, no, no, no, no.

05:22.457 --> 05:24.666
No ones, no fives. Big bills only.

05:24.750 --> 05:26.582
-We got to call 911.
-What?

05:26.666 --> 05:29.541
N-No, no, no, no, no, no.
No, we're not calling anyone.

05:29.625 --> 05:30.832
What are you talking about?

05:30.916 --> 05:32.041
Don't you see?

05:33.582 --> 05:34.791
This is perfect.

05:35.875 --> 05:37.000
I'm gonna rob the robbers.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
No.

05:39.082 --> 05:41.082
[energetic music playing]

05:46.041 --> 05:48.416

I never even had to pull my gun.

-Stay down.
-[Philly] Shit!

06:00.291 --> 06:01.833
[wife] Joe, what the fuck are you doing?

06:04.000 --> 06:05.375
Get Phil and the money to the car.

...money.

07:58.291 --> 07:59.666
The fuck?

07:59.750 --> 08:01.333
[Parker] This is yours.

08:01.416 --> 08:02.708
Hide it or the cops will take it.

08:02.791 --> 08:03.791
-Mm.
-[sirens wailing in distance]

08:07.541 --> 08:08.666
How bad is it, Philly?

08:08.750 --> 08:10.208
[Philly] Ah, fucking collarbone.

08:10.291 --> 08:11.750
Watch it, Zen! Fuck!

08:15.583 --> 08:18.166
-All right, there's a turnoff up here.
-Let her drive. She's doing fine.

08:36.040 --> 08:37.082
[groans]

08:37.165 --> 08:39.040
I had to pick this fucking job.

08:39.125 --> 08:40.875
Ponderous, man.

08:40.957 --> 08:41.957
It's fucking ponderous.

08:42.040 --> 08:43.957
We'll do the easy one next year. Come on.

08:44.040 --> 08:45.790
[Bett] Oh, shit.

08:45.875 --> 08:47.250
Think I'm gonna puke. Wait.

08:47.333 --> 08:48.583
-[urgent chatter]
-[Bett] Now, come on.

08:48.665 --> 08:49.833
[Philly] Sit me down.

08:49.915 --> 08:51.250
[Bett] You know you guys
are Internet famous?

08:51.333 --> 08:52.375
[groans]

08:52.458 --> 08:53.790
[Kinney] There's this whole,
like, horse Twitter.

08:53.875 --> 08:55.375
-Tape.
-[Philly groans]

08:55.458 --> 08:57.333
They want y'all dead.

08:57.415 --> 08:58.875
-Do it tight.
-Your eyes on me, all right?

08:58.958 --> 09:00.125
-Okay.
-It's not gonna feel good.

09:00.208 --> 09:02.291
Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay! Just get it done.

09:02.375 --> 09:03.750
[Beckler] Doesn't look so bad.

09:03.833 --> 09:05.375
I got a doctor we can trust.

09:05.458 --> 09:07.375
Can Philly, you know, last a couple hours?

09:07.458 --> 09:09.166
What, do I look
fucking unconscious to you?

09:09.250 --> 09:10.250
Ask me.

09:10.333 --> 09:11.708
"Hey, Philly, you gonna hang on
for a couple hours?"

09:11.791 --> 09:14.083
"Yes, I can. Go fuck yourself."

09:14.166 --> 09:15.916
I'll live.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.125
-I keep seeing that kid's face.
-[Bett] Knox?

09:18.208 --> 09:20.125
-Yeah, that was rough.
-Yeah.

09:20.208 --> 09:21.791
I mean, that could've been any one of us.

09:21.875 --> 09:24.625
Hey, asshole, it was one of us.

09:24.708 --> 09:26.583
It was me. Huh?

09:27.791 --> 09:29.208
Hit me.

09:29.291 --> 09:32.750
What I want to know is: Where the fuck
did that asshole come from out of nowhere?

09:32.833 --> 09:35.250
Guns blazing. Who was that guy?

09:35.333 --> 09:36.500
Some amateur.

09:37.708 --> 09:39.375
Bathroom?

09:39.458 --> 09:41.750
Over there. No door on it.

09:41.833 --> 09:42.915
Sorry.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.415
What did you say to the woman in the car?

09:45.958 --> 09:48.540
When you leaned back in.
You said something.

09:48.625 --> 09:50.000
I gave her ten grand.

09:51.958 --> 09:53.165
Mm.

09:54.250 --> 09:55.375
That was nice.

09:55.458 --> 09:58.333
I guess that makes up for shooting
her boyfriend in the head?

09:58.415 --> 10:00.500
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

10:01.833 --> 10:03.708
[Philly groans]

10:03.791 --> 10:05.333
Yeah.

10:05.416 --> 10:07.125
She kept the money.

10:07.208 --> 10:12.416
So maybe when the cops come around
asking questions, everything's a blur.

10:12.500 --> 10:13.750
Trust me, it's a good thing.

10:13.833 --> 10:16.500
Sure. Long as it comes out of your share.

10:16.583 --> 10:18.958
Everybody's an asshole today.

10:20.916 --> 10:22.083
Except for you.

10:22.166 --> 10:24.458
-Ah, thanks, old man.
-Oh, yeah, fuck.

10:30.208 --> 10:31.291
[sighs]

10:35.625 --> 10:37.958
-I'm muscle, not a numbers guy. This is--
-[Kinney laughing]

10:38.040 --> 10:40.333
I can see the smoke coming out your ears.
Give me it.

10:40.415 --> 10:42.208
-[laughter]
-This is like a third grader.

10:42.290 --> 10:44.040
Did you understand any of this?

10:44.125 --> 10:45.375
What the fuck is this shit?

10:45.458 --> 10:47.875
[chuckles] Look, it was a good score.

10:47.958 --> 10:51.625
What do we got?

54:24.041 --> 54:26.083
There's a shift change every night
at 1:00 a.m.

54:26.166 --> 54:29.375
That night, we'll make sure
the normal crew is otherwise detained.

54:29.458 --> 54:32.000
Once you're in, you need to take control
of our train and speed it up.

54:32.083 --> 54:33.125
[Grofield] Wait, wait, wait.

54:33.208 --> 54:35.666
Let me just interject
for-for a second here.

54:35.750 --> 54:39.083
You want two non-actors
who you want to play the MTA guys

54:39.166 --> 54:40.791
-when you got a trained thespian
right here?
-Grofield--

54:40.875 --> 54:42.708
I mean, have y'all even done
the background on these characters?

54:42.791 --> 54:44.083
What-what about their family life?

54:44.166 --> 54:45.458
-Grofield. Grofield, Grofield!
-Have you ever done the background on--

54:45.541 --> 54:47.458
Hey, hey, hey! I got a part for you, okay?

54:47.541 --> 54:49.541
You play the guy that shuts the fuck up.

54:49.625 --> 54:50.791
You know what to do.

54:50.875 --> 54:51.875
-[sighs]
-Relax.

54:53.291 --> 54:54.958
-Get it out, get it out.
-Fuck!

54:55.041 --> 54:56.958
There you go. All right.

54:57.041 --> 55:00.041
This is the MTA operations manual
for that particular control board.

55:00.125 --> 55:01.333
Yeah, study it.

55:01.416 --> 55:05.708
Also, according to Bosco's plans, they got
a guy in there on The Outfit's payroll.

55:05.791 --> 55:07.958
-His name is Glasscock.
-[Stan snickers]

55:08.041 --> 55:09.041
You motherfucker.

55:09.125 --> 55:10.416
[chuckles]

55:10.500 --> 55:11.916
[laughs]

55:12.000 --> 55:13.166
Are you fucking kidding me?

55:13.250 --> 55:14.875
[stammers]

55:14.958 --> 55:17.208
Just keep going, man.
Keep going. Keep going.

55:17.291 --> 55:18.708
You're doing a great job.

55:18.791 --> 55:20.125
[chuckles]

55:21.125 --> 55:24.375
[Parker] Once you speed up the train,
there's only one thing left to handle:

55:24.458 --> 55:27.333
a fail-safe
built into the station's tracks.

55:28.958 --> 55:32.000
It's designed to trip the brakes
on any train going over a certain speed.

55:34.708 --> 55:36.000
[dramatic music playing]

55:36.083 --> 55:38.375
The goal is 70 miles an hour.

55:39.666 --> 55:42.375
At that speed, it jumps the track,

55:42.458 --> 55:45.500
crashes down here,
slides into the dirt over there.

55:45.583 --> 55:47.916
We move in quick, grab the boxes,
including the big one.

55:48.000 --> 55:51.333
We'll have a cube truck standing by.
Stan, you need to get us one.

55:51.416 --> 55:52.500
[clicks tongue] No problem.

55:52.583 --> 55:54.875
We should have ten full minutes
to load it up, get gone.

55:54.958 --> 55:55.958
Plenty of time.

55:56.041 --> 55:57.500
Questions?

56:00.208 --> 56:02.041
All right, we'll meet again
5:00 p.m. tomorrow.

56:05.333 --> 56:06.875
[Ed] Party at our place?

56:07.875 --> 56:09.875
[intriguing music playing]

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
I'd like a room. The name's--

56:25.083 --> 56:26.666
Mr. Willis, is that you?

56:26.750 --> 56:28.958
And you can take a break.

56:29.041 --> 56:32.333
It's been years.
Perhaps three, if memory serves.

56:32.416 --> 56:34.833
-It serves. Is my usual room free?
-Uh, number 12.

56:34.916 --> 56:38.041
If it isn't,
I will just move the current occupant.

56:38.125 --> 56:40.166
Oh. Seems we're in luck.

56:48.625 --> 56:50.541
-Good evening, Mr. Willis.
-[pops]

56:50.625 --> 56:51.708
Champagne?

56:53.083 --> 56:54.166
What are you doing here?

56:54.250 --> 56:56.875
I said contact me only in an emergency.

56:56.958 --> 56:58.333
-Oh.
-I was clear.

56:58.416 --> 57:00.458
I got a room right down the hall.

57:00.541 --> 57:02.083
You don't mind, do you?

57:02.166 --> 57:03.958
Well, not if you're in it.

57:04.041 --> 57:05.083
Well...

57:06.958 --> 57:08.916
...I do have an emergency.

57:09.000 --> 57:10.416
Want to hear it?

57:17.083 --> 57:18.291
My zipper's stuck.

57:18.375 --> 57:20.750
Yeah, that's what I was afraid of.

57:21.750 --> 57:22.833
[scoffs softly]

57:22.916 --> 57:24.333
[Parker] Hey, treasure's on page one.

57:24.416 --> 57:26.208
[sighs]

57:26.291 --> 57:27.416
Oh, you can read?

57:27.500 --> 57:29.458
No, I just look at the pictures.

57:29.541 --> 57:31.291
You don't know that story, do you?

57:31.375 --> 57:33.458
Of The Lady of Arintero.

57:33.541 --> 57:35.250
-[stammers]
-Once upon a time...

57:35.333 --> 57:36.708
[sighs] Oh, my God,
you guys love this story.

57:36.791 --> 57:38.833
...in the 15th century--

57:38.916 --> 57:40.666
You're going to love it. Settle in.

57:40.750 --> 57:43.375
Most of Spain had been conquered.

57:43.458 --> 57:47.166
Until a mysterious knight
from León joined the fight.

57:47.250 --> 57:48.583
Wow.

57:48.666 --> 57:50.833
No one knew who he was,

57:50.916 --> 57:53.458
until during the Battle of Toro,

57:53.541 --> 57:59.000
another soldier swung a blade,
tore open his armor

57:59.083 --> 58:01.125
and exposed...

58:01.208 --> 58:03.041
[whispers] a female breast.

58:04.750 --> 58:06.375
Wow.

58:06.458 --> 58:08.500
So, like a transgender thing?

58:08.583 --> 58:11.333
No, not like a transgender thing.

58:12.750 --> 58:16.416
See, the point is she was a countess,
and she gave up everything--

58:16.500 --> 58:19.333
her position, her riches, her femininity--

58:19.416 --> 58:24.375
to fight as a man
for something bigger than herself.

58:24.458 --> 58:26.375
-That's the Lady of Arintero.
-Yes.

58:26.458 --> 58:27.875
And that's why they named
the ship after her.

58:27.958 --> 58:29.458
-Yeah.
-Because of the wardrobe malfunction.

58:29.541 --> 58:31.708
-Yeah.
-Tits hanging out.

58:32.916 --> 58:35.500
Stories like that shaped me as a kid.

58:36.833 --> 58:38.583
What shaped you, Parker?

58:38.666 --> 58:41.125
Well, I stole something
and I got away with it.

58:41.208 --> 58:42.375
Pretty simple.

58:42.458 --> 58:44.208
-You are simple.
-Yeah.

58:44.291 --> 58:46.416
You see, not everyone is
just a crook like you.

58:46.500 --> 58:49.291
For some people, like Ortiz,
this is about more--

58:49.375 --> 58:50.375
Treasure. All right?

58:50.458 --> 58:52.375
Cut the fucking noble bandito bullshit.

58:52.458 --> 58:55.041
He's stealing fucking treasure.

58:55.125 --> 58:57.083
From the people
who stole the treasure before him.

58:57.166 --> 58:58.541
-Guys are all crooks like me.
-Mm-hmm.

58:58.625 --> 58:59.625
They're just better at it.

58:59.708 --> 59:01.166
But thank you for the story.
It was very compelling.

59:01.250 --> 59:03.250
Well, here's another story for you.

59:03.333 --> 59:07.250
You, me, this, it has to work.

59:07.333 --> 59:10.375
I can't risk you getting cold feet, can I?

59:10.458 --> 59:11.541
Oh, I see.

59:11.625 --> 59:13.666
You came to warm my feet, huh?

59:14.250 --> 59:15.416
Mateo, no!

59:15.500 --> 59:16.916
[grunting]

59:20.083 --> 59:22.333
Him?! How could you?

59:22.416 --> 59:23.416
[grunts]

59:24.458 --> 59:26.458
[wind whistling]

59:29.666 --> 59:32.666
-[groaning]
-[mysterious music playing]

59:35.375 --> 59:38.000
[panting]

59:38.083 --> 59:39.166
[playful whistling]

59:39.250 --> 59:40.250
[Mateo] Hola.

59:40.333 --> 59:42.541
Look who's back, Tomas.

59:42.625 --> 59:44.791
My competition lover boy.

59:44.875 --> 59:46.541
Hey, does he look cold to you?

59:46.625 --> 59:48.875
Yeah. He does a little.

59:53.041 --> 59:54.583
I'm thinking cold

59:54.666 --> 59:56.375
-like this.
-[pained shout]

59:56.458 --> 59:57.916
[spits, whimpers]

59:58.000 --> 01:00:01.041
You'll die of exposure
in, what, half hour?

01:00:01.125 --> 01:00:03.291
Ah, which is a shame.

01:00:03.375 --> 01:00:05.375
Because The Outfit are coming
to claim your ass in an hour.

01:00:05.458 --> 01:00:07.250
What?

01:00:07.333 --> 01:00:09.291
Yeah, that's right.

01:00:09.375 --> 01:00:11.500
We made some calls.

01:00:11.583 --> 01:00:12.791
They were looking for you.

01:00:12.875 --> 01:00:14.833
The Outfit? Coming here?

01:00:14.916 --> 01:00:15.916
[stammers]

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.625
Are you guys really that stupid?

01:00:18.708 --> 01:00:22.125
You really think you offer me up,
The Outfit's gonna let you walk away?

01:00:22.208 --> 01:00:23.791
It ain't us they want. It's you.

01:00:23.875 --> 01:00:25.541
They already know what I'm doing.

01:00:25.625 --> 01:00:27.000
Means they also want to know
what you're doing.

01:00:27.083 --> 01:00:28.625
We're not doing anything.

01:00:28.708 --> 01:00:30.625
Oh, sure, you dumb fuck.
You tell them that.

01:00:30.708 --> 01:00:33.458
They'll still torture you just to be sure!

01:00:33.541 --> 01:00:35.666
I think you're forgetting something.

01:00:35.750 --> 01:00:37.666
We're not gonna be here.

01:00:37.750 --> 01:00:39.958
-Bye, now. Enjoy the weather.
-No.

01:00:42.375 --> 01:00:44.375
[suspenseful music playing]

01:00:47.916 --> 01:00:49.958
So they're early.

01:00:50.041 --> 01:00:51.375
It don't mean nothing.

01:00:53.125 --> 01:00:55.750
You're so sure, go check it out.

01:01:00.583 --> 01:01:03.250
Mateo. Listen.

01:01:03.333 --> 01:01:06.416
You fucked up, but I can fix this. Okay?

01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:08.666
Just uncuff me,
and we take them out together.

01:01:08.750 --> 01:01:10.041
Say what, asshole?

01:01:10.125 --> 01:01:12.125
I know them, how they work.

01:01:12.208 --> 01:01:14.125
-We just left you to die.
-Yes.

01:01:14.208 --> 01:01:17.125
You tried to kill me, all right?
I'm over it.

01:01:17.208 --> 01:01:20.250
Look at me.
Holding grudges is not how I do business.

01:01:20.333 --> 01:01:21.375
[Tomas screams in distance]

01:01:23.583 --> 01:01:25.625
Hey!

01:01:25.708 --> 01:01:26.791
It's getting late.

01:01:34.291 --> 01:01:35.875
[Zen] Uh-uh.

01:01:35.958 --> 01:01:37.916
I found you.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:39.083
My little traitor.

01:01:39.166 --> 01:01:41.208
Oh, traitor?

01:01:41.291 --> 01:01:45.166
Putting our entire country at risk
because you think I'm your girlfriend?

01:01:45.250 --> 01:01:46.750
Yeah, how'd you find us?

01:01:46.833 --> 01:01:48.541
You left your phone on
when you were sending me

01:01:48.625 --> 01:01:50.500
all of those bitchy text messages.

01:01:50.583 --> 01:01:52.666
What'd you do to Tomas?

01:01:52.750 --> 01:01:55.166
Nothing yet, but I think
I'm gonna shoot his dick off.

01:01:55.250 --> 01:01:57.208
That sounds fun.

01:01:57.291 --> 01:01:58.833
But we heard him scream.

01:01:58.916 --> 01:02:00.041
[Zen] What are you talking about?

01:02:00.125 --> 01:02:01.708
I thought that was you guys.

01:02:04.791 --> 01:02:06.416
-[twig snaps]
-Get down!

01:02:06.500 --> 01:02:08.583
[grunting, shouting]

01:02:08.666 --> 01:02:09.666
[bullet pings]

01:02:10.958 --> 01:02:12.666
[Mateo] The Outfit.

01:02:12.750 --> 01:02:14.208
You were right.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.625
You just... you just saved my life.

01:02:18.583 --> 01:02:19.583
You're welcome.

01:02:20.083 --> 01:02:21.583
[grunting]

01:02:26.541 --> 01:02:27.875
Fucker.

01:02:29.875 --> 01:02:31.916
It really is you.

01:02:33.708 --> 01:02:35.583
Kill me if you want.

01:02:35.666 --> 01:02:37.375
Okay.

01:02:38.416 --> 01:02:39.708
-[grunts]
-[keys jangle]

01:02:39.791 --> 01:02:42.208
-[phone vibrating]
-[panting]

01:02:48.250 --> 01:02:50.250
[suspenseful music playing]

01:02:53.791 --> 01:02:54.833
[phone beeps]

01:02:54.916 --> 01:02:57.291
Goddamn. What the hell's going on?

01:02:57.375 --> 01:02:59.083
I told you to report back.

01:02:59.166 --> 01:03:01.041
Was Parker really there?

01:03:01.125 --> 01:03:03.541
Yeah. He was.

01:03:05.666 --> 01:03:07.916
Well, shit fire and little fishes.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:09.458
Parker.

01:03:09.541 --> 01:03:11.791
What a surprise.

01:03:11.875 --> 01:03:13.291
And my two guys?

01:03:13.375 --> 01:03:14.750
Oh, let me look.

01:03:14.833 --> 01:03:16.041
Yep, dead.

01:03:17.125 --> 01:03:19.750
Hey. We had a deal, asshole.

01:03:19.833 --> 01:03:22.583
You stay out of my city, I don't kill you.

01:03:22.666 --> 01:03:24.416
How fucking hard is that?

01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:26.458
-What was that first part again?
-[groans]

01:03:26.541 --> 01:03:28.458
I should've put you down

01:03:28.541 --> 01:03:30.083
three years ago.

01:03:30.166 --> 01:03:31.833
I let you live.

01:03:31.916 --> 01:03:32.916
Yeah?

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:37.166
Gave you a pass 'cause you killed my boss,
which I admit was very good for me.

01:03:37.250 --> 01:03:40.125
Bullshit. I got to him.
That meant I could get to you.

01:03:40.208 --> 01:03:41.625
You were scared shitless.

01:03:41.708 --> 01:03:43.333
[laughs] Sc-- Scared?

01:03:43.416 --> 01:03:44.666
Of you?

01:03:44.750 --> 01:03:45.916
Hey.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:47.916
I run The Outfit, bitch.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:49.708
I point,

01:03:49.791 --> 01:03:50.791
people vanish.

01:03:50.875 --> 01:03:52.083
I got a fucking army!

01:03:52.166 --> 01:03:53.791
Uh, minus two, last time I checked.

01:03:53.875 --> 01:03:56.666
Like I give a shit, you child.

01:03:56.750 --> 01:04:00.208
Let's see if you can hold this
in what's left of your brain.

01:04:00.291 --> 01:04:03.083
You're one lone psycho.

01:04:03.166 --> 01:04:05.833
You can't take down
an entire organization.

01:04:05.916 --> 01:04:07.333
It's not possible.

01:04:07.416 --> 01:04:10.125
Nobody tells me where I get to walk.

01:04:10.208 --> 01:04:11.458
Okay, great, fine.

01:04:11.541 --> 01:04:13.166
Then you'll be dead by morning.

01:04:13.250 --> 01:04:15.250
Oh, oh, oh, oh! Almost forgot.

01:04:15.333 --> 01:04:18.083
Now, that genius caper
you've been planning?

01:04:18.166 --> 01:04:20.041
I've been ahead of you this whole time.

01:04:20.125 --> 01:04:23.041
So you can forget it, pal.

01:04:23.125 --> 01:04:24.291
It's over.

01:04:24.375 --> 01:04:25.541
What's over?

01:04:25.625 --> 01:04:27.083
The heist.

01:04:27.166 --> 01:04:29.625
I bumped it up, you arrogant prick.

01:04:29.708 --> 01:04:30.833
See, it's not tomorrow.

01:04:30.916 --> 01:04:33.333
It's now. You lose.

01:04:33.416 --> 01:04:35.166
-[line beeping]
-[mutters]

01:04:35.250 --> 01:04:36.500
Oh, shit.

01:04:36.583 --> 01:04:38.500
Come on.

01:04:38.583 --> 01:04:39.833
Oh, shit. Come on!

01:04:39.916 --> 01:04:41.333
[Zen] Hey! Whoa, hey.
I got you. I got you.

01:04:41.416 --> 01:04:42.708
[Parker mutters] We got to go now.

01:04:42.791 --> 01:04:43.875
[Zen] I got you. Come on.

01:04:43.958 --> 01:04:46.541
-Get me in the fucking car.
-Yeah.

01:04:46.625 --> 01:04:48.541
[dramatic music playing]

01:04:48.625 --> 01:04:50.208
[horn blares]

01:04:52.083 --> 01:04:53.750
[phone keys beeping]

01:04:53.833 --> 01:04:55.458
[cat meows]

01:04:55.541 --> 01:04:57.541
[cell phone ringing]

01:04:58.916 --> 01:05:00.166
[groans]

01:05:00.250 --> 01:05:01.541
Shit.

01:05:01.625 --> 01:05:04.666
Ow, Mommy dearest.

01:05:04.750 --> 01:05:06.250
[groans]

01:05:06.333 --> 01:05:08.250
-[Grofield] Yeah?
-The heist is happening now.

01:05:08.333 --> 01:05:09.875
Everything got moved up 24 hours.

01:05:09.958 --> 01:05:12.708
Ooh. I like it when you call me
Pookie, girl. [laughs]

01:05:12.791 --> 01:05:14.333
-[mumbling]
-Grofield?

01:05:14.416 --> 01:05:16.291
-Grofield, are you there?
-Huh? Oh, oh, oh!

01:05:16.375 --> 01:05:18.750
Shit. Hey, Parker. [grunts]

01:05:18.833 --> 01:05:20.291
Hey, Parker. How's it going?

01:05:20.375 --> 01:05:22.166
The heist is happening right now.

01:05:22.250 --> 01:05:25.208
-You got to move. Is everyone still there?
-[burps]

01:05:25.291 --> 01:05:26.791
-Are you ready? Now, remember.
-[shouting wildly]

01:05:26.875 --> 01:05:28.708
Okay, let's go. Okay, let's--

01:05:28.791 --> 01:05:29.958
[wild shouting continues faintly]

01:05:30.041 --> 01:05:31.333
Yeah. Yeah.

01:05:31.416 --> 01:05:33.041
We're, uh... we ready. Yeah, we ready.

01:05:33.125 --> 01:05:34.875
You been-- We been ready. You ready?

01:05:34.958 --> 01:05:37.458
[sighs] Fucking kidding me.

01:05:37.541 --> 01:05:38.750
Everything's the same, all right?

01:05:38.833 --> 01:05:41.000
Well, it's not the same
because it's not tomorrow.

01:05:41.083 --> 01:05:43.291
Remember, shift change happens
at 1:00, all right?

01:05:43.375 --> 01:05:45.708
-So if you miss it--
-Shut the fuck up and we won't! Go.

01:05:45.791 --> 01:05:47.791
-Go!
-Ed, get your snow bunny. Get her.

01:05:47.875 --> 01:05:49.875
-Hey, that's not nice.
-Get to hoppin'! Get to hoppin'!

01:05:49.958 --> 01:05:50.958
That's not nice.

01:05:53.125 --> 01:05:54.791
Stan!

01:05:55.875 --> 01:05:57.541
Stan. Hi.

01:05:57.625 --> 01:05:59.000
Oh, hey. Whoa.

01:05:59.083 --> 01:06:00.250
Cube truck!

01:06:00.833 --> 01:06:02.416
Yes. Truck. Yes.

01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:04.666
-Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yes, yes.
-Are you here, man? Are you woke?

01:06:04.750 --> 01:06:07.333
Is it working for you? Can you do this?

01:06:07.958 --> 01:06:09.791
You think I ever stole a truck sober?

01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:12.125
Goddamn, your breath stink, man!

01:06:12.208 --> 01:06:13.458
Get it together, a'ight?

01:06:13.541 --> 01:06:14.875
You need to get that shit together

01:06:14.958 --> 01:06:16.000
-and stop drinking on the jo--
-[horn honks]

01:06:16.083 --> 01:06:17.875
-[driver] Get out of the road!
-Oh! Motherfucker!

01:06:17.958 --> 01:06:19.375
You don't see me walking?!

01:06:19.458 --> 01:06:20.916
[passing horns blaring]

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.500
Sorry, the heat is up as high as it goes.

01:06:23.583 --> 01:06:24.708
Oh, that's okay.

01:06:24.791 --> 01:06:27.333
I'll just warm my hands over
the fiery wreckage when we crash.

01:06:27.416 --> 01:06:29.708
Mm, you used to like my driving.

01:06:29.791 --> 01:06:32.083
-[engine whirring]
-[tires squealing]

01:06:33.083 --> 01:06:35.041
-[Brenda] Okay. Fuck. Shit.
-Okay.

01:06:35.125 --> 01:06:37.166
Where did Parker get this, Baby Gap?

01:06:37.250 --> 01:06:39.166
I wouldn't worry about it too much, honey.

01:06:39.250 --> 01:06:41.541
If you walk in there looking like that,
they're definitely gonna let us in.

01:06:42.125 --> 01:06:43.166
Oh, really?

01:06:43.250 --> 01:06:44.916
[intriguing music playing]

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:46.083
[grunts]

01:06:47.125 --> 01:06:48.500
Hey!

01:06:48.583 --> 01:06:50.500
-Hey!
-[laughing]

01:06:51.791 --> 01:06:53.791
Yeah. Welcome to Brooklyn.

01:06:53.875 --> 01:06:54.875
[laughing]

01:06:54.958 --> 01:06:56.541
I'm so stupid. Why didn't I think--

01:06:57.666 --> 01:06:59.208
[tires squealing]

01:07:00.208 --> 01:07:01.500
We're too late.
Shift change already happened.

01:07:01.583 --> 01:07:03.208
Oh, don't worry. I got this.

01:07:06.083 --> 01:07:07.166
-Okay.
-Thank you.

01:07:09.416 --> 01:07:10.458
You in there, open up.

01:07:10.541 --> 01:07:12.166
This is Supervisor Lewis.

01:07:12.250 --> 01:07:14.833
We've got a security issue here.

01:07:14.916 --> 01:07:16.416
-Security issue?
-Yeah.

01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:19.083
Open the door,
and we'll tell you everything about it.

01:07:19.166 --> 01:07:21.416
Yeah, we can't, Mr...

01:07:21.500 --> 01:07:23.291
-It's Lewis. Yeah.
-Lewis.

01:07:23.375 --> 01:07:24.708
Not without the proper written order.

01:07:24.791 --> 01:07:27.208
Listen to me, okay?

01:07:27.291 --> 01:07:30.000
You've got a guy in there
by the name of Glasscock.

01:07:30.083 --> 01:07:31.083
This guy is up to something.

01:07:31.166 --> 01:07:33.583
For some reason,
he rerouted a refuse train.

01:07:33.666 --> 01:07:35.458
You don't believe me, check the board.

01:07:35.541 --> 01:07:36.875
What are they talking about?

01:07:36.958 --> 01:07:38.541
[mutters] I don't know, you know...

01:07:39.750 --> 01:07:40.833
[sighs]

01:07:40.916 --> 01:07:42.166
-Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
-Oh, God.

01:07:42.250 --> 01:07:44.250
Glasscock, Jesus. What are you doing?

01:07:44.333 --> 01:07:45.416
-Gun. Gun.
-Oh, he's got a gun. Right.

01:07:45.500 --> 01:07:47.916
-All right, I-I didn't anticipate that.
-No, clearly.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:49.708
How the fuck did you know?

01:07:49.791 --> 01:07:51.458
-[Ed] Take it easy. Take it easy.
-Shit!

01:07:51.541 --> 01:07:52.833
-Everything's gonna be fine.
-Back, back, back.

01:07:52.916 --> 01:07:55.583
All right, everybody, back!
Just stay back, all right?

01:07:55.666 --> 01:07:57.166
Put your hands up! You, get your hands up!

01:07:57.250 --> 01:07:58.375
Get your hands up!

01:07:58.458 --> 01:08:00.416
Goddamn it.

01:08:00.500 --> 01:08:02.625
-Okay.
-Great plan, Ed. Really cunning.

01:08:02.708 --> 01:08:04.125
Is that value added?

01:08:04.208 --> 01:08:06.708
[quiet chatter]

01:08:14.333 --> 01:08:16.125
Hey.

01:08:16.207 --> 01:08:17.457
-Hey!
-[horn honks]

01:08:17.541 --> 01:08:18.957
Fuck. Whoa.

01:08:19.041 --> 01:08:20.541
Get out of my truck.

01:08:20.625 --> 01:08:22.541
-Hey. Uh, no.
-[retches]

01:08:22.625 --> 01:08:25.250
-Jesus.
-[vomiting]

01:08:25.332 --> 01:08:26.791
Look, Joey, look, it's all over the truck.

01:08:26.875 --> 01:08:28.166
-Would you get the key?
-[Stan coughs]

01:08:28.250 --> 01:08:29.582
Just get out of the--

01:08:29.666 --> 01:08:31.291
Today of all days.

01:08:31.375 --> 01:08:34.207
No. No, no, no, no, no. Asshole.

01:08:34.291 --> 01:08:35.291
Don't do that.

01:08:35.375 --> 01:08:37.125
-No, no, no, no. Don't.
-[engine starts]

01:08:37.207 --> 01:08:39.207
Don't... Don't smile at me.

01:08:39.291 --> 01:08:41.041
Come on! Hey! Hey!

01:08:41.125 --> 01:08:42.207
-Hey, hey!
-[tires squealing]

01:08:42.291 --> 01:08:43.791
[toys squeaking]

01:08:48.582 --> 01:08:50.957
[energetic music playing]

01:08:59.166 --> 01:09:01.250
[Glasscock] It's just
a goddamn trash train, right?

01:09:01.332 --> 01:09:03.125
I didn't want to take their money.
I just--

01:09:03.207 --> 01:09:05.666
They offered it to me.
I said, "Sure, I need money.

01:09:05.750 --> 01:09:07.916
-I got these bills..."
-[door buzzes]

01:09:09.332 --> 01:09:10.750
[grunting]

01:09:10.832 --> 01:09:13.457
Oh! Way to go, Supervisor Lewis!

01:09:13.541 --> 01:09:15.625
-Yeah!
-Yes!

01:09:15.707 --> 01:09:17.582
-Who pushed the button? You did?
-[laughter, relieved chatter]

01:09:17.666 --> 01:09:18.707
Yeah, it was me.

01:09:18.791 --> 01:09:20.041
[worker] Ah, well done.

01:09:20.125 --> 01:09:21.166
Thank you. Appreciate it.

01:09:21.250 --> 01:09:22.457
-Thank you very much.
-Awesome. Fantastic.

01:09:22.541 --> 01:09:24.166
Thank you.

01:09:24.250 --> 01:09:27.582
Now please put your hands in the air, and,
everyone, get your backs against the wall.

01:09:27.666 --> 01:09:28.750
We're taking over this trash train.

01:09:28.832 --> 01:09:30.791
-Right?
-Huh?
-[others groaning]

01:09:31.916 --> 01:09:33.166
Ow. What the--

01:09:33.250 --> 01:09:34.707
-[Ed] Come on, let's go.
-[Brenda] You heard him.

01:09:34.791 --> 01:09:36.125
Back up.

01:09:36.207 --> 01:09:38.582
Are we, like, being punked here or...?

01:09:40.832 --> 01:09:41.957
Eyes up.

01:09:42.041 --> 01:09:43.332
Somebody, check in.

01:09:44.541 --> 01:09:46.291
Where the fuck is everybody?

01:09:46.375 --> 01:09:47.416
[worker 2] Are you gonna shoot us?

01:09:47.500 --> 01:09:49.125
[Brenda] Oh, wow.

01:09:49.207 --> 01:09:50.500
Um, I mean, maybe, yeah.

01:09:50.582 --> 01:09:52.582
I don't know, but that's
what makes this so exciting.

01:09:52.666 --> 01:09:54.041
-Right, babe?
-Yep.

01:09:54.125 --> 01:09:55.541
Yeah. Oh, okay, sorry.

01:09:55.625 --> 01:09:57.416
We had to mute you before,
but we're in now. Almost--

01:09:57.500 --> 01:09:59.208
No, no, no, no.
Every-Everything here is wrong.

01:09:59.291 --> 01:10:00.500
The board doesn't match.

01:10:00.583 --> 01:10:01.833
Well, maybe you have it backwards.
[chuckles]

01:10:01.916 --> 01:10:03.291
Backwards? Me?

01:10:03.375 --> 01:10:06.083
Okay. At the Trenton job, you're the one
that thought a six was a nine.

01:10:06.166 --> 01:10:07.208
So, just saying.

01:10:07.291 --> 01:10:09.208
Listen, it takes time
to speed the train up.

01:10:09.291 --> 01:10:11.375
-It's got to happen now.
-Y-- Yeah, yeah, we're on it.

01:10:11.458 --> 01:10:13.041
Well, there should've been
a line under it.

01:10:13.125 --> 01:10:14.791
Okay, under the six? Oh, I'm sorry.

01:10:14.875 --> 01:10:16.500
Last time I checked,
Trenton was in America, not Europe.

01:10:16.583 --> 01:10:17.875
Oh, good point.
Hey, also, please feel free to--

01:10:17.958 --> 01:10:19.791
It's the keypad on the right.

01:10:19.875 --> 01:10:21.166
-What?
-What?

01:10:21.250 --> 01:10:23.208
That board's new.
We got it a couple weeks back.

01:10:23.291 --> 01:10:24.250
There we go.

01:10:24.333 --> 01:10:25.833
Hey, Bruno Mars says
it's the one on the right.

01:10:25.916 --> 01:10:27.041
-Okay, okay.
-[worker] Damn it, Lou.

01:10:27.125 --> 01:10:28.625
Why you helping these people?

01:10:28.708 --> 01:10:29.875
Divorced parents.

01:10:29.958 --> 01:10:31.375
I-I can't stand the bickering.

01:10:33.125 --> 01:10:34.916
-[Ed] There we go.
-[Brenda] All the way, all the way.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:36.583
-[chuckles]
-Okay.

01:10:36.666 --> 01:10:38.250
-Whoa!
-[dramatic music playing]

01:10:42.875 --> 01:10:44.958
[Ed] All right, Parker, we got it.
The speed is climbing.

01:10:45.041 --> 01:10:46.750
We are at 30 MPH.

01:10:48.583 --> 01:10:50.291
35 MPH.

01:10:50.375 --> 01:10:51.583
[hushed] Stop saying "MPH."

01:10:51.666 --> 01:10:52.708
[Parker] Keep it maxed.

01:10:52.791 --> 01:10:53.958
It's got to be twice that
going into the turn.

01:11:01.583 --> 01:11:03.833
Grofield, please tell me
you're in position.

01:11:03.916 --> 01:11:05.416
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:11:05.500 --> 01:11:07.041

01:11:12.750 --> 01:11:13.958
All right. [groans]

01:11:14.041 --> 01:11:15.958
Yeah. Just found parking.

01:11:18.791 --> 01:11:20.791
[panting, grunting]

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:22.916
Grofield?

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:24.125
Grofield, are you there?

01:11:24.208 --> 01:11:25.916
Hey. [chuckles] What's happening, my man?

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:27.166
Hey, how are you?

01:11:27.250 --> 01:11:28.625
It's coming, the train.
You should be able to see it.

01:11:28.708 --> 01:11:29.750
We good?

01:11:30.958 --> 01:11:32.250
Shit.

01:11:34.041 --> 01:11:36.458
Okay, go. Go-go-go, no-no.

01:11:36.541 --> 01:11:38.541
Shit! Shit!

01:11:38.625 --> 01:11:40.541
Fucking piece--

01:11:40.625 --> 01:11:42.000
Goddamn it! Come on, come on.

01:11:42.083 --> 01:11:44.500
-[mutters] Come on! Come on! Fuck!
-[train horn blowing in distance]

01:11:44.583 --> 01:11:46.916
[Ed] Parker, we're at 50.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:48.166
Fifty-five.

01:11:48.250 --> 01:11:49.583
Shit, it's gonna be close.

01:11:49.666 --> 01:11:52.000
Zen and I are almost there.
Grofield, are we good?

01:11:52.083 --> 01:11:53.500
-Come on! Come on!
-[train horn approaching]

01:11:53.583 --> 01:11:54.958

[men murmuring]

01:12:09.833 --> 01:12:11.666
[train horn blares]

01:12:12.666 --> 01:12:15.333
[Ed] Parker, the train passed the trip.

01:12:15.416 --> 01:12:16.375
Grofield did it.

01:12:16.458 --> 01:12:18.208
We are at 60.

01:12:18.291 --> 01:12:20.250
[train horn blares]

01:12:27.750 --> 01:12:29.666
[Parker] All right, this is it.
Here we go.

01:12:29.750 --> 01:12:31.750
[train horn blowing in distance]

01:12:35.083 --> 01:12:36.583

01:12:55.333 --> 01:12:56.375
Um...

01:12:56.458 --> 01:12:57.791
[beeping]

01:12:57.875 --> 01:13:00.708
Uh, guys? The-the train--

01:13:00.791 --> 01:13:02.291
It missed. We missed.

01:13:02.375 --> 01:13:03.666
It wasn't going fast enough.

01:13:03.750 --> 01:13:05.041
Okay, d-do we stop it?

01:13:06.833 --> 01:13:08.041
No. No.

01:13:08.125 --> 01:13:09.208
Keep it going, fast as you can.

01:13:09.291 --> 01:13:10.833
There's another turn just up the tracks.

01:13:10.916 --> 01:13:13.083
Uh, yes. Yeah, all right. I see it.

01:13:13.166 --> 01:13:14.958
It's at, uh, 23rd and Court.

01:13:15.041 --> 01:13:16.166
Like a 90-degree bend.

01:13:16.250 --> 01:13:18.791
Everybody got that?
23rd and Court. Get there. Move.

01:13:18.875 --> 01:13:21.666
-Ed, there's gonna be another trip switch.
-No, I'm way ahead of you.

01:13:21.750 --> 01:13:25.750
It's across the street from the post
office just before you reach the turn.

01:13:27.666 --> 01:13:30.375
If I shortcut through Dutch Kills Green,
I should beat it there.

01:13:30.458 --> 01:13:31.875
-Oh, no.
-[dog barking]

01:13:31.958 --> 01:13:33.458
No, no, no, no, no, no! Hey!

-Hey. Ah.
-[growls softly]

01:13:34.958 --> 01:13:36.250
That's where I left that thing.

01:13:36.333 --> 01:13:37.958

All right.

01:14:03.041 --> 01:14:04.541
Where are you?

01:14:04.625 --> 01:14:06.541
Where?

01:14:09.375 --> 01:14:11.958
Okay, trip switch. Trip switch.

01:14:17.125 --> 01:14:18.250
What was that?

01:14:19.333 --> 01:14:22.625
Uh, guys, I think I just hit Grofield.

01:14:22.708 --> 01:14:24.750
You what? Stan, come again?

01:14:24.833 --> 01:14:26.708

[Ed] Speed seems about right this time.

01:14:44.750 --> 01:14:46.958
That T stop is coming up pretty fast.

01:14:48.125 --> 01:14:49.291
[Parker] Grofield?

01:14:49.375 --> 01:14:50.708
Shit. What's happening?

01:14:50.791 --> 01:14:52.875
Grofield, where the hell are you?

01:14:55.583 --> 01:14:57.333

Oh, no.

It's not what we planned.
It's too fucking high.

Fucking psycho.

Where the fuck is Stan?

01:17:18.250 --> 01:17:21.291

[mysterious music playing]

01:18:00.583 --> 01:18:02.333
Lozini pulled the treasure early.

01:18:02.416 --> 01:18:03.625
At the ghost station.

01:18:03.708 --> 01:18:05.708
The damn train left without it.

01:18:05.791 --> 01:18:07.375
No.

01:18:07.458 --> 01:18:08.625
That's wrong.

01:18:08.708 --> 01:18:11.416
Why would they run the trains?

01:18:11.500 --> 01:18:12.875
Or fill them up with rocks?

01:18:12.958 --> 01:18:14.083
[Grofield] Oh, shit!

01:18:14.166 --> 01:18:16.000
Well, because

This car is fucked!

-Hey, nice cube truck, Stan.

01:19:45.500 --> 01:19:47.625
Come on, let's go.
Get us the fuck out of here!

Ah, fuck, fuck.

Get in, get in, get in!

01:19:52.416 --> 01:19:54.250
All right, breathe.

[quiet chatter over TV]

01:20:05.583 --> 01:20:08.041
[newsman] What you see behind me
is what's left

01:20:08.125 --> 01:20:10.250
of the 7-line refuse train,

01:20:10.333 --> 01:20:14.166
which derailed sometime
after 1:00 a.m. this morning.

01:20:14.250 --> 01:20:16.666
Hey, hey, guys, guys.

01:20:16.750 --> 01:20:18.708
Would you look at that?

01:20:18.791 --> 01:20:21.250
Is that supposed to be you guys?

01:20:21.333 --> 01:20:22.375
[laughs]

01:20:23.666 --> 01:20:25.958
[Grofield] Turn that shit off, Stan.

01:20:26.041 --> 01:20:27.916
Pull your fucking pants up, man.

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:29.041
[remote clicks]

01:20:29.125 --> 01:20:30.791
Yeah, sorry.

01:20:37.583 --> 01:20:39.750
Hey, you rushing off so soon?

01:20:39.833 --> 01:20:41.333
Not much of a party.

01:20:41.416 --> 01:20:43.125
Plus I've got to go home
and break bad news

01:20:43.208 --> 01:20:45.250
to some people you've never met
nor give a shit about.

01:20:46.333 --> 01:20:47.625
Hey.

01:20:47.708 --> 01:20:50.541
You know, I didn't, uh, steal something
to get away with it.

01:20:50.625 --> 01:20:51.583
Come again?

01:20:51.666 --> 01:20:53.625
At the hotel.

01:20:53.708 --> 01:20:55.750
You asked me how I became a thief.
That wasn't it.

01:20:55.833 --> 01:20:56.833
There's a story.

01:20:56.916 --> 01:20:58.500
Oh. No, thank you.

01:20:58.583 --> 01:21:01.833
Come on, I listened to your fucking story.
You can at least listen to mine.

01:21:02.833 --> 01:21:04.000
It's good.

01:21:06.666 --> 01:21:07.666
I was eight.

01:21:07.750 --> 01:21:11.750
Only thing I'd ever stolen was
a bottle of bourbon one time.

01:21:11.833 --> 01:21:14.500
There were bullies,
older kids, bigger kids.

01:21:14.583 --> 01:21:17.250
They worked for this weed dealer
by the name of Maury.

01:21:17.333 --> 01:21:19.791
Meanest drunk in town.

01:21:19.875 --> 01:21:21.916
These kids, they ride around
making deliveries for the guy.

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:25.375
Anyway, one day,
I'm playing basketball with my friends.

01:21:25.458 --> 01:21:26.750
These fucking bullies show up.

01:21:26.833 --> 01:21:29.833
The biggest one, Cal, tells us
to fuck off, that this is his court.

01:21:29.916 --> 01:21:32.708
Slugged my friend in the face,
knocked him out cold.

01:21:35.208 --> 01:21:37.083
Look, I didn't have much that summer,

01:21:37.166 --> 01:21:39.208
but I had basketball,
and they took that from me.

01:21:39.291 --> 01:21:41.708
Let me guess. You killed them.

01:21:41.791 --> 01:21:43.791
At eight?

01:21:43.875 --> 01:21:45.500
No. [scoffs]

01:21:45.583 --> 01:21:47.000
But I waited.

01:21:47.083 --> 01:21:48.833
And I watched.

01:21:48.916 --> 01:21:53.583
Every Friday, that Cal guy,
he'd go visit this girl I knew.

01:21:53.666 --> 01:21:56.041
Steal her bike to go see Maury.

01:21:56.125 --> 01:21:58.000
He'd make her cry.

01:21:58.083 --> 01:22:00.291
I decided I was gonna do
something about that.

01:22:00.375 --> 01:22:02.333
What did you do?

01:22:02.416 --> 01:22:03.625
Dry her tears?

01:22:03.708 --> 01:22:05.333
No, I destroyed her bike.

01:22:05.416 --> 01:22:07.000
[scoffs]

01:22:07.083 --> 01:22:09.666
Ah. So when that asshole
came around, no bike.

01:22:09.750 --> 01:22:11.500
No bike for him.

01:22:11.583 --> 01:22:12.708
He's late for Maury.

01:22:12.791 --> 01:22:14.333
And Maury beats him-- bad.

01:22:14.416 --> 01:22:15.833
Breaks his arm.

01:22:15.916 --> 01:22:17.833
Sorry, I thought this was
a story about you stealing.

01:22:17.916 --> 01:22:18.916
It is.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.500
The bourbon, remember?

01:22:21.583 --> 01:22:25.166
I made sure that the meanest drunk in town
had a fifth in his car that day.

01:22:26.833 --> 01:22:29.208
So while that Cal guy is laid up
with a busted elbow--

01:22:29.291 --> 01:22:30.916
You were playing basketball.

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:32.791
All summer long.

01:22:32.875 --> 01:22:36.083
I was eight years old,
and I was a fucker with a plan.

01:22:36.166 --> 01:22:37.541
And I still am.

01:22:38.708 --> 01:22:41.583
Will you put down the bag?
This ain't over.

01:22:41.666 --> 01:22:43.541
[contemplative music playing]

01:22:48.125 --> 01:22:49.333
I got an idea.

01:22:50.416 --> 01:22:53.250
[Grofield] Oh, you got an idea.

01:22:53.333 --> 01:22:55.500
Hey, don't you think
it's a little bit too late for that?

01:22:56.583 --> 01:22:58.291
You're upset.

01:22:58.375 --> 01:23:00.666
You have every right to be,
so say what you want to say.

01:23:00.750 --> 01:23:03.083
Uh, I ain't got shit to say.

01:23:03.166 --> 01:23:05.333
I mean, maybe Stan might be wondering

01:23:05.416 --> 01:23:07.583
why the fuck he wearing
a bullet with your name on it.

01:23:07.666 --> 01:23:10.958
Or maybe he's curious about why you lied

01:23:11.041 --> 01:23:12.791
about The Outfit knowing
that you was here.

01:23:12.875 --> 01:23:14.000
Nah, I'm fine. Seriously.

01:23:14.083 --> 01:23:15.541
-Shut the fuck up, Stan.
-Shit happens. Yeah.

01:23:15.625 --> 01:23:17.416
[Grofield] Now, you told me, man. You--

01:23:17.500 --> 01:23:19.500
[scoffs] You said you got Kincaid
at the club.

01:23:19.583 --> 01:23:21.958
You remember you said that?
You said, "I took care of him."

01:23:22.041 --> 01:23:24.000
-Those were your words.
-I guess he lived.

01:23:24.083 --> 01:23:25.583
I guess he fucking did.

01:23:25.666 --> 01:23:27.625
Not to put too fine a point on it,
Parker, but your little--

01:23:27.708 --> 01:23:30.250
Fuck this goddamn tree.

01:23:30.333 --> 01:23:32.791
Your little fuckup just cost
the rest of us a shit ton of money.

01:23:33.375 --> 01:23:35.625
What idea, Parker?

01:23:35.708 --> 01:23:37.416
An idea for what to do next.

01:23:37.500 --> 01:23:39.541
[laughing]

01:23:39.625 --> 01:23:42.041
-This motherfucker. You funny.
-[Ed] What next, Parker?

01:23:42.125 --> 01:23:44.375
There is no fucking next. It's over.

01:23:44.458 --> 01:23:46.083
We-we-we lost. We got beat.

01:23:46.166 --> 01:23:47.333
You got beat.

01:23:47.416 --> 01:23:49.125
[Grofield] This ain't like you, Parker.

01:23:49.208 --> 01:23:51.333
You walk where the ice is thick.

01:23:51.416 --> 01:23:53.041
Remember that?

01:23:53.125 --> 01:23:56.125
You got the police, they in this,
and-and not to mention Lozini.

01:23:56.208 --> 01:23:59.166
How thin do you fucking want it? Huh?

01:23:59.250 --> 01:24:02.208
You're right. It's stupid.

01:24:02.291 --> 01:24:04.708
But I'm gonna keep going anyway.

01:24:04.791 --> 01:24:07.125
Okay.

01:24:07.208 --> 01:24:08.250
Tell us how.

01:24:08.333 --> 01:24:10.500
Look, we know The Outfit had buyers
lined up already.

01:24:10.583 --> 01:24:13.291
We know the gold, the jewels,
that's all been scattered at this point.

01:24:13.375 --> 01:24:14.916
Tell us something we don't know.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.333
They may be able to split up the treasure,

01:24:17.416 --> 01:24:19.750
but they can't split up the figurehead.

01:24:19.833 --> 01:24:21.541
The Lady of Arintero herself.

01:24:21.625 --> 01:24:23.958
Not without destroying her value.

01:24:24.041 --> 01:24:26.041
Come on, man, she's like any work of art.

01:24:26.125 --> 01:24:27.916
She needs to be intact.

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:29.125
Perfect.

01:24:29.208 --> 01:24:32.458
And she's probably worth
half the total score.

01:24:32.541 --> 01:24:34.875
Four hundred, 500 million all by herself.

01:24:34.958 --> 01:24:37.541
We just have to find her.

01:24:37.625 --> 01:24:39.500
Yeah, okay, okay, okay.

01:24:39.583 --> 01:24:42.291
But, uh, uh, what we...

01:24:42.375 --> 01:24:44.250
what we need to know is
the name of the buyer.

01:24:44.333 --> 01:24:47.166
Anybody know
who this lucky billionaire is?

01:24:47.250 --> 01:24:48.666
Actually, no.

01:24:49.958 --> 01:24:51.416
But I know someone we can ask.

01:24:51.500 --> 01:24:53.125
And who is that?

01:24:53.708 --> 01:24:56.208
The guy who fucked this all up
by not dying.

01:24:56.291 --> 01:24:57.833
Kincaid.

01:24:57.916 --> 01:24:59.708
-[knock on door]
-Yeah. Bathe me, baby.

01:24:59.791 --> 01:25:01.916
Uh, Mr. Kincaid.

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:03.250
Hey, something ain't right.

01:25:03.333 --> 01:25:04.958
What do you mean?

01:25:05.041 --> 01:25:07.333
People on Park Avenue are looking up.

01:25:07.416 --> 01:25:09.458
They're, like, staring.

01:25:09.541 --> 01:25:11.916
[Grofield] Look at you
with your shopping bags!

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.791
Look at you with your fucking video,
taking pictures!

01:25:14.875 --> 01:25:17.125
Well, take pictures when I fucking jump!

01:25:18.416 --> 01:25:20.333
The fucking Knicks!

01:25:20.416 --> 01:25:22.208
I kept the faith.

01:25:22.291 --> 01:25:24.500
I bet with my heart.

01:25:24.583 --> 01:25:26.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:25:26.083 --> 01:25:27.208
It was the lobby.

01:25:27.291 --> 01:25:29.791
There's some asshole on the roof
saying he's gonna jump.

01:25:30.458 --> 01:25:31.791
Show some urgency, Terry!

01:25:31.875 --> 01:25:33.333
Get up there and check it out!

01:25:33.416 --> 01:25:36.125
I got no house! No wife!

01:25:36.208 --> 01:25:38.500
[crying] I gave everything.

01:25:38.583 --> 01:25:40.583
-I lo-- Oh, shit.
-[crowd exclaims]

01:25:43.041 --> 01:25:45.708
-I lost, I lost everything!
-Hey, pal?

01:25:45.791 --> 01:25:46.750
Stay away from me!

01:25:46.833 --> 01:25:48.750
Easy, brother.
I just want to know who you are.

01:25:48.833 --> 01:25:50.375
Go right ahead and jump.

01:25:50.458 --> 01:25:52.583
Do me a favor, hit a cop. See if I care.

01:25:52.666 --> 01:25:55.166
-Huh?
-Boom! [groans]

01:25:55.250 --> 01:25:57.208
Nice job, Brando. Are you ready?

01:25:57.291 --> 01:25:58.958
Yeah, it just takes a second for me
to get out of the character.

01:25:59.041 --> 01:26:00.041
Shake it off.

01:26:01.041 --> 01:26:02.083
[sighs]

01:26:02.166 --> 01:26:04.166
Put this on for me.

01:26:04.250 --> 01:26:06.541
Come on. [grunts]

01:26:06.625 --> 01:26:07.750
Come on, let's get rid of him.

01:26:07.833 --> 01:26:09.458
[both grunting]

01:26:12.666 --> 01:26:14.666
[crowd screaming in distance]

01:26:14.750 --> 01:26:16.750
-[body thuds]
-[crowd clamoring]

01:26:20.583 --> 01:26:22.625
[Grofield sighs]

01:26:22.708 --> 01:26:24.541
Merry Christmas, Parker.

01:26:25.625 --> 01:26:27.625
Merry Christmas, Grofield.

01:26:27.708 --> 01:26:29.958
[sirens wailing in distance]

01:26:30.041 --> 01:26:31.666
That's our cue.

01:26:31.750 --> 01:26:32.958
Yeah.

01:26:37.125 --> 01:26:38.625
Police! Open the door, please!

01:26:38.708 --> 01:26:39.916
What's this about?

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.583
Sir, someone jumped off the building.
We just got to ask a few questions.

01:26:42.666 --> 01:26:43.666
Come on.

01:26:44.666 --> 01:26:46.208
-Yeah, sorry to bother you, sir.
-All right, take it easy.

01:26:46.291 --> 01:26:47.458
-Turn around.
-Whoa, whoa, yeah.

01:26:47.541 --> 01:26:48.583
-Straight to the room.
-Keep walking.

01:26:48.666 --> 01:26:49.916
-Come on, open the fucking door.
-Hey, hey, hey.

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:51.625
Open the door. Open the door.

01:26:51.708 --> 01:26:53.791
-There you go.
-[grunts]

01:26:53.875 --> 01:26:55.958
[Kincaid screaming]

01:26:56.041 --> 01:26:57.916
-Man, come on, man. Hey, look.
-[Kincaid whimpering]

01:26:58.000 --> 01:26:59.333
We're not gonna hurt you.

01:26:59.416 --> 01:27:01.750
Well, we will, but we don't want to,
so don't make us. Over there.

01:27:01.833 --> 01:27:03.708
-Go, go, go, go, go.
-Okay.

01:27:03.791 --> 01:27:07.125
Please, Parker, I'm-I'm begging you,
and-and gentleman. I-I-I--

01:27:07.208 --> 01:27:09.541
Shh. I just need you to tell me
who's getting The Lady of Arintero.

01:27:09.625 --> 01:27:11.875
I got, I got a big deal coming in.

01:27:11.958 --> 01:27:13.666
And it's a crypto thing,
and I'll cut you in--

01:27:13.750 --> 01:27:15.333
The buyer, Kincaid, who is it?

01:27:16.625 --> 01:27:18.458
I'll tell you. Just don't do it.

01:27:18.541 --> 01:27:19.625
Don't do what?

01:27:19.708 --> 01:27:21.125
Don't throw me off the building.

01:27:21.208 --> 01:27:23.125
Throw you off the building?
Why would I do that?

01:27:23.208 --> 01:27:24.208
Because you did it before!

01:27:24.291 --> 01:27:25.541
You dropped me out the window,
and now look at me.

01:27:25.625 --> 01:27:27.666
-I'm a fucking mess.
-Look, calm down. I promise, okay?

01:27:27.750 --> 01:27:29.041
I'm not gonna throw you off the building.

01:27:29.125 --> 01:27:31.375
But I think that you will, though.

01:27:31.458 --> 01:27:32.708
No. I promise.

01:27:32.791 --> 01:27:34.833
I don't believe you, like, at all.

01:27:34.916 --> 01:27:36.625
No, I won't. I promise you.

01:27:36.708 --> 01:27:38.250
What happened to Terry?

01:27:38.333 --> 01:27:39.500
What did you do to him?

01:27:39.583 --> 01:27:40.958
-Who's Terry?
-He's wasting our time.

01:27:41.041 --> 01:27:42.833
The motherfucker we threw
off the goddamn building.

01:27:42.916 --> 01:27:45.041
-[Kincaid stammers]
-I mean-- Ah, shit.

01:27:45.125 --> 01:27:46.125
[stammers] You threw--

01:27:46.208 --> 01:27:47.875
-Hey, hey, hey!
-Now you've done it.

01:27:47.958 --> 01:27:48.958
-[Grofield] Come on, man.
-[groans]

01:27:49.041 --> 01:27:50.916
Shit. This is going nowhere.

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:52.500
-What the fuck would you do that for?
-I don't fucking know.

01:27:52.583 --> 01:27:54.291
I thought I was just telling him
the goddamn truth.

01:27:54.375 --> 01:27:55.500
Hey, you.

01:27:55.583 --> 01:27:57.500
You wouldn't happen to know
where the fucking--

01:27:57.583 --> 01:28:00.000
who the buyer is
for the goddamn Lady, would you?

01:28:00.083 --> 01:28:01.083
Yeah, sure.

01:28:01.166 --> 01:28:02.875
[intriguing music playing]

01:28:02.958 --> 01:28:03.958
What?

01:28:04.041 --> 01:28:06.125
It's all these dickheads ever talk about.

01:28:06.208 --> 01:28:07.625
It's that asshole billionaire, you know?

01:28:07.708 --> 01:28:09.958
What, asshole billionaire? I think
you're gonna have to narrow that down.

01:28:10.041 --> 01:28:12.375
Um, what's his name?

01:28:12.458 --> 01:28:13.750
[stammers, sighs]

01:28:16.083 --> 01:28:18.166
Phineas Paul. That's the one.

01:28:18.250 --> 01:28:19.083
-Wow.
-Huh.

01:28:19.166 --> 01:28:20.916
-They're selling that lady thing to him.
-[Grofield] Damn.

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:22.125
-Mm-hmm.
-That was easy as fuck.

01:28:22.208 --> 01:28:23.750
-Yeah, seriously, thank you.
-[chuckles]

01:28:23.833 --> 01:28:25.250
-[chuckles] Yeah.
-[Grofield] Well, guy like that

01:28:25.333 --> 01:28:26.541
gonna be hard to find.

01:28:26.625 --> 01:28:28.541
Well, you could try Valentino's, actually.

01:28:28.625 --> 01:28:31.083
He just posted this picture of his steak.

01:28:31.166 --> 01:28:32.958
It looks juicy.

01:28:33.041 --> 01:28:35.166
Wow.

01:28:35.250 --> 01:28:36.875
-Come on.
-You're a helpful little motherfuck--

01:28:36.958 --> 01:28:38.833
-Hey.
-Sorry for pointing this thing. Thank you.

01:28:38.916 --> 01:28:41.458
-You're welcome. [chuckles]
-[chuckles] Jesus.

01:28:41.541 --> 01:28:44.333

01:30:37.875 --> 01:30:40.875

I can show you on a map, but--

01:30:43.541 --> 01:30:45.250
Oh, great.
Now we got to fuck with a map, man!

01:30:45.333 --> 01:30:46.458

-[Parker] Hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:30:48.416 --> 01:30:49.416
Grofield, calm down.

01:30:49.500 --> 01:30:51.166
You said "but." You said "but." But what?

01:30:51.250 --> 01:30:52.708
That was good.

01:30:52.791 --> 01:30:53.791
You won't be able to get her.

01:30:53.875 --> 01:30:56.000
Even if you somehow
blow the door off the vault,

01:30:56.083 --> 01:30:58.708
The Lady's protected
by a special security cage.

01:30:58.791 --> 01:31:01.166
My company actually makes them.

01:31:01.250 --> 01:31:03.583

01:31:03.666 --> 01:31:04.958
It'd take days to cut through it.

01:31:05.041 --> 01:31:09.416
Trust me, no one, not even I could
get past it until the time lock opens.

01:31:09.500 --> 01:31:10.500
When does it open?

01:31:10.583 --> 01:31:13.125
The cage opens tomorrow, 8:00 a.m.

01:31:13.208 --> 01:31:15.708

01:31:15.791 --> 01:31:18.250
Ironically, they have a website.

01:31:19.833 --> 01:31:21.291
Do you know which vault it's in?

01:31:21.375 --> 01:31:22.625
Vault one.

01:31:22.708 --> 01:31:27.375
But like I said, even if you blow the
vault, you still can't get into the cage.

01:31:27.458 --> 01:31:29.458
Believe me, it's impenetrable.

01:31:32.833 --> 01:31:34.541
