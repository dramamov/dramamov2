00:05:11.583 --> 00:05:12.416
Kneel.

00:06:16.041 --> 00:06:17.916
If they demand money upfront,
we walk.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.000
Relax.

00:06:25.833 --> 00:06:27.333
Please state your wish.

00:06:27.791 --> 00:06:31.375
You must be sincere
for the Goddess to feel your longing.

00:06:32.833 --> 00:06:34.666
My daughter was tortured 3 years ago.

00:06:35.125 --> 00:06:36.791
Now she's in a coma.

00:06:37.791 --> 00:06:39.958
Is there a way to wake her up?

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:41.458
Impossible.

00:06:41.541 --> 00:06:44.333
Your daughter's still alive.
There's nothing we can do.

00:06:44.416 --> 00:06:46.666
But aside from being able to breathe,

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:48.666
she's as good as dead.

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:53.166
There's a line between life and death.
Your daughter hasn't crossed it yet.

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:55.291
The living can't be resurrected.

00:07:00.375 --> 00:07:02.500
My daughter was killed three years ago.

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:05.083
Where is your daughter's body now?

00:08:04.541 --> 00:08:07.541
The body of the deceased is damaged.
To be resurrected,

00:08:07.625 --> 00:08:09.708
the body must remain intact.

00:08:15.541 --> 00:08:17.500
I actually believed it for a moment.

00:08:19.083 --> 00:08:21.750
It's okay, we'll find someone else.

00:08:35.166 --> 00:08:37.541
Has it been a tiring few days?

00:08:37.625 --> 00:08:38.458
No.

00:08:38.541 --> 00:08:39.875
Let's go inside.

00:08:57.791 --> 00:08:59.166
Hey. Chao Ching!

00:09:00.875 --> 00:09:02.750
Over there. Over there.

00:09:09.791 --> 00:09:12.708
It's been seven days. Are you ready?

00:09:14.125 --> 00:09:15.083
Yes.

00:09:15.166 --> 00:09:17.000
Thank you for your grace, Goddess.

00:09:17.708 --> 00:09:19.208
Bid farewell to him.

00:09:21.833 --> 00:09:22.666
Son.

00:09:24.625 --> 00:09:26.583
- Did you enjoy your time with us?
- Yes.

00:09:27.416 --> 00:09:28.250
We're you happy?

00:09:29.166 --> 00:09:30.958
We can't be with you anymore.

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:34.416
You'll be my son in the next life, okay?

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:35.333
Okay.

00:09:36.875 --> 00:09:38.041
My darling.

00:09:42.291 --> 00:09:45.708
We're so glad we could see you again.

00:09:46.416 --> 00:09:48.541
Thank you for coming.

00:09:48.625 --> 00:09:50.125
We love you…

00:09:54.083 --> 00:09:55.750
So much.

00:09:55.833 --> 00:09:56.958
You know that.

00:10:49.541 --> 00:10:52.750
Chang Shih-kai’s gang
has defrauded people for years.

00:10:52.833 --> 00:10:56.208
{\an8}His syndicate lures young women
from China, Taiwan

00:10:56.291 --> 00:10:59.375
{\an8}and Hong Kong to Southeast Asia
and forces them

00:10:59.458 --> 00:11:02.333
{\an8}into illegal phone scam operations
through captivity,

00:11:02.416 --> 00:11:04.166
{\an8}torture and sexual assault.

00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:07.458
The numbers involved in
these horrific crimes are still unclear.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.250
Five years ago, Southeast Asian police
raided the syndicate's base

00:11:11.333 --> 00:11:12.750
in a special operation.

00:11:12.833 --> 00:11:15.375
The main suspect,
Chang Shih-kai, was extradited

00:11:15.458 --> 00:11:17.041
to face trial, but jumped bail,

00:11:17.125 --> 00:11:18.541
absconding to Southeast Asia.

00:11:18.625 --> 00:11:20.875
While in hiding,
due to an assault charge,

00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:22.791
Chang Shih-kai was arrested again.

00:11:23.583 --> 00:11:27.208
Over 40 family members
of Taiwanese victims united

00:11:27.291 --> 00:11:31.625
to initiate criminal and civil lawsuits
against Chang Shih-kai in Southeast Asia

00:11:31.708 --> 00:11:34.291
led by three mothers, Huang I-chen,

00:11:34.375 --> 00:11:35.958
Chao Ching and Wang Hui-chun.

00:11:36.708 --> 00:11:39.250
As this case's attorney
and a victim's mother,

00:11:39.333 --> 00:11:42.791
I urge the judge
to impose the death penalty

00:11:42.875 --> 00:11:45.500
for human trafficking,
torture, murder and rape,

00:11:45.583 --> 00:11:47.250
rather than a fraud sentence.

00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:49.833
After an overruled first trial

00:11:49.916 --> 00:11:52.083
{\an8}and a 20-year sentence in the second,

00:11:52.166 --> 00:11:56.208
{\an8}the long awaited verdict has finally
been reached. The death penalty.

00:11:56.291 --> 00:11:59.000
{\an8}Listen, this wasn't just
a simple case of fraud.

00:11:59.083 --> 00:12:00.583
{\an8}- People actually died.
- Right.

00:12:00.666 --> 00:12:02.500
{\an8}One young girl, when found,

00:12:02.583 --> 00:12:04.583
{\an8}had been abused beyond recognition.

00:12:04.666 --> 00:12:05.791
{\an8}- And another girl.
- Yes.

00:12:05.875 --> 00:12:06.708
{\an8}How was she?

00:12:06.791 --> 00:12:09.333
{\an8}- In a vegetative state.
- In a vegetative state.

00:12:09.416 --> 00:12:10.875
Her life has been destroyed.

00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:13.125
Her family must care for her forever.

00:12:13.208 --> 00:12:15.291
- Imagine their pain.
- The hardship.

00:12:15.375 --> 00:12:17.916
So Chang Shih-kai is utterly evil.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:18.833
Without a doubt.

00:12:18.916 --> 00:12:22.250
Let’s focus on the fraud case
that shocked Taiwan five years ago.

00:12:22.333 --> 00:12:24.750
Mr. Chang
will be executed in Benkha tomorrow…

00:12:24.833 --> 00:12:26.166
- She's here!
- Ms. Chao.

00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:27.875
Ms. Chao, are you going alone?

00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:29.291
Are you going to Benkha?

00:12:29.375 --> 00:12:31.625
Did Chang Shih-kai's family contact you?

00:12:31.708 --> 00:12:34.541
How do you feel about the outcome?

00:12:34.625 --> 00:12:36.166
Can you say a few words?

00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:37.750
Mrs. Chang.

00:12:37.833 --> 00:12:39.166
Can you give a response?

00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:40.541
Can you say a few words?

00:12:47.666 --> 00:12:48.500
Don't worry.

00:12:50.666 --> 00:12:52.208
After my son dies,

00:12:53.916 --> 00:12:56.208
I will take responsibility for his sins.

00:13:07.708 --> 00:13:09.791
The Suspect's family…

00:13:09.875 --> 00:13:11.916
How will you take responsibility?

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.541
Can you say a few words?

00:13:13.625 --> 00:13:15.250
Is this apology too late?

00:13:15.333 --> 00:13:16.375
Can you forgive her?

00:13:16.916 --> 00:13:20.750
The only thing that's kept me going
these past five years,

00:13:20.833 --> 00:13:22.833
is your support and donations.

00:13:22.916 --> 00:13:24.541
Thank you so much.

00:13:24.625 --> 00:13:28.333
Jin Jin used to share
many happy memories with you

00:13:28.416 --> 00:13:30.958
on this YouTube channel.

00:13:31.041 --> 00:13:33.500
So starting today,

00:13:33.583 --> 00:13:39.958
I will face life with a positive attitude.

00:13:40.916 --> 00:13:42.833
I truly believe that someday

00:13:42.916 --> 00:13:44.500
Jin Jin will wake up.

00:13:46.875 --> 00:13:50.333
By the way,
let me share some good news with you.

00:13:50.416 --> 00:13:51.833
Thanks to your donations,

00:13:51.916 --> 00:13:55.625
I've almost raised enough money
for the medical flight.

00:13:56.625 --> 00:13:59.291
Soon, I can take Jin Jin back to Taipei.

00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:07.708
Jin Jin.

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:10.500
We'll be home soon.

00:14:20.708 --> 00:14:22.166
{\an8}HOW MUCH DID THE STREAM MAKE?

00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:23.416
{\an8}SHOW YOUR BANK ACCOUNT

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:24.416
{\an8}SHAMEFUL BEGGAR!

00:14:27.833 --> 00:14:29.125
WILL SHE SPEND IT ON HER?

00:14:29.208 --> 00:14:30.291
ON WHAT IF NOT HER?

00:14:30.375 --> 00:14:31.541
YOU'RE TRULY PATHETIC!

00:14:31.625 --> 00:14:32.458
SHAMEFUL?

00:14:51.041 --> 00:14:52.041
Excuse me.

00:14:52.666 --> 00:14:53.500
I'm sorry.

00:14:53.583 --> 00:14:55.000
- One more?
- Yeah, one more.

00:14:55.791 --> 00:14:56.875
Thank you.

00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:02.416
I also want one.

00:15:03.083 --> 00:15:04.125
And I want this one.

00:15:12.166 --> 00:15:14.416
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

00:15:43.666 --> 00:15:44.666
Let me help you.

00:16:00.375 --> 00:16:01.208
Hurry up.

00:16:16.458 --> 00:16:17.625
Do you see the car?

00:16:18.416 --> 00:16:19.250
That one.

00:16:19.333 --> 00:16:21.083
- That black car?
- Yes.

00:16:21.791 --> 00:16:22.791
Follow it.

00:16:24.458 --> 00:16:25.541
Okay.

00:16:56.166 --> 00:16:57.166
I woke you up.

00:16:57.250 --> 00:16:58.625
Sorry I'm late.

00:16:58.708 --> 00:16:59.583
Hi, Eason.

00:17:05.583 --> 00:17:07.041
Grandma, I'm back.

00:17:07.958 --> 00:17:09.333
I bought congee for you.

00:17:10.166 --> 00:17:11.416
From the shop you like.

00:17:12.416 --> 00:17:13.458
Those are for you.

00:17:15.125 --> 00:17:16.041
For Jin Jin.

00:17:18.416 --> 00:17:19.458
Thank you.

00:17:19.541 --> 00:17:20.375
Sure.

00:17:21.541 --> 00:17:22.958
- I'll be going, then.
- Okay.

00:17:40.833 --> 00:17:44.125
- Did you change the passcode?
- Can you not smoke in the hospital?

00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:47.875
I saw your livestream fundraiser.

00:17:47.958 --> 00:17:48.791
How's it going?

00:17:48.875 --> 00:17:50.958
- Do you have enough?
- Not your business.

00:17:51.041 --> 00:17:52.750
How is it not my business?

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000
Have you asked about the medical flight?

00:17:59.625 --> 00:18:01.333
Yeah, I contacted them today.

00:18:02.166 --> 00:18:04.333
It's just that last time…

00:18:07.083 --> 00:18:08.541
Didn't the doctor ask us

00:18:09.250 --> 00:18:10.250
if we'd considered…

00:18:11.958 --> 00:18:13.208
stopping life support?

00:18:14.291 --> 00:18:15.416
She can't hear me.

00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:16.583
She's your daughter.

00:18:16.666 --> 00:18:18.166
Yes, she's my daughter,

00:18:18.250 --> 00:18:19.791
so I want her pain to end.

00:18:19.875 --> 00:18:21.750
- Lower your voice.
- Why should I?

00:18:21.833 --> 00:18:25.000
What can she do back home like that?
Can we afford her care?

00:18:26.666 --> 00:18:28.791
You've already raised ten million NTD.

00:18:28.875 --> 00:18:30.000
Think about it, okay?

00:18:30.083 --> 00:18:33.041
What will we do
once we've spent it on a medical flight?

00:18:33.125 --> 00:18:36.333
Imagine if we invested the money
or bought some property…

00:18:36.416 --> 00:18:37.875
Shh. Keep it down.

00:18:37.958 --> 00:18:40.208
Sorry. Are you helping her
or tormenting her?

00:18:40.291 --> 00:18:41.791
How dare you.

00:18:43.291 --> 00:18:45.500
- You okay?
- This is none of your business.

00:18:46.958 --> 00:18:49.708
How is it none of my business?
I donated money too.

00:18:49.791 --> 00:18:52.375
To get Jin Jin home,
not buy you a property.

00:18:52.458 --> 00:18:55.083
I'm thinking of Hui-chun's future.

00:18:55.166 --> 00:18:56.458
And when the money's gone?

00:18:56.541 --> 00:18:59.125
Or are you still pursuing civil damages?

00:18:59.208 --> 00:19:01.041
It'll never happen, okay?

00:19:01.125 --> 00:19:03.250
- I-chen said we have a chance.
- Her again.

00:19:03.333 --> 00:19:04.375
Did she win?

00:19:04.458 --> 00:19:07.750
He got the death penalty.
It won't be easy getting your money.

00:19:07.833 --> 00:19:09.625
Is it easier to kill your own daughter?

00:19:15.416 --> 00:19:19.208
I'm talking about
stopping life support, not killing her.

00:19:20.083 --> 00:19:21.375
You're nuts.

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:46.791
Are you okay?

00:19:46.875 --> 00:19:48.041
I'm fine.

00:19:48.583 --> 00:19:49.875
I don't understand.

00:19:49.958 --> 00:19:52.041
Why haven't you divorced him already?

00:19:52.666 --> 00:19:55.125
At least he still pays
for my living expenses.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.875
Come on.
Let's get your luggage home.

00:19:58.875 --> 00:19:59.708
Hey.

00:20:00.458 --> 00:20:01.291
Look.

00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:06.458
Chang I-ting just posted this.

00:20:09.125 --> 00:20:10.833
An icon.

00:20:10.916 --> 00:20:12.500
She must still be here.

00:20:17.416 --> 00:20:19.666
_77CHRISTINA, POST

00:20:23.458 --> 00:20:25.791
This place is huge,
how will we find her?

00:20:27.041 --> 00:20:29.291
She must have taken the photo from here.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.000
Hey, look.

00:20:34.666 --> 00:20:35.750
A new photo.

00:20:47.083 --> 00:20:47.916
Hey.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.208
Her son's dying tomorrow
and she's still shopping.

00:21:48.125 --> 00:21:50.166
Did you see what I sent you?

00:21:50.875 --> 00:21:52.708
I did. What about it?

00:21:52.791 --> 00:21:54.541
Chang Shih-kai's family is so rich,

00:21:54.625 --> 00:21:56.958
yet he's got no assets
to pay civil damages.

00:21:57.041 --> 00:21:58.166
Isn't that strange?

00:21:58.250 --> 00:21:59.083
Right.

00:21:59.166 --> 00:22:02.916
They spent more in one store today
than the damages they owe us.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.000
Chang Shih-kai is not his family.

00:22:05.083 --> 00:22:07.291
The court already checked his assets.

00:22:07.375 --> 00:22:10.291
He has no assets in his name
that can be enforced against.

00:22:10.375 --> 00:22:11.958
So he must've transferred them.

00:22:12.041 --> 00:22:15.041
- The law requires evidence.
- Then find some evidence.

00:22:15.791 --> 00:22:18.583
We're going to seek
enforcement from the court again.

00:22:18.666 --> 00:22:20.791
What can we do now, I-chen?

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.916
Do you think I never looked into this?

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.750
The problem is, there's no evidence

00:22:26.833 --> 00:22:29.916
of direct financial transactions
between him and his family.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.625
Usually in telecom fraud,

00:22:31.708 --> 00:22:33.750
the internal structure is very clear.

00:22:33.833 --> 00:22:36.333
They have a waterproof
money laundering process

00:22:36.416 --> 00:22:38.000
that involves overseas capital.

00:22:38.083 --> 00:22:40.166
To trace the flow of his funds

00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:43.458
and provide evidence to court,
will take a very long time.

00:22:43.541 --> 00:22:45.708
How many times must I explain this?

00:22:45.791 --> 00:22:48.375
So you already knew
he had hidden assets elsewhere.

00:22:48.458 --> 00:22:50.916
Yes. That's why I told you to stop.

00:22:58.208 --> 00:22:59.791
I do want to help you.

00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:01.666
It's just that

00:23:02.333 --> 00:23:05.125
you have three or four months
of unsettled bills.

00:23:05.708 --> 00:23:08.416
The firm's really on my back right now.

00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:10.916
If you seek enforcement
from the court again,

00:23:11.375 --> 00:23:12.916
that will cost even more.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.708
It's not a small amount.
I can't help you.

00:23:15.791 --> 00:23:17.791
You're afraid we can't pay you?

00:23:19.833 --> 00:23:20.666
Meeting time.

00:23:22.333 --> 00:23:23.958
When he was extradited to Taiwan,

00:23:24.041 --> 00:23:26.458
how long would he have got
just for telecom fraud?

00:23:26.541 --> 00:23:30.125
Who found out he was arrested overseas
and filed a murder charge?

00:23:30.208 --> 00:23:33.416
Who's been talking to local lawyers

00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:36.375
and handling informants all these years?
It was me.

00:23:36.458 --> 00:23:39.916
Do you think I barely lifted a finger
getting him this sentence?

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.791
Of course not, I-chen.
That's not what we meant.

00:23:42.875 --> 00:23:44.666
We know you've done a lot for us.

00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:47.125
Anyway, Chang will be executed tomorrow.

00:23:47.208 --> 00:23:50.125
Unless he admits
his mother's assets are connected to him,

00:23:50.208 --> 00:23:52.166
you won't get any civil damages.

00:23:53.875 --> 00:23:56.708
I understand you have mixed feelings.

00:23:56.791 --> 00:23:59.125
This would be my professional advice.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:01.833
Trust me.

00:24:02.458 --> 00:24:04.125
I'm on your side.

00:24:04.208 --> 00:24:05.791
Yes. So--

00:24:05.875 --> 00:24:07.458
Sorry, I'm off to a meeting.

00:24:17.250 --> 00:24:19.125
She's not even coming tomorrow.

00:24:19.208 --> 00:24:21.125
And she says she's on our side.

00:24:22.833 --> 00:24:24.541
It's understandable.

00:24:24.625 --> 00:24:26.125
She's not like us.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.458
If I were her,

00:24:30.333 --> 00:24:32.875
maybe I wouldn't want
to face all this either.

00:24:52.125 --> 00:24:52.958
Pong?

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:56.833
Pong?

00:24:58.875 --> 00:24:59.916
Pong.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.208
- I'm back.
- Hi.

00:25:02.291 --> 00:25:03.708
Sorry, I'm late.

00:25:03.791 --> 00:25:06.041
It's okay. We're not busy today.

00:25:06.125 --> 00:25:07.583
Not many customers.

00:25:10.875 --> 00:25:11.958
Where's your husband?

00:25:12.833 --> 00:25:16.666
He said the bed's too small here,
so he's staying at a hotel nearby.

00:25:18.541 --> 00:25:20.083
Hey, Hui-chun.

00:25:20.166 --> 00:25:21.125
Hui-chun.

00:25:21.208 --> 00:25:22.208
Hui-chun, sorry.

00:25:23.666 --> 00:25:25.958
The door. The door is locked.

00:25:30.083 --> 00:25:31.625
Don't close the door.

00:25:31.708 --> 00:25:33.375
Keep outside.

00:25:33.458 --> 00:25:35.208
It's too cold, you'll die inside.

00:25:35.291 --> 00:25:36.125
I'm sorry.

00:25:36.875 --> 00:25:38.375
Sorry, let me take care of it.

00:25:38.833 --> 00:25:41.166
I'll do it later. Go back to your store.

00:25:41.708 --> 00:25:42.791
Thank you.

00:25:44.791 --> 00:25:46.916
- Do you need help?
- It's okay.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:48.041
Hey, Pong.

00:25:50.083 --> 00:25:50.916
Go.

00:25:52.125 --> 00:25:53.208
See you later.

00:26:00.958 --> 00:26:02.500
Does he help out often?

00:26:02.583 --> 00:26:05.875
Yes, good thing he's here.
I'd be exhausted going back and forth.

00:26:05.958 --> 00:26:07.583
- True.
- Come on.

00:26:17.125 --> 00:26:17.958
Three minutes.

00:26:19.041 --> 00:26:20.041
Three minutes?

00:26:20.125 --> 00:26:23.541
Didn't we agree on 10 minutes?
Why is it 3 minutes now?

00:26:24.041 --> 00:26:26.625
He's on death row.

00:26:26.708 --> 00:26:29.416
If this gets exposed, I'll be in trouble.

00:26:33.583 --> 00:26:34.583
How about this?

00:26:35.958 --> 00:26:39.291
I'll up the money.
Give us five minutes. Okay?

00:26:45.166 --> 00:26:46.166
Five minutes.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.000
Five minutes.

00:26:52.458 --> 00:26:53.958
That's all I could get.

00:26:55.166 --> 00:26:56.041
Fine.

00:27:03.833 --> 00:27:06.125
Chang Shih-kai is to be executed today.

00:27:06.208 --> 00:27:10.375
A lot of the victims' family members
are attending. Let's see how they feel.

00:27:10.458 --> 00:27:14.500
After a whole year, they will finally see
justice being served.

00:27:14.583 --> 00:27:15.666
They've arrived.

00:27:16.916 --> 00:27:18.208
Any comments?

00:30:02.958 --> 00:30:04.458
That's it?

00:30:21.375 --> 00:30:22.416
I'm going outside.

00:30:38.125 --> 00:30:39.708
When we found her,

00:30:40.291 --> 00:30:42.166
she was locked in a cage.

00:30:42.833 --> 00:30:44.625
There was no sign of life.

00:30:45.375 --> 00:30:48.375
She has injuries all over her body.

00:30:49.416 --> 00:30:51.958
She's been treated incredibly inhumanely.

00:30:52.541 --> 00:30:55.458
Signs of electric shocks,
impact from hard objects

00:30:55.541 --> 00:30:56.708
and whip lashes.

00:30:57.541 --> 00:30:58.958
But none of them fatal.

00:30:59.875 --> 00:31:03.208
Our initial findings
are that she died from septic shock.

00:31:04.416 --> 00:31:06.958
Prolonged submersion underwater

00:31:07.041 --> 00:31:09.750
caused the severe skin ulcerations
on her lower body.

00:31:11.291 --> 00:31:12.375
Also,

00:31:12.458 --> 00:31:13.291
her genital area

00:31:14.666 --> 00:31:16.291
exhibits signs of laceration.

00:31:45.833 --> 00:31:47.416
Was she tortured to death?

00:31:48.541 --> 00:31:49.541
You could say that.

00:32:14.791 --> 00:32:18.041
She won't say a word
because she is scared.

00:32:19.083 --> 00:32:21.875
Ms. Chao, please have a seat.
You're next.

00:32:28.625 --> 00:32:29.458
Sit.

00:32:33.208 --> 00:32:35.041
Why were you in Benkha?

00:32:36.583 --> 00:32:37.791
On vacation.

00:32:41.250 --> 00:32:42.083
An Chi.

00:32:42.166 --> 00:32:43.083
An Chi, here.

00:32:43.166 --> 00:32:44.625
Have some tissues.

00:32:45.375 --> 00:32:46.208
Here.

00:32:46.291 --> 00:32:47.958
I'm here, you're okay.

00:32:48.041 --> 00:32:49.166
It's okay.

00:32:49.250 --> 00:32:50.250
Come on.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.458
An Chi, listen to me.

00:32:55.541 --> 00:32:57.208
It's okay, go get in the car.

00:32:57.291 --> 00:32:58.291
Take her there.

00:33:01.333 --> 00:33:05.041
Sorry, my daughter's not mentally fit
to make a statement today.

00:33:05.125 --> 00:33:06.500
We'll come back another day.

00:33:07.916 --> 00:33:09.000
I'm a lawyer.

00:33:10.541 --> 00:33:12.083
I can also provide assistance.

00:33:13.625 --> 00:33:16.458
Okay, come with me and make a statement.

00:33:16.541 --> 00:33:17.375
Okay.

00:33:17.916 --> 00:33:19.083
This is her mother.

00:33:23.416 --> 00:33:27.083
Ms. Chao, you can come to me
with any legal questions.

00:33:27.166 --> 00:33:28.541
I'll do my best to help.

00:33:29.666 --> 00:33:31.125
We're on the same side.

00:33:31.958 --> 00:33:33.000
I'm sorry.

00:33:36.125 --> 00:33:37.125
Please have a seat.

00:33:39.166 --> 00:33:40.958
- Can you speak English?
- Yes.

00:33:41.041 --> 00:33:41.958
Use English.

00:33:46.291 --> 00:33:47.291
Ms. Chao.

00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:50.583
We found videos of a hostage being
tortured at the scene.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:54.583
We need you to confirm
if it's your daughter in the video.

00:33:56.375 --> 00:33:57.208
Ms. Chao.

00:33:58.791 --> 00:34:02.083
Identifying the victim in the video
is really important.

00:34:02.708 --> 00:34:05.458
It will have a direct impact
on the upcoming trials.

00:34:06.791 --> 00:34:07.750
Ms. Chao.

00:34:08.625 --> 00:34:10.000
Ms. Chao, did you hear me?

00:34:10.083 --> 00:34:11.375
Can I verify it for her?

00:34:12.208 --> 00:34:13.333
Ms. Chao.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.041
Hey.

00:34:33.083 --> 00:34:36.416
Sit up. Still wanna run away?

00:34:39.250 --> 00:34:41.208
- I won't run away again.
- You won't?

00:34:41.291 --> 00:34:43.583
- I promise.
- You promise?

00:34:45.458 --> 00:34:46.583
Talk to your mom.

00:34:48.083 --> 00:34:49.458
Say it.

00:34:50.583 --> 00:34:53.750
Mom, please save me!

00:34:54.625 --> 00:34:57.958
Mom, save me!

00:35:00.708 --> 00:35:02.083
Say it now.

00:35:02.166 --> 00:35:03.541
Mom.

00:35:04.083 --> 00:35:04.916
That's enough.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:05.916
Help me.

00:35:21.750 --> 00:35:23.041
It's Hsin-yi.

00:35:39.541 --> 00:35:42.500
How do you feel after
witnessing Chang Shih-kai's execution?

00:35:42.750 --> 00:35:44.458
How do you feel about his death?

00:35:46.333 --> 00:35:47.625
Any response?

00:35:49.375 --> 00:35:52.458
Do you believe the perpetrator
got the punishment he deserved?

00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:01.041
The punishment he deserved?

00:36:02.166 --> 00:36:04.333
He tormented my daughter so badly.

00:36:04.416 --> 00:36:05.958
Was this punishment deserved?

00:36:06.041 --> 00:36:07.958
- Was justice served?
- Did you want this?

00:36:08.041 --> 00:36:09.625
What punishment
do you think should be served?)

00:36:09.708 --> 00:36:10.916
Do you have a daughter?

00:36:12.083 --> 00:36:16.250
Do you know how much my daughter
suffered before she died?

00:36:17.750 --> 00:36:21.125
You know the death penalty
is just another form of murder, right?

00:36:24.041 --> 00:36:24.875
Miss!

00:36:24.958 --> 00:36:26.583
I'm Hsu Yung, from Super News.

00:36:26.666 --> 00:36:29.708
I'm doing an exclusive on fraud
from the victims' perspective.

00:36:29.791 --> 00:36:33.416
I know it's too soon, but contact me
any time you're in Taiwan.

00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:34.416
You're leaving?

00:36:59.125 --> 00:37:01.875
- When are you going back to Taipei?
- Tomorrow.

00:37:19.750 --> 00:37:20.750
What's the matter?

00:37:22.166 --> 00:37:25.541
Jin Jin's caregiver is quitting.
She's not coming tomorrow.

00:37:27.208 --> 00:37:28.875
Can't you find a replacement?

00:37:30.208 --> 00:37:31.750
It's not that easy.

00:37:32.291 --> 00:37:34.041
In Jin Jin's current condition,

00:37:34.625 --> 00:37:36.666
no caregivers want the job.

00:37:36.750 --> 00:37:38.958
Or they put the price up.

00:37:42.125 --> 00:37:44.583
Most importantly,
that bastard is dead.

00:37:45.208 --> 00:37:47.875
I'll never get any civil damages now.

00:37:51.583 --> 00:37:53.250
What will you do next?

00:37:55.250 --> 00:37:56.875
I'll take it one step at a time.

00:38:00.083 --> 00:38:02.333
You like that? Welcome.

00:38:03.458 --> 00:38:05.958
Not like we've got anywhere to go.
Want a drink?

00:38:06.708 --> 00:38:08.333
- Looks pretty sleazy.
- Welcome.

00:38:08.416 --> 00:38:09.416
Let's go home.

00:38:10.125 --> 00:38:11.083
Don't worry.

00:38:11.166 --> 00:38:13.416
Only Chinese scam other Chinese here.

00:38:14.958 --> 00:38:16.166
Have fun.

00:38:51.458 --> 00:38:52.500
Want to sit outside?

00:39:19.833 --> 00:39:21.041
I mean,

00:39:21.125 --> 00:39:23.625
Chang Shih-kai was scamming people here.

00:39:24.666 --> 00:39:27.166
Did his family
really know nothing about it?

00:39:27.250 --> 00:39:29.125
Were they really not involved?

00:39:29.208 --> 00:39:30.541
What if they were?

00:39:31.166 --> 00:39:32.333
He's dead now.

00:39:32.416 --> 00:39:34.041
And we have no proof.

00:39:38.625 --> 00:39:39.708
I thought

00:39:41.125 --> 00:39:44.791
that once Chang Shih-kai was dead,
it would all be over

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:47.833
and we could start anew.

00:39:49.541 --> 00:39:50.875
But now,

00:39:51.958 --> 00:39:54.166
I have zero sense of relief.

00:39:56.250 --> 00:39:57.416
How could he…

00:39:59.875 --> 00:40:02.041
How could he die with so much dignity?

00:40:20.250 --> 00:40:21.083
Get up.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:23.583
Sit up.

00:40:33.916 --> 00:40:34.958
Still wanna run away?

00:40:37.333 --> 00:40:38.500
I won't run away again.

00:40:39.041 --> 00:40:40.875
- You won't?
- I promise.

00:40:40.958 --> 00:40:41.791
You promise?

00:40:44.291 --> 00:40:46.500
Say it.

00:40:47.750 --> 00:40:51.750
Mom, please save me!

00:40:51.833 --> 00:40:55.041
Mom, save me!

00:40:56.666 --> 00:40:58.416
Film her! Why are you filming me?

00:41:03.083 --> 00:41:04.125
Get closer.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:17.125
Hsin-yi's mom,

00:41:17.708 --> 00:41:18.791
prepare the money.

00:41:19.958 --> 00:41:21.583
I'll record more videos for you.

00:41:33.875 --> 00:41:35.208
Why did you kill Hsin-yi?

00:41:36.625 --> 00:41:38.375
She suffered more than anyone.

00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:41.041
Why did you target her?

00:41:47.041 --> 00:41:48.416
Fucking speak!

00:41:51.875 --> 00:41:55.708
Compared to what he did to Hsin-yi,

00:41:57.583 --> 00:41:59.250
he died such an easy death.

00:42:00.291 --> 00:42:03.333
When we found her,
she was locked in a cage.

00:42:05.166 --> 00:42:07.458
She has injuries all over her body.

00:42:09.125 --> 00:42:12.416
Signs of electric shocks,
impact from hard objects

00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:13.333
and whip lashes.

00:42:14.583 --> 00:42:17.625
Her genital area
exhibits signs of laceration.

00:43:00.166 --> 00:43:02.000
You spent all that money to see me

00:43:03.041 --> 00:43:04.833
just to ask me that?

00:43:10.625 --> 00:43:11.625
I think…

00:43:14.333 --> 00:43:15.708
that since she's dead,

00:43:17.541 --> 00:43:19.625
you should save the money for the living.

00:43:22.916 --> 00:43:24.875
Why does it feel like the death penalty

00:43:24.958 --> 00:43:28.625
wasn't a punishment for Chang Shih-kai,

00:43:29.416 --> 00:43:30.833
but a reward?

00:43:32.458 --> 00:43:34.041
You think once you're dead,

00:43:35.541 --> 00:43:36.916
it will all be over?

00:43:38.875 --> 00:43:40.125
It won't.

00:43:40.875 --> 00:43:42.583
They must pay for what they did.

00:43:51.166 --> 00:43:52.500
We can resurrect him.

00:43:55.666 --> 00:43:57.541
If what we saw back then was real…

00:44:01.625 --> 00:44:03.833
we can resurrect him for seven days.

00:44:06.833 --> 00:44:08.583
Let's use those seven days

00:44:09.333 --> 00:44:11.083
to get the justice we deserve.

00:44:20.875 --> 00:44:22.541
An eye for an eye.

00:44:23.625 --> 00:44:24.916
A tooth for a tooth.
