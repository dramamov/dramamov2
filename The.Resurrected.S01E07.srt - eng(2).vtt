00:00:57.958 --> 00:00:59.541
Have you seen Kai?

00:00:59.625 --> 00:01:01.750
No. Ask Pin.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.416
Pin, have you seen Kai?

00:01:07.916 --> 00:01:10.583
I saw him go up to the second floor.

00:01:12.291 --> 00:01:13.625
Out the way.

00:01:40.666 --> 00:01:41.666
Yes?

00:01:45.083 --> 00:01:46.000
I took care of it.

00:01:46.583 --> 00:01:48.916
We're going to Myanmar
tomorrow to see Yang.

00:01:50.083 --> 00:01:51.541
Okay, we'll talk later.

00:03:39.458 --> 00:03:41.708
Kai, we have a new girl.

00:04:12.333 --> 00:04:13.166
Kai.

00:04:13.666 --> 00:04:14.583
How was it?

00:04:15.208 --> 00:04:17.750
What is this shit?
I can't feel a thing.

00:04:17.833 --> 00:04:19.166
Come on.

00:04:19.708 --> 00:04:20.916
Hey, move.

00:04:23.583 --> 00:04:24.583
Try this.

00:04:25.166 --> 00:04:26.708
Supposed to be top-quality.

00:04:44.208 --> 00:04:45.208
How's that?

00:05:18.708 --> 00:05:20.125
Is it done?

00:05:20.208 --> 00:05:21.083
Not yet.

00:05:22.125 --> 00:05:23.041
What do you mean?

00:05:24.583 --> 00:05:25.750
Kai's about to come to.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:28.875
I want…

00:05:30.458 --> 00:05:32.041
…to renegotiate the price.

00:05:34.541 --> 00:05:36.000
After this is done,

00:05:36.083 --> 00:05:37.958
I might have to lie low for a while.

00:05:38.583 --> 00:05:40.666
Ten million won't cover it.

00:05:41.208 --> 00:05:42.625
How much do you want?

00:05:42.708 --> 00:05:43.833
Another ten million.

00:05:44.541 --> 00:05:46.166
Okay, see you later, bye.

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:47.083
Bye.

00:05:50.458 --> 00:05:53.583
Or I can call this off.
Make your mind up quick.

00:05:53.666 --> 00:05:55.000
He's coming around.

00:05:56.625 --> 00:05:57.541
I agree.

00:05:58.416 --> 00:06:00.916
But make sure
he doesn't leave Benkha alive.

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:02.375
I'm on it.

00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:06.208
Don't worry.
He won't be troubling you again.

00:06:12.125 --> 00:06:13.000
Who'd you mean?

00:06:17.791 --> 00:06:18.916
Chang I-ting.

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:20.333
Chang I-ting!

00:06:21.833 --> 00:06:22.833
Put that down.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.458
I don't want him dead.

00:06:27.083 --> 00:06:29.000
I just want him out the way for a bit.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.416
Your brother's so reckless.

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.833
If he gets caught again, we're screwed.

00:06:33.916 --> 00:06:35.708
Do you want to live the good life…

00:06:37.666 --> 00:06:39.500
…or end up in prison with him?

00:06:53.583 --> 00:06:55.166
What're you doing?

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:57.041
- Let go! Let go!
- Stay out of this!

00:06:57.125 --> 00:06:58.708
- Let go!
- Beat it!

00:07:01.083 --> 00:07:01.916
Shit!

00:07:26.666 --> 00:07:27.541
Hey!

00:07:30.458 --> 00:07:31.375
Hey!

00:07:39.458 --> 00:07:40.291
Grandma.

00:07:41.708 --> 00:07:43.458
Grandma, are you okay?

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:54.541
Chang Shih-kai, the main suspect
in the telecom fraud case

00:07:54.625 --> 00:07:58.166
that shocked Taiwan a year ago,
was arrested again in Southeast Asia.

00:07:58.250 --> 00:07:59.083
Before that…

00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:12.625
Have you seen the news?

00:08:12.708 --> 00:08:14.166
This is perfect.

00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:17.125
Chang Shih-kai's been arrested
for assault.

00:08:17.208 --> 00:08:19.375
This time, the victim's a Benkha local.

00:08:19.458 --> 00:08:21.083
If this is confirmed,

00:08:21.166 --> 00:08:23.625
I'm positive
I can have him tried there.

00:08:24.541 --> 00:08:27.916
But for now, the police don't seem
to have sufficient evidence.

00:08:28.625 --> 00:08:29.458
Yes.

00:08:30.708 --> 00:08:32.083
Let's talk in person later.

00:08:33.333 --> 00:08:34.958
- Are you An Chi's mother?
- Yes.

00:08:35.041 --> 00:08:36.416
Mother and baby are safe.

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:38.000
After a rest and a check-up,

00:08:38.083 --> 00:08:39.958
we'll move her to the ward.

00:08:40.041 --> 00:08:41.208
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:09:25.375 --> 00:09:26.208
Are you sure?

00:09:26.291 --> 00:09:28.291
I'm positive I saw someone else there.

00:09:28.375 --> 00:09:29.875
Calm down. This one--

00:09:31.083 --> 00:09:32.083
I understood.

00:09:33.083 --> 00:09:34.291
But apart from you,

00:09:34.375 --> 00:09:36.916
no other witnesses say they saw anyone.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.041
He'd already fled by then.
Why would I lie about this?

00:09:40.125 --> 00:09:41.750
Slow down.

00:09:41.833 --> 00:09:43.375
Calm down. Speak slowly.

00:09:43.458 --> 00:09:45.291
He's still learning the language.

00:09:45.875 --> 00:09:47.458
I said

00:09:48.041 --> 00:09:52.125
he'd already fled by then.

00:09:52.875 --> 00:09:54.000
Understand now?

00:09:54.083 --> 00:09:55.625
Not that slowly.

00:09:56.916 --> 00:09:58.708
That's not what I meant.

00:09:58.791 --> 00:10:00.416
What I meant was…

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:01.833
that…

00:10:02.708 --> 00:10:03.541
that…

00:10:05.875 --> 00:10:06.791
You talk to him.

00:10:07.291 --> 00:10:08.416
I can't be bothered.

00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:10.750
What we mean is that

00:10:10.833 --> 00:10:13.166
if you don't have any evidence

00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:16.333
linking Chang Shih-kai
to your grandma's assault,

00:10:16.416 --> 00:10:18.458
then we can only
charge him for drug use.

00:10:18.541 --> 00:10:22.291
We'll only be able to hold him
for two weeks. So think this through.

00:10:22.375 --> 00:10:25.083
Did you see Chang Shih-kai
attack your grandma or--

00:10:25.166 --> 00:10:26.500
I've told you already.

00:10:26.583 --> 00:10:28.000
I didn't see the attack.

00:10:28.083 --> 00:10:29.458
- But--
- Are you listening?

00:10:29.541 --> 00:10:31.375
Yes, but you need to stay calm.

00:10:31.458 --> 00:10:32.708
That's enough.

00:10:35.125 --> 00:10:36.333
I'm going outside.

00:10:37.083 --> 00:10:38.375
Will you arrest the--

00:10:40.041 --> 00:10:41.083
Calm down.

00:10:41.166 --> 00:10:43.083
We'll take care of it.

00:10:43.541 --> 00:10:44.750
Please, calm down.

00:10:46.583 --> 00:10:47.458
How's it going?

00:10:48.208 --> 00:10:50.708
He insists
he didn't see Chang Shih-kai do it.

00:10:50.791 --> 00:10:52.833
And that someone else was there.

00:10:52.916 --> 00:10:54.708
Probably the assailant.

00:10:56.458 --> 00:10:58.458
Or could Chang Shih-kai

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:01.250
actually be the victim here?

00:11:01.333 --> 00:11:02.291
Impossible.

00:11:03.291 --> 00:11:04.125
Chao Ching.

00:11:04.208 --> 00:11:06.833
- You can't be in here.
- Translate for me.

00:11:06.916 --> 00:11:09.916
Another person being there
doesn't clear Chang Shih-kai.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.833
They could be accomplices.
Doesn't he want to catch the attacker

00:11:12.916 --> 00:11:14.500
and help his grandma?

00:11:14.583 --> 00:11:15.458
What did you say?

00:11:16.208 --> 00:11:17.750
I can understand.

00:11:17.833 --> 00:11:18.916
He can speak Chinese?

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:22.375
Please think carefully.

00:11:22.458 --> 00:11:23.833
Maybe they both did it,

00:11:23.916 --> 00:11:26.583
but Chang Shih-kai
was too high to get away?

00:11:26.666 --> 00:11:28.416
He was out cold when I arrived.

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:29.875
He could be a victim too.

00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:31.375
No way. I know he's involved.

00:11:31.458 --> 00:11:33.041
I've already said I don't know.

00:11:33.125 --> 00:11:35.125
- I didn't see it.
- How is that possible?

00:11:35.208 --> 00:11:37.000
Why would I lie?

00:11:37.083 --> 00:11:39.625
If I saw who attacked her,
why would I lie about it?

00:11:39.708 --> 00:11:42.500
What's she trying to say?

00:11:42.583 --> 00:11:43.750
She didn't mean it.

00:11:43.833 --> 00:11:45.000
It's complicated.

00:11:45.083 --> 00:11:45.916
Speak Chinese.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.000
What are you saying?

00:11:47.083 --> 00:11:48.458
Can you speak Chinese?

00:11:48.541 --> 00:11:50.750
- Quiet.
- I'm done with my statement.

00:11:50.833 --> 00:11:52.208
Can I go now?

00:11:52.291 --> 00:11:53.833
- Okay.
- Please think carefully.

00:11:53.916 --> 00:11:55.208
- Hey. If you've…
- Please.

00:11:55.291 --> 00:11:56.250
Hey.

00:11:56.333 --> 00:11:58.791
Contact me
if you think of anything new.

00:12:08.583 --> 00:12:11.000
Hey. Hey, I… I'm sorry.

00:12:11.083 --> 00:12:13.250
I just had some things to take care of.

00:12:13.333 --> 00:12:15.041
Yeah, I'm on my way.

00:12:15.125 --> 00:12:16.958
Just send me the hotel address, okay?

00:12:19.708 --> 00:12:22.291
What is it now?
I've told you everything I know.

00:12:22.375 --> 00:12:25.041
No. I'm here to apologize.

00:12:25.916 --> 00:12:27.958
My friend was pretty fired up.

00:12:28.541 --> 00:12:29.833
Don't take it personally.

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:33.125
Hey. Actually…

00:12:34.125 --> 00:12:36.500
Actually, the person
who assaulted your grandma

00:12:36.583 --> 00:12:39.041
also assaulted our daughters.

00:12:40.666 --> 00:12:43.000
My daughter's in a coma right now.

00:12:46.416 --> 00:12:47.708
How's your grandma doing?

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.291
If you need anything, contact me.

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:56.083
I'll give you my number.

00:12:58.375 --> 00:12:59.250
Okay.

00:13:01.541 --> 00:13:02.375
Here, let me.

00:13:06.083 --> 00:13:07.208
CALL HISTORY

00:13:13.833 --> 00:13:15.916
- What's your name?
- Just call me Eason.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:16.833
Eason.

00:13:20.666 --> 00:13:22.041
My name's Wang Hui-chun.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:24.833
Okay.

00:13:31.791 --> 00:13:33.333
Based on his statement,

00:13:33.875 --> 00:13:35.958
we'll never prove
Chang Shih-kai did it.

00:13:39.666 --> 00:13:40.625
Well, then what?

00:13:41.416 --> 00:13:43.041
What'll they do with him?

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.208
If we can't charge him for assault,

00:13:46.291 --> 00:13:48.291
he'll probably be sent back to Taiwan

00:13:48.833 --> 00:13:51.166
after serving
a couple of weeks for drug use.

00:13:57.250 --> 00:13:58.166
Officer Li.

00:13:59.541 --> 00:14:01.166
Can't you think of something?

00:14:02.833 --> 00:14:04.125
There's nothing I can do.

00:14:19.791 --> 00:14:20.625
Hi.

00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:25.583
I'm Pong.

00:14:26.666 --> 00:14:27.500
I…

00:14:29.041 --> 00:14:30.291
I know your daughter.

00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:34.250
I thought I could help her escape.

00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:36.916
I'm so sorry I failed.

00:14:38.125 --> 00:14:39.875
The guilt has haunted me.

00:14:41.166 --> 00:14:45.375
If I'd put my foot down and told
your daughter to go that first night,

00:14:46.625 --> 00:14:48.916
maybe things would've been different.

00:14:57.791 --> 00:14:59.458
Your daughter was really brave.

00:15:01.708 --> 00:15:03.291
She was in so much danger…

00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:07.458
…but still put her friends first.

00:15:08.791 --> 00:15:09.833
I think…

00:15:12.208 --> 00:15:13.666
…she is a hero.

00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:21.250
I'm so sorry.

00:15:25.833 --> 00:15:27.083
Thank you for telling me.

00:15:32.583 --> 00:15:34.000
Wait.

00:15:38.458 --> 00:15:40.916
This… This is my contact.

00:15:45.125 --> 00:15:46.625
I want Chang Shih-kai dead.

00:15:55.583 --> 00:15:56.541
Let me help.

00:15:57.291 --> 00:15:58.208
Let me help.

00:16:05.208 --> 00:16:07.458
Yes, please check this number for me.

00:16:08.125 --> 00:16:08.958
Okay.

00:16:11.458 --> 00:16:14.000
Contact me if you find anything.

00:16:14.125 --> 00:16:14.958
Yes.

00:16:16.125 --> 00:16:16.958
Okay.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:03.833
Chao Ching.

00:17:17.166 --> 00:17:18.916
She could've escaped.

00:17:30.541 --> 00:17:32.208
It's all my fault.

00:17:32.291 --> 00:17:34.375
I was too full of myself.

00:17:36.916 --> 00:17:39.250
If I'd taught her to be more selfish,

00:17:40.541 --> 00:17:42.250
she wouldn't have died.

00:17:45.375 --> 00:17:47.125
If even you're giving up,

00:17:47.916 --> 00:17:49.000
what will I do?

00:17:51.541 --> 00:17:55.333
Do you know why
I've always had your back?

00:17:56.583 --> 00:17:58.583
Because you're never selfish.

00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:02.041
To you, right is right,
and wrong is wrong.

00:18:02.125 --> 00:18:03.750
So I know you'd never hurt me.

00:18:05.666 --> 00:18:07.791
I trust no one in this world

00:18:08.708 --> 00:18:10.208
except you.

00:18:57.916 --> 00:18:58.875
I'm Eason.

00:19:00.375 --> 00:19:02.291
English or Chinese?

00:19:09.458 --> 00:19:11.083
How did you contact my agent?

00:19:19.583 --> 00:19:21.333
Sorry, I don't want to work today.

00:19:21.416 --> 00:19:22.833
Hey. I've already paid.

00:19:33.916 --> 00:19:34.750
Okay.

00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:42.041
Want to join me?

00:19:42.125 --> 00:19:42.958
No.

00:20:41.625 --> 00:20:43.333
What would you like to do?

00:20:44.458 --> 00:20:45.291
I…

00:20:45.875 --> 00:20:47.416
I just want to chat.

00:21:03.125 --> 00:21:04.500
Are you making fun of me?

00:21:04.583 --> 00:21:05.416
No.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.541
I genuinely came to talk to you.

00:21:22.291 --> 00:21:23.791
What exactly do you want?

00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:48.916
This is my daughter.

00:21:50.916 --> 00:21:52.041
The doctor said

00:21:53.666 --> 00:21:55.416
she might never wake up.

00:21:58.166 --> 00:22:00.750
Did that guy do this to her?

00:22:00.833 --> 00:22:01.666
Yes.

00:22:02.958 --> 00:22:04.125
So you understand?

00:22:05.208 --> 00:22:07.833
We can't let Chang Shih-kai
get away again.

00:22:08.583 --> 00:22:11.000
We have to get him
and make sure he's tried.

00:22:12.833 --> 00:22:14.125
Please help us.

00:22:19.666 --> 00:22:20.958
It's not my problem.

00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:24.791
Can I go now?

00:22:42.375 --> 00:22:45.625
Can the witness tell us about
your relationship with the victim?

00:22:45.708 --> 00:22:46.875
She's my grandma.

00:22:47.416 --> 00:22:50.333
According to the statement
the police have provided us,

00:22:50.416 --> 00:22:53.750
you were the first to arrive on the scene
when this happened.

00:22:54.416 --> 00:22:55.333
Yes, ma'am.

00:22:55.958 --> 00:22:57.541
Can you tell us what you saw?

00:23:00.541 --> 00:23:01.958
When I arrived,

00:23:02.041 --> 00:23:04.375
I saw that she was fighting with someone.

00:23:04.458 --> 00:23:06.166
So I ran up to her.

00:23:07.291 --> 00:23:10.666
And then I saw this…
this guy with this huge brick.

00:23:12.375 --> 00:23:14.750
He just smashed it into my grandma's head.

00:23:17.291 --> 00:23:21.041
And the next thing I know,
she just collapsed to the floor.

00:23:21.666 --> 00:23:24.666
Did you see the perpetrator
who attacked your grandmother?

00:23:42.208 --> 00:23:43.208
Yes, I did.

00:23:44.083 --> 00:23:45.500
Is the person in court?

00:23:47.791 --> 00:23:49.291
It was him.

00:23:49.375 --> 00:23:50.916
He tried to kill my grandma.

00:23:52.333 --> 00:23:53.458
Objection.

00:23:54.833 --> 00:23:56.416
- Order.
- I've never seen you.

00:23:56.500 --> 00:23:57.333
Objection.

00:23:57.416 --> 00:23:58.875
What the hell?

00:23:58.958 --> 00:24:00.250
I don't know him.

00:24:00.333 --> 00:24:02.416
How could I kill a woman
I've never met?

00:24:03.208 --> 00:24:05.166
- Objection!
- He's a direct witness now.

00:24:05.250 --> 00:24:07.333
Which means
Chang Shih-kai can be charged.

00:24:07.416 --> 00:24:08.458
Because I was afraid.

00:24:08.541 --> 00:24:10.625
He killed so many people
and he's a fugitive.

00:24:10.708 --> 00:24:14.166
I was afraid he was going to avenge me.
I decided to trust the law.

00:24:14.250 --> 00:24:17.708
The justice system will give
this monster the punishment he deserves.

00:24:17.791 --> 00:24:20.541
- I'll kill you, motherfucker.
- May I plead the court, your honor.

00:24:20.625 --> 00:24:23.416
It is obvious the defendant's attorney
is trying to delay the case here.

00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:25.833
The main suspect,
Chang Shih-kai, was extradited

00:24:25.916 --> 00:24:28.458
{\an8}but jumped bail,
fleeing to Southeast Asia.

00:24:28.541 --> 00:24:29.833
{\an8}While in hiding,

00:24:29.916 --> 00:24:32.750
{\an8}due to an assault charge,
he was arrested again.

00:24:32.833 --> 00:24:34.291
The victims' families

00:24:34.375 --> 00:24:36.750
initiated criminal and civil lawsuits

00:24:36.833 --> 00:24:38.875
against Chang Shih-kai in Southeast Asia.

00:24:41.625 --> 00:24:43.291
The second floor here is vacant.

00:24:43.375 --> 00:24:44.500
You can stay there.

00:24:44.583 --> 00:24:48.125
You can save on rent
and focus on taking care of your daughter.

00:24:48.208 --> 00:24:50.041
I have over ten stores here.

00:24:50.125 --> 00:24:53.583
Someone already takes care of purchases,
restocking, and logistics.

00:24:53.666 --> 00:24:55.291
So don't worry about any of that.

00:24:55.375 --> 00:24:56.833
Just watch the store.

00:24:56.916 --> 00:24:57.833
Thank you.

00:24:59.625 --> 00:25:00.458
Thank you.

00:25:01.125 --> 00:25:02.583
Please take care of Hui-chun.

00:25:03.458 --> 00:25:05.458
Don't worry. I will help her.

00:25:05.958 --> 00:25:07.708
After an overruled first trial

00:25:07.791 --> 00:25:10.000
and a 20-year sentence in the second,

00:25:10.083 --> 00:25:13.291
the long awaited verdict
has finally been reached.

00:25:13.375 --> 00:25:14.250
The death penalty.

00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:18.000
Why does it feel like

00:25:18.416 --> 00:25:20.250
the death penalty wasn't a punishment

00:25:20.333 --> 00:25:21.500
for Chang Shih-kai,

00:25:21.583 --> 00:25:23.333
but a reward?

00:25:33.583 --> 00:25:35.375
My friend at the police station

00:25:35.458 --> 00:25:38.000
told me they caught
one of Chang Shih-kai's men.

00:25:38.083 --> 00:25:40.541
He's probably the one
who assaulted your grandma.

00:25:41.291 --> 00:25:42.875
But I get the feeling

00:25:42.958 --> 00:25:45.250
someone else is behind all this.

00:25:51.666 --> 00:25:53.541
Chao Ching and I have a plan.

00:25:55.458 --> 00:25:56.916
Are you willing to join us?

00:26:18.541 --> 00:26:19.625
Are you okay?

00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:22.833
Let me help you.

00:26:27.708 --> 00:26:30.166
Mr. Li said Chung
was caught for drug dealing.

00:26:30.708 --> 00:26:33.791
All the drug dealers in Benkha
get held in the same prison.

00:26:33.875 --> 00:26:35.458
Are you sure about this?

00:26:35.958 --> 00:26:37.375
Don't worry. I have checked.

00:26:37.458 --> 00:26:38.875
Just a few days in jail.

00:26:39.666 --> 00:26:41.083
I want to make a report.

00:26:41.666 --> 00:26:43.625
There's someone selling drugs.

00:26:45.208 --> 00:26:46.416
Shit.

00:26:52.458 --> 00:26:54.625
When Pong finds Chung,

00:26:54.708 --> 00:26:58.000
he can find out what's going on
between Chang Shih-kai and his mom.

00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:02.708
Jin Jin had been to Benkha before.

00:27:02.791 --> 00:27:06.083
She met Chang Shih-kai before I did.
And she started all this.

00:27:06.166 --> 00:27:07.791
There's something you need to know.

00:27:08.416 --> 00:27:11.041
How'd he know
I was helping those girls escape?

00:27:11.125 --> 00:27:13.083
Because someone snitched.

00:27:13.166 --> 00:27:14.000
Who?

00:27:15.833 --> 00:27:16.666
Jin Jin.

00:27:18.708 --> 00:27:20.000
If Jin Jin does die,

00:27:20.083 --> 00:27:22.833
we can resurrect her
like we did Chang Shih-kai.

00:27:22.916 --> 00:27:24.666
Then we'll find out the truth.

00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:26.416
So we kill my daughter?

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.291
At least you'll have seven days
to say goodbye to her properly.

00:27:32.041 --> 00:27:33.916
Hsin-yi never got that chance.

00:27:59.458 --> 00:28:00.666
After all that, it seems

00:28:00.750 --> 00:28:03.458
Hui-chun and I
are the only ones who want you alive.

00:28:03.541 --> 00:28:05.000
Everyone else wants you dead.

00:28:07.708 --> 00:28:09.708
How's it feel
being betrayed by your mom?

00:28:17.958 --> 00:28:19.083
Nothing special.

00:28:20.833 --> 00:28:23.250
No one trusts anyone anyway.

00:28:24.166 --> 00:28:26.416
It's all about shared interests.

00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:28.375
I'm not at all surprised to hear that

00:28:29.125 --> 00:28:30.208
coming from you.

00:28:32.125 --> 00:28:33.541
Think you can trust Hui-chun?

00:28:33.625 --> 00:28:34.833
Shut it.

00:28:34.916 --> 00:28:36.666
She's not who you think she is.

00:28:37.291 --> 00:28:39.333
You probably think I don't know her,

00:28:40.166 --> 00:28:42.250
but I know her daughter very well.

00:28:46.041 --> 00:28:47.208
How did you meet?

00:28:49.958 --> 00:28:51.500
We met online.

00:28:52.625 --> 00:28:54.000
Wasn't she a YouTuber?

00:28:54.625 --> 00:28:56.458
She wanted to make videos here,

00:28:56.541 --> 00:28:58.125
but then she fell for me.

00:28:58.208 --> 00:28:59.958
She wanted to stay and make money.

00:29:02.083 --> 00:29:04.625
She started making videos
to help me recruit.

00:29:04.708 --> 00:29:07.375
I paid her for every person she recruited.

00:29:08.333 --> 00:29:09.583
I'll tell you a secret.

00:29:10.666 --> 00:29:13.583
She has a personal account in Taiwan.

00:29:13.666 --> 00:29:15.375
I wired the money to her there.

00:29:15.458 --> 00:29:17.000
We earned that money together.

00:29:17.625 --> 00:29:19.375
When Hsin-yi wanted to escape,

00:29:19.875 --> 00:29:23.458
Jin Jin told me about it
so she could stay and make more money.

00:29:25.041 --> 00:29:27.625
Hsin-yi trusted Jin Jin way too much.

00:29:30.041 --> 00:29:31.250
I'm telling the truth.

00:30:07.666 --> 00:30:11.041
Hui-chun, somethings happened.
Come to my hotel.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.083
Ouch.

00:30:45.166 --> 00:30:46.000
It's you.

00:30:46.583 --> 00:30:47.958
Sorry I woke you.

00:30:53.916 --> 00:30:54.750
It's fine.

00:30:56.083 --> 00:30:56.916
Ouch.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:30:59.833
Go home.

00:31:01.916 --> 00:31:03.291
I'll take care of Jin Jin.

00:31:04.041 --> 00:31:04.875
Okay.

00:31:09.708 --> 00:31:10.958
The bill's on the table.

00:31:11.833 --> 00:31:13.250
Tell Hui-chun to pay for it.

00:31:41.958 --> 00:31:43.083
Hello, Christina?

00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:46.666
You haven't replied. I'm a bit worried.

00:31:46.750 --> 00:31:48.708
You're not in danger, are you?

00:31:50.208 --> 00:31:52.041
Call me when you get this.

00:31:53.958 --> 00:31:54.791
Bye-bye.

00:31:57.583 --> 00:31:58.791
Still haven't found her?

00:31:58.875 --> 00:31:59.916
No.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.833
She's not returning my calls
or my messages.

00:32:03.958 --> 00:32:05.708
Could her mom have caught her?

00:32:05.791 --> 00:32:07.166
I don't think so.

00:32:07.250 --> 00:32:08.833
She called me an hour ago,

00:32:08.916 --> 00:32:10.041
saying she was coming.

00:32:11.916 --> 00:32:12.750
Hello?

00:32:19.208 --> 00:32:20.208
Where're you going?

00:32:20.291 --> 00:32:21.500
The hospital.

00:32:21.583 --> 00:32:22.541
I'll go with you.

00:32:22.625 --> 00:32:24.375
No need. Wait for Chang I-ting.

00:33:04.166 --> 00:33:05.000
Hello?

00:33:08.458 --> 00:33:09.375
Where's Jin Jin?

00:33:39.708 --> 00:33:40.541
Chao Ching!

00:33:43.333 --> 00:33:44.416
Where's my daughter?

00:33:54.958 --> 00:33:56.625
She's in another hospital.

00:33:56.708 --> 00:33:57.750
Which hospital?

00:33:59.458 --> 00:34:00.750
I can't tell you now.

00:34:01.541 --> 00:34:02.458
Why not?

00:34:08.041 --> 00:34:10.833
I know you won't hurt her, right?

00:34:12.041 --> 00:34:13.666
Why would I hurt her?

00:34:14.625 --> 00:34:15.666
What did she do?

00:34:17.125 --> 00:34:18.875
Are you hiding something from me?

00:34:18.958 --> 00:34:21.291
What would I hide from you?

00:34:21.875 --> 00:34:24.666
Did you know she was
Chang Shih-kai's girlfriend?

00:34:24.750 --> 00:34:27.208
She tricked Hsin-yi
and An Chi into coming here.

00:34:28.875 --> 00:34:30.583
Did An Chi tell you this?

00:34:31.125 --> 00:34:33.500
- An Chi is lying!
- Chang Shih-kai told me!

00:34:34.583 --> 00:34:38.041
And he said
Jin Jin has an account in Taiwan.

00:34:38.125 --> 00:34:40.666
She got paid
for every person she helped recruit!

00:34:40.750 --> 00:34:42.208
That's not true!

00:34:42.291 --> 00:34:43.833
I checked every deposit

00:34:43.916 --> 00:34:46.208
in Jin Jin's accounts.

00:34:46.291 --> 00:34:49.416
They were all small deposits
she got for her sponsored content.

00:34:49.916 --> 00:34:51.916
Chang Shih-kai's a con artist!

00:34:52.708 --> 00:34:54.458
You trust him over me?

00:34:57.541 --> 00:34:58.583
I trust you…

00:35:00.666 --> 00:35:01.916
…but not Jin Jin.

00:35:07.166 --> 00:35:08.041
I told you.

00:35:09.250 --> 00:35:10.833
I won't let anyone get away

00:35:11.458 --> 00:35:12.708
with hurting Hsin-yi!

00:35:23.875 --> 00:35:25.625
And I won't let anyone get away

00:35:26.958 --> 00:35:28.250
with hurting Jin Jin.

00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:12.833
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

00:36:12.916 --> 00:36:13.875
Key?

00:36:16.166 --> 00:36:17.166
Keep this secret.

00:36:19.041 --> 00:36:20.666
Pay the rent soon.

00:37:11.291 --> 00:37:12.416
What? What?

00:37:20.625 --> 00:37:21.958
Who were they, Pong?

00:37:23.125 --> 00:37:24.125
It's okay.

00:37:25.041 --> 00:37:27.125
I owed them some money.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:29.291
They came to collect.

00:37:36.666 --> 00:37:38.125
Where're you going?

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:40.083
To find Hui-chun.

00:37:40.708 --> 00:37:41.583
Wait, Eason.

00:38:02.750 --> 00:38:03.583
Fuck.

00:38:54.166 --> 00:38:55.708
I just told Chao Ching

00:38:57.250 --> 00:38:58.875
that no one trusts anyone.

00:38:59.916 --> 00:39:01.541
And you'd betray her eventually.

00:39:03.250 --> 00:39:04.875
Aren't I good at reading people?

00:39:13.541 --> 00:39:15.416
Why are you setting Jin Jin up?

00:39:19.791 --> 00:39:21.708
I'd never set her up.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:25.333
I love her.

00:39:25.958 --> 00:39:27.708
Why would I set her up?
