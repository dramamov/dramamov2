WEBVTT

00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:02.585
Look, Matmat's smiling now.

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:04.754
He even chatted with Nurse Eden.

00:00:04.838 --> 00:00:05.839
Seems like he's okay.

00:00:05.922 --> 00:00:08.717
Patrick, think about
your own happiness too.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.343
So you can share it with Matmat.

00:00:10.427 --> 00:00:12.804
It's okay to put
yourself first some times.

00:00:12.887 --> 00:00:15.015
We have to end up together.

00:00:15.098 --> 00:00:16.349
I have Matmat's favorite.

00:00:16.433 --> 00:00:17.600
Come back here

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:19.936
if you don't want me to break this.

00:00:21.146 --> 00:00:23.690
I knew it. You can't resist me.

00:00:23.773 --> 00:00:25.316
What's for dinner--

00:00:26.151 --> 00:00:27.527
Aah!

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.487
I'm sorry, ma'am.
Someone's looking for you.

00:00:29.571 --> 00:00:32.449
Patrick asked me to get their things.

00:01:32.133 --> 00:01:38.431
{\an8}

00:01:52.237 --> 00:01:53.446
{\an8}

00:01:54.364 --> 00:01:55.698
{\an8}Matmat?

00:01:55.782 --> 00:02:00.662
{\an8}

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:04.624
{\an8}Matmat, I'm home.

00:02:05.708 --> 00:02:07.252
{\an8}I'm coming in, alright?

00:02:09.546 --> 00:02:15.718
{\an8}

00:02:25.728 --> 00:02:27.313
{\an8}

00:02:30.024 --> 00:02:32.026
{\an8}

00:02:33.778 --> 00:02:36.990
{\an8}

00:02:56.634 --> 00:02:57.886
{\an8}Matmat?

00:03:04.893 --> 00:03:06.060
{\an8}Matmat.

00:03:06.144 --> 00:03:08.146
{\an8}Please stop avoiding me.

00:03:20.033 --> 00:03:21.451
{\an8}Matmat…

00:03:24.954 --> 00:03:26.372
I'm sorry.

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.711
I'm sorry for what I did.

00:03:38.843 --> 00:03:40.845
Please forgive me, Matmat.

00:03:45.225 --> 00:03:48.603
W-Why are you saying sorry?

00:03:53.524 --> 00:03:55.610
Sorry if you thought…

00:03:58.321 --> 00:04:00.907
I wouldn't come back for you at the river.

00:04:05.787 --> 00:04:07.705
Sorry if I thought…

00:04:11.584 --> 00:04:13.378
it'd be better if you just died.

00:04:22.971 --> 00:04:24.889
Sorry also, if I wished…

00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:31.396
to have a normal sibling instead.

00:04:33.398 --> 00:04:35.191
Just like other kids.

00:04:40.113 --> 00:04:41.322
Sorry.

00:04:47.412 --> 00:04:49.497
Sorry if I lied to you.

00:05:06.723 --> 00:05:08.016
I'm sorry, Matmat.

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:14.564
Sorry.

00:05:37.545 --> 00:05:39.839
Your older brother is here.

00:05:42.633 --> 00:05:45.136
Matmat is here.

00:05:46.596 --> 00:05:47.597
I'm sorry.

00:05:48.806 --> 00:05:49.807
Sorry.

00:06:21.923 --> 00:06:23.049
Mia?

00:06:26.761 --> 00:06:27.762
Mia!

00:06:33.726 --> 00:06:34.727
Mia!

00:06:39.107 --> 00:06:41.442
Mia, I'll just come
back for the rest of their stuff.

00:06:41.526 --> 00:06:43.528
I only took the important things for now.

00:06:48.366 --> 00:06:49.367
Mia?

00:06:54.539 --> 00:06:56.624
That woman is really something else.

00:06:57.458 --> 00:07:00.044
Not only did she not help me,
but she also disappeared on me.

00:07:00.962 --> 00:07:03.923
She's got some nerve after inviting
Patrick and Matmat to stay here.

00:07:13.057 --> 00:07:14.684
Mia, I'm going now!

00:07:18.938 --> 00:07:20.857
I'll just leave your doors open, okay?

00:07:22.817 --> 00:07:24.318
Don't you know how to lock doors?

00:07:25.945 --> 00:07:27.363
What are you doing in there?

00:07:27.738 --> 00:07:28.990
I'm hungry.

00:07:29.407 --> 00:07:30.408
And so?

00:07:30.491 --> 00:07:32.493
Then make your own
food or have it delivered.

00:07:32.577 --> 00:07:33.411
I don't want to.

00:07:33.828 --> 00:07:35.163
Let's eat.

00:07:35.246 --> 00:07:36.706
What food do you have at home?

00:07:39.208 --> 00:07:41.794
Our food isn't good.
Besides, it's all gone now.

00:07:43.004 --> 00:07:44.589
I don't believe you.

00:07:45.131 --> 00:07:48.634
Your mom, who's
always willing to feed the hungry,

00:07:48.718 --> 00:07:50.636
suddenly ran out of food?

00:07:53.055 --> 00:07:54.182
Get out.

00:07:55.975 --> 00:07:56.976
I don't want to.

00:07:58.394 --> 00:08:00.771
- Get out now.
- I said I don't want to.

00:08:02.273 --> 00:08:04.609
I won't get out of
here unless it's for dinner.

00:08:11.657 --> 00:08:12.658
Fine.

00:08:12.742 --> 00:08:14.285
But I'll drive.

00:08:14.368 --> 00:08:15.328
Get out.

00:09:17.056 --> 00:09:18.266
Mama!

00:09:18.349 --> 00:09:19.350
- Hmm?
- Ma!

00:09:19.433 --> 00:09:21.435
Uh, I already cooked rice.

00:09:21.852 --> 00:09:22.853
Very good.

00:09:23.437 --> 00:09:25.439
What about your assignment?

00:09:26.315 --> 00:09:27.984
- Is it finished?
- Here.

00:09:41.289 --> 00:09:42.290
How is it, Ma?

00:09:47.378 --> 00:09:51.465
I didn't send you to that
writing fellowship just to write garbage.

00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:00.182
- Ma, give it back--
- You call this writing?

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:02.059
This is your best?

00:10:02.602 --> 00:10:03.603
Of course.

00:10:04.103 --> 00:10:05.438
I gave it my best.

00:10:05.521 --> 00:10:07.815
Your best is garbage!

00:10:07.898 --> 00:10:10.985
People will laugh at you for this--

00:10:11.068 --> 00:10:12.612
Then let them laugh!

00:10:12.695 --> 00:10:14.196
What matters is that I wrote this myself.

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:15.823
Do you hear yourself?

00:10:15.906 --> 00:10:17.867
And you're even proud of it?

00:10:18.451 --> 00:10:20.995
- Because if it were me--
- That's the point, Ma!

00:10:21.704 --> 00:10:23.414
This is mine, not yours!

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:27.960
Mama, I'm not a child anymore!

00:10:28.711 --> 00:10:31.797
You can't keep writing for me forever!

00:10:32.298 --> 00:10:33.591
This is my fellowship.

00:10:33.674 --> 00:10:36.510
- Therefore, this is my story!
- You don't talk to me like that!

00:10:37.428 --> 00:10:41.265
- Ma, leave me to my own writing style!
- You can only talk to me that way

00:10:41.349 --> 00:10:43.351
once you've proven yourself!

00:10:51.233 --> 00:10:53.819
[rustling

00:11:08.626 --> 00:11:09.752
Patpat?

00:11:11.921 --> 00:11:13.255
What is it, Matmat?

00:11:20.638 --> 00:11:22.848
We don't have

00:11:23.933 --> 00:11:25.351
a mom anymore.

00:11:26.852 --> 00:11:29.021
We don't have a dad either.

00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:33.484
It's just the two of us.

00:11:39.073 --> 00:11:40.324
Yes, Matmat.

00:11:43.285 --> 00:11:45.121
Just Matmat and Patpat, right?

00:11:47.832 --> 00:11:49.750
Patpat is only mine?

00:11:53.587 --> 00:11:55.464
No one will take me away from Matmat.

00:12:03.514 --> 00:12:06.642
Good night, Patpat.

00:12:07.977 --> 00:12:09.228
Good night, Matmat.

00:12:31.625 --> 00:12:35.671
I shouldn't have listened
to you when you said you'd drive.

00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:38.299
I should have gotten out of the car.

00:12:39.884 --> 00:12:41.093
You're hungry.

00:12:41.802 --> 00:12:42.928
Here's food.

00:12:43.804 --> 00:12:44.805
Eat.

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:52.646
You're drinking alone?

00:12:54.064 --> 00:12:55.608
You're not going to offer me some?

00:13:05.618 --> 00:13:06.619
Cheers.

00:13:09.246 --> 00:13:10.998
Fine, whatever.

00:13:21.967 --> 00:13:23.552
Wow, Gemma.

00:13:23.969 --> 00:13:25.221
Thirsty much?

00:13:27.473 --> 00:13:30.100
Someone's getting on my nerves.

00:13:31.018 --> 00:13:32.311
Just cooling off.

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:38.484
Gemma, Gemma, Gemma.

00:13:38.567 --> 00:13:41.487
You're showing your true colors now.

00:13:46.033 --> 00:13:48.202
Aren't you afraid of me anymore?

00:13:50.371 --> 00:13:51.956
I'm not scared of you.

00:13:55.459 --> 00:13:57.044
I'm pissed at you.

00:14:00.005 --> 00:14:01.298
I don't like you.

00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:08.472
I envy you.

00:14:12.476 --> 00:14:13.644
You envy me?

00:14:15.896 --> 00:14:17.189
I'm jealous.

00:14:29.201 --> 00:14:30.369
It doesn't even taste good.

00:14:32.121 --> 00:14:33.455
But you finished it.

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:37.251
For someone who eats for free,
you complain too much.

00:14:38.335 --> 00:14:39.420
Excuse me.

00:14:42.172 --> 00:14:43.340
Hmm?

00:14:43.424 --> 00:14:46.760
Madeth, have you done
what I asked you to do for Mia?

00:14:46.844 --> 00:14:49.179
Yes, Boss V. It's ready. All done.

00:14:49.263 --> 00:14:52.474
Okay, so everything is set.
All we have to do is wait for tomorrow.

00:14:54.351 --> 00:14:55.686
Yeah, wait.

00:14:56.186 --> 00:14:57.688
Wait again!

00:14:57.771 --> 00:14:59.189
We're always waiting.

00:14:59.273 --> 00:15:00.941
Waiting for Miss Mia.

00:15:01.025 --> 00:15:04.111
Waiting for her to show up,
waiting for her to be okay,

00:15:04.194 --> 00:15:06.280
waiting for her mood swings to pass.

00:15:06.363 --> 00:15:07.656
Always just waiting.

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:08.824
Hey, Madeth.

00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:10.534
What, Boss V.?

00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:12.703
I'm just saying the truth.

00:15:13.454 --> 00:15:17.166
Are we really just waiting
for Miss Mia to write again?

00:15:17.249 --> 00:15:20.002
Waiting for her to create another story.

00:15:22.546 --> 00:15:26.425
Madeth, Mia is rare. She's one of a kind.

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:29.094
So, we need to wait for her.

00:15:29.178 --> 00:15:31.472
Wait on her own time.

00:15:32.431 --> 00:15:35.392
Boss V, it's not
that I'm complaining, but…

00:15:37.436 --> 00:15:39.229
…is that really it?

00:15:39.313 --> 00:15:44.276
We'll just wait for her?
We can't even tell her to hurry a little?

00:15:47.154 --> 00:15:51.408
Hmm. Right? Because Boss V,
how long will you keep--

00:15:51.492 --> 00:15:52.534
Just leave it there.

00:15:52.618 --> 00:15:55.955
How long will
you keep waiting for something

00:15:56.038 --> 00:15:59.333
or for someone when there's no certainty

00:15:59.416 --> 00:16:02.503
if they'll ever be ready for you?

00:16:05.297 --> 00:16:07.883
Patience is not about waiting, Madeth.

00:16:08.968 --> 00:16:10.803
It's about how you're waiting,

00:16:11.679 --> 00:16:13.222
and who you waiting for.

00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:18.018
Because, you'll feel it.

00:16:18.894 --> 00:16:22.856
You'll feel if
someone is worth waiting for.

00:16:24.024 --> 00:16:25.234
Right?

00:16:26.902 --> 00:16:28.612
So meaningful.

00:16:28.696 --> 00:16:30.531
That's so profound, Boss V.

00:16:30.614 --> 00:16:32.866
So deep of you, Boss V.

00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:34.618
I thought it was only one year.

00:16:35.703 --> 00:16:36.745
One year?

00:16:36.829 --> 00:16:39.331
That's all you can wait? Just one year?

00:16:41.125 --> 00:16:42.251
Why?

00:16:42.334 --> 00:16:45.629
Wasn't Miss Mia given one
year to finish her latest book?

00:16:46.338 --> 00:16:48.007
That's what we're talking about.

00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:49.508
Or did you change the topic?

00:16:49.591 --> 00:16:52.428
Oh! Yes, yes, yes.

00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:54.388
That one.

00:16:54.471 --> 00:16:59.018
I thought we were
talking about our love lives.

00:16:59.810 --> 00:17:00.811
Oh.

00:17:03.022 --> 00:17:07.860
Well, if it's about love life,
I've already given up.

00:17:07.943 --> 00:17:10.529
I'm done with my waiting era.

00:17:10.612 --> 00:17:13.615
If I want something,
I go for it right away!

00:17:13.699 --> 00:17:17.411
If it's not available, I won't wait.

00:17:19.204 --> 00:17:20.664
How come?

00:17:20.748 --> 00:17:24.668
Well, Boss V, it's a sign.

00:17:24.752 --> 00:17:27.046
Sign that it's not meant to be.

00:17:28.422 --> 00:17:29.965
Remember that famous book quote?

00:17:30.049 --> 00:17:34.595
"If you want something, the universe
conspires to help you get it."

00:17:34.678 --> 00:17:36.055
See?

00:17:36.764 --> 00:17:40.601
If you've already done everything you can,
and you still have to wait,

00:17:40.684 --> 00:17:43.437
then it means it's
really not meant for you.

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:44.688
Simple.

00:17:56.241 --> 00:17:57.409
Mia!

00:17:58.327 --> 00:17:59.620
Just let me do it once.

00:18:01.246 --> 00:18:02.664
Do what?

00:18:04.708 --> 00:18:06.752
Slap you.

00:18:08.545 --> 00:18:13.717
I should slap you twice
so it'll have more impact.

00:18:13.801 --> 00:18:15.469
So we can get even.

00:18:18.222 --> 00:18:22.976
So we're entering
Gemma's violent era now, huh?

00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:24.978
Hey.

00:18:25.062 --> 00:18:27.564
You deserve that slap.

00:18:28.273 --> 00:18:32.152
Because you're
the biggest thorn in my side.

00:18:32.694 --> 00:18:33.904
Do you know that?

00:18:33.987 --> 00:18:35.239
You!

00:18:37.616 --> 00:18:39.409
You bullied me when we were kids.

00:18:39.493 --> 00:18:40.536
No, I didn't.

00:18:40.619 --> 00:18:43.455
Yes, you did.

00:18:43.539 --> 00:18:44.790
Yes, Mia.

00:18:45.916 --> 00:18:47.793
You locked me in the restroom.

00:18:48.418 --> 00:18:50.796
I only did that
because you're so-called friends

00:18:50.879 --> 00:18:53.173
were apparently
going to pull a prank on you.

00:18:55.968 --> 00:18:57.219
That's not true.

00:18:57.302 --> 00:18:58.345
Fine.

00:18:59.763 --> 00:19:01.765
Don't believe me.

00:19:02.558 --> 00:19:07.604
You were the reason
my friends avoided me.

00:19:08.814 --> 00:19:11.984
They were scared
that you'd bully them too.

00:19:14.403 --> 00:19:16.613
You're also the reason

00:19:16.697 --> 00:19:22.494
that the boy I like
didn't end up with me.

00:19:24.746 --> 00:19:32.421
You're the worst and
most evil of all villains.

00:19:32.504 --> 00:19:34.131
It's you, Mia!

00:19:37.843 --> 00:19:39.553
So, come on, Mia.

00:19:41.305 --> 00:19:43.432
Just let me slap you once.

00:19:43.515 --> 00:19:45.893
Mia…

00:19:45.976 --> 00:19:47.019
Just once.

00:19:47.936 --> 00:19:49.229
Ah!

00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:51.398
You witch.

00:19:57.779 --> 00:19:58.864
You know what?

00:20:00.532 --> 00:20:01.575
You're cute.

00:20:02.242 --> 00:20:03.702
You're cute when you're angry.

00:20:04.995 --> 00:20:06.163
I'm cute?

00:20:07.664 --> 00:20:09.458
I know I'm cute.

00:20:11.543 --> 00:20:13.295
Unfortunately,

00:20:13.378 --> 00:20:16.131
the boy I like doesn't like cute girls.

00:20:19.593 --> 00:20:23.013
Why does Patrick even like you?

00:20:25.807 --> 00:20:27.309
You're cute.

00:20:27.392 --> 00:20:28.685
I'm beautiful.

00:20:33.065 --> 00:20:35.234
- I'm cute.
- Mm-hmm.

00:20:35.317 --> 00:20:36.860
And you're beautiful.

00:20:36.944 --> 00:20:39.112
Mm-hmm.

00:20:44.409 --> 00:20:45.911
How dare you!

00:20:47.704 --> 00:20:48.747
Gemma?

00:20:49.665 --> 00:20:50.707
Gemma?

00:20:50.791 --> 00:20:52.042
Gemma?

00:20:54.461 --> 00:20:55.504
Gemma!

00:20:56.922 --> 00:20:58.882
I haven't gotten back at you yet.

00:21:01.551 --> 00:21:02.844
I hope it hurt.

00:21:23.532 --> 00:21:26.159
Thank you for that gift you gave Matmat.

00:21:26.243 --> 00:21:27.703
He's acting weird.

00:21:27.786 --> 00:21:29.871
Could you observe him too?

00:21:31.623 --> 00:21:33.000
Feelings are like colors.

00:21:33.083 --> 00:21:35.419
They have different shapes,
but they have the same color.

00:21:37.379 --> 00:21:39.256
Just Matmat and Patpat together.

00:21:40.465 --> 00:21:42.175
You're all alone here now.

00:21:42.259 --> 00:21:44.094
I'm fine. But I get cold at night.

00:21:44.177 --> 00:21:46.888
You miss them. You miss Patrick.

00:21:46.972 --> 00:21:48.140
He's right.
