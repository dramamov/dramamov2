WEBVTT

00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:02.460
I'll drive this car off the cliff.

00:00:02.544 --> 00:00:04.504
- What?
- We're going to die together.

00:00:04.587 --> 00:00:05.714
Mia, stop the car.

00:00:05.797 --> 00:00:07.549
Mia!

00:00:07.632 --> 00:00:09.050
You're not making any sense.

00:00:09.134 --> 00:00:11.720
You asked me to run away,
but you can't even stay long?

00:00:11.803 --> 00:00:13.638
You deserved that.

00:00:13.722 --> 00:00:15.265
How about a trip to Montanesa?

00:00:15.348 --> 00:00:16.808
Just a day trip, you and me.

00:00:16.891 --> 00:00:20.103
You never told me
you were a pressure cooker.

00:00:20.186 --> 00:00:21.354
You know how to soften me up.

00:00:21.438 --> 00:00:22.522
I could say the same.

00:00:22.605 --> 00:00:23.815
You're changing me for the better.

00:00:23.898 --> 00:00:28.111
Why I couldn't control my
anger when I saw you were hurt.

00:00:28.194 --> 00:00:30.238
- Is that a bad thing?
- Isn't it?

00:00:30.321 --> 00:00:32.407
For me, you were amazing.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.243
He's letting down his guard.

00:00:35.326 --> 00:00:37.037
I'll go to bed now. See you tomorrow.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.329
- Good night.
- Good night.

00:00:38.413 --> 00:00:39.414
You stupid goat!

00:00:39.497 --> 00:00:41.166
You're ruining my life!

00:01:38.598 --> 00:01:40.809
Matmat, join me for some snacks?

00:01:43.228 --> 00:01:44.646
What are those?

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.773
{\an8}I bought some rice cakes.

00:01:46.856 --> 00:01:48.858
{\an8}I got bored, so I went for a walk.

00:01:48.942 --> 00:01:51.402
{\an8}Matmat wants those rice cakes.

00:01:53.822 --> 00:01:56.491
{\an8}But where, where's Mia?

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:00.328
{\an8}She's probably in her room. What's up?

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:05.125
{\an8}Matmat wants to… to wait for Mia.

00:02:05.208 --> 00:02:08.503
{\an8}He wants them to eat together.

00:02:10.004 --> 00:02:11.798
{\an8}Why do you want to eat with her?

00:02:12.423 --> 00:02:13.633
{\an8}Because…

00:02:16.094 --> 00:02:17.762
{\an8}s-she's my bestie.

00:02:18.346 --> 00:02:22.851
{\an8}

00:02:22.934 --> 00:02:24.060
{\an8}Y-You don't know that?

00:02:24.144 --> 00:02:26.604
{\an8}You know, bestie?

00:02:28.314 --> 00:02:29.482
{\an8}"Bestie"?

00:02:30.817 --> 00:02:33.111
{\an8}It's the same as "best friend," right?

00:02:33.611 --> 00:02:34.779
{\an8}Right.

00:02:34.863 --> 00:02:37.031
{\an8}We're best friends.

00:02:37.115 --> 00:02:40.577
{\an8}

00:02:41.411 --> 00:02:42.495
Bestie.

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:47.125
That's good.

00:02:49.711 --> 00:02:53.089
Matmat, don't forget
your session with Dr. Anok tomorrow.

00:02:54.424 --> 00:02:56.009
O-Okay.

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.472
And when you're done,
is it okay if you stay with Jason?

00:03:02.098 --> 00:03:05.768
At his house or the restaurant?

00:03:07.604 --> 00:03:09.898
At his house. Stay the night with him.

00:03:14.444 --> 00:03:15.486
Why?

00:03:19.407 --> 00:03:21.200
Uh, well, you see…

00:03:22.201 --> 00:03:25.204
I've got something
to take care of in Montanesa.

00:03:26.706 --> 00:03:30.001
If Matmat stays
overnight at Jason's house,

00:03:30.084 --> 00:03:33.922
his bestie Mia's going
to be here all by herself.

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:37.842
She won't be around, Matmat.

00:03:37.926 --> 00:03:39.135
She's got stuff to do, too.

00:03:40.929 --> 00:03:45.099
Are you going to see
a patient in Montanesa?

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.103
Not exactly.

00:03:52.315 --> 00:03:53.942
But it's important.

00:03:57.111 --> 00:03:58.905
T-Take care, Patpat.

00:04:00.657 --> 00:04:04.994
Matmat's going to divide
this so he and his bestie Mia…

00:04:06.704 --> 00:04:08.414
can both have some.

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:11.167
This is for bestie.

00:04:11.251 --> 00:04:13.419
This is for Matmat.

00:04:14.295 --> 00:04:18.007
{\an8}

00:04:18.591 --> 00:04:20.510
{\an8}-
Delicious, right?

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:35.441
{\an8}

00:04:35.525 --> 00:04:37.610
{\an8}I have something for you.

00:04:42.907 --> 00:04:44.701
{\an8}This is your favorite, remember?

00:04:49.163 --> 00:04:54.711
{\an8}

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:59.007
{\an8}A little taste never hurt anybody.

00:05:19.944 --> 00:05:21.154
Did you miss it?

00:05:31.497 --> 00:05:34.125
You know how much I love you, right?

00:05:36.127 --> 00:05:38.504
I hope you never forget that.

00:05:47.805 --> 00:05:48.973
Nurse Olivia?

00:05:54.854 --> 00:05:56.564
I see you took Samuel outside.

00:05:57.398 --> 00:05:58.775
Did he feel like getting some fresh air?

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:00.818
Oh yes, doc.

00:06:00.902 --> 00:06:03.071
I decided to bring him out here myself,

00:06:03.154 --> 00:06:05.281
so he'd get used to me.

00:06:05.364 --> 00:06:06.365
Ah.

00:06:06.991 --> 00:06:08.993
May I speak with Samuel?

00:06:09.619 --> 00:06:10.703
Yes, doc.

00:06:27.887 --> 00:06:29.931
I was hoping to see
how you're doing, Samuel.

00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:33.684
You're not attending
your daughter's classes.

00:06:35.103 --> 00:06:38.022
Would you like to spend
some time alone with her?

00:06:38.815 --> 00:06:40.274
Don't you miss her?

00:06:41.484 --> 00:06:43.611
Why would I miss her?

00:06:44.737 --> 00:06:48.449
Just because.
I mean, she's your daughter.

00:06:51.786 --> 00:06:52.954
A woman.

00:06:54.205 --> 00:06:56.916
Which woman are you referring to?

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:00.670
She is evil.

00:07:04.799 --> 00:07:06.509
A spawn of the devil.

00:07:07.802 --> 00:07:08.761
Well…

00:07:08.845 --> 00:07:11.305
Who is this woman?

00:07:11.806 --> 00:07:13.224
Where is she?

00:07:13.599 --> 00:07:14.767
She is dead.

00:07:16.894 --> 00:07:18.104
I killed her.

00:07:20.606 --> 00:07:21.899
You killed her?

00:07:23.192 --> 00:07:24.318
Where is she?

00:07:27.321 --> 00:07:28.739
She has returned.

00:07:31.534 --> 00:07:32.952
She has come back,

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.204
to…

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:39.500
to kill me.

00:07:40.418 --> 00:07:42.253
She's back, and she's going to kill me!

00:07:42.336 --> 00:07:44.755
- Samuel. Samuel.
- She's going to kill me!

00:07:44.839 --> 00:07:46.799
- Samuel, calm down.
- She's going to kill me!

00:07:46.883 --> 00:07:48.968
- Nurse! Nurse, nurse!
- She's after my life!

00:07:49.051 --> 00:07:50.511
I need some help here!

00:07:50.595 --> 00:07:54.223
- Nurse, hurry!
- She's returned to kill me!

00:07:54.307 --> 00:07:56.642
She's back, and she's going to kill me!

00:07:56.726 --> 00:07:59.103
- Samuel…
- She's out to kill me!

00:07:59.187 --> 00:08:00.480
She wants me dead!

00:08:00.563 --> 00:08:02.064
She's going to murder me!

00:08:02.148 --> 00:08:04.984
She's going to kill me!

00:08:06.694 --> 00:08:08.404
Look after him for me, okay?

00:08:09.489 --> 00:08:11.699
Don't ask about it.
And it's only a one-time thing.

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:14.827
- Talk to you soon. I'm busy.
- Patrick!

00:08:18.289 --> 00:08:20.958
Patrick, let's go!

00:08:25.004 --> 00:08:26.589
You're going out like that?

00:08:26.672 --> 00:08:27.715
Yes.

00:08:28.341 --> 00:08:29.383
Gorgeous, right?

00:08:31.511 --> 00:08:32.887
Don't you think you're a little…

00:08:33.888 --> 00:08:35.223
overdressed?

00:08:35.932 --> 00:08:36.974
No.

00:08:37.058 --> 00:08:38.768
This is not too much.

00:08:39.393 --> 00:08:40.811
I think it's pretty.

00:08:40.895 --> 00:08:42.188
Now, let me ask you.

00:08:42.271 --> 00:08:43.773
Is that the look you're going with?

00:08:44.732 --> 00:08:46.067
Your final outfit?

00:08:46.692 --> 00:08:47.860
Let me check.

00:08:47.944 --> 00:08:49.403
- Mia!
- I want to see!

00:08:49.487 --> 00:08:51.030
- Please don't.
- Give it to me.

00:08:51.113 --> 00:08:52.907
- Mia, stop.
- I just want to check!

00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:53.866
Oh.

00:08:57.203 --> 00:08:58.704
What's this?

00:09:01.207 --> 00:09:02.291
A rag.

00:09:02.917 --> 00:09:05.294
It looks like it's
been through the worst.

00:09:06.212 --> 00:09:08.506
Hang on, why are you bringing a rag?

00:09:14.345 --> 00:09:15.471
Hello, doc?

00:09:18.391 --> 00:09:19.600
I can make it work.

00:09:20.393 --> 00:09:21.394
Alright.

00:09:22.603 --> 00:09:23.729
Okay, bye.

00:09:24.897 --> 00:09:27.567
Dr. Anok needs to talk to me.
I have to go meet him.

00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:29.068
You just talked to him.

00:09:29.151 --> 00:09:31.654
- Wait here. We'll go once I've returned.
- Patrick!

00:09:31.737 --> 00:09:32.989
Mia, I'll be quick.

00:09:50.881 --> 00:09:52.300
How are you, Patrick?

00:09:53.301 --> 00:09:55.094
Did I interrupt your plans?

00:09:56.012 --> 00:09:58.431
Actually, I'm headed somewhere today.

00:09:58.514 --> 00:09:59.557
Hmm.

00:10:00.224 --> 00:10:01.434
You're going on a date with Mia?

00:10:01.517 --> 00:10:02.643
It's not a date, doc.

00:10:04.312 --> 00:10:05.313
Patrick.

00:10:05.813 --> 00:10:08.149
It's my job to read people.

00:10:08.232 --> 00:10:11.569
I know a date when I see one.

00:10:11.652 --> 00:10:13.029
Sit down.

00:10:20.411 --> 00:10:21.787
I have a question, doc.

00:10:22.496 --> 00:10:23.539
What is it?

00:10:25.082 --> 00:10:27.001
You can tell me anything, Patrick.

00:10:27.793 --> 00:10:29.503
What's on your mind?

00:10:31.005 --> 00:10:33.424
Why do some people
dress in an unusual way?

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:37.470
Even when it doesn't suit the occasion?

00:10:37.553 --> 00:10:41.390
A little more extravagant,
colorful, unique.

00:10:42.892 --> 00:10:43.976
Weird.

00:10:44.935 --> 00:10:48.522
Well, for some people,
it's a form of expression.

00:10:49.607 --> 00:10:51.025
For others,

00:10:51.734 --> 00:10:55.071
it's a way to protect themselves.

00:10:56.822 --> 00:10:59.033
They want the focus on their outfit,

00:10:59.825 --> 00:11:01.827
so no one sees what's hidden beneath.

00:11:01.911 --> 00:11:04.830
To conceal what
they're really feeling inside.

00:11:06.499 --> 00:11:09.627
So, Patrick, you have to protect Mia.

00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:10.670
What?

00:11:12.088 --> 00:11:14.673
You asked that question because of Mia.

00:11:15.299 --> 00:11:18.344
She's the only one
we know with a unique fashion sense.

00:11:23.891 --> 00:11:26.977
As time goes by, I'm starting to think

00:11:27.603 --> 00:11:29.647
Mia might be similar to her mom.

00:11:31.899 --> 00:11:36.404
That she might have
antisocial personality disorder like her.

00:11:37.405 --> 00:11:39.115
Ingrid was diagnosed with that.

00:11:40.699 --> 00:11:42.785
Mia's mother was your former patient?

00:11:43.411 --> 00:11:44.286
Yes.

00:11:44.995 --> 00:11:46.622
Do you think…

00:11:47.456 --> 00:11:49.959
Mia could possibly
inherit her mother's illness?

00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:54.505
I wasn't able to assess her,
so I can't diagnose.

00:11:55.881 --> 00:11:57.883
I can't say anything yet, but

00:11:57.967 --> 00:12:01.137
if that happens and
Mia develops the condition,

00:12:01.762 --> 00:12:03.472
you'll need to protect her.

00:12:05.224 --> 00:12:06.851
Protect her from what?

00:12:20.239 --> 00:12:23.951
"THE ENCHANTED WITCH"

00:12:26.871 --> 00:12:27.997
Uh!

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:31.667
That's what happens when you meddle.

00:12:32.835 --> 00:12:33.669
Uh.

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:35.880
Is that book yours?

00:12:37.089 --> 00:12:39.049
Do I have to answer your question?

00:12:40.885 --> 00:12:42.511
We're supposed to know

00:12:42.595 --> 00:12:45.764
everything our patients
are preoccupied with here.

00:12:45.848 --> 00:12:47.266
Mmm.

00:12:47.349 --> 00:12:48.767
Oh right.

00:12:50.269 --> 00:12:51.854
I forgot,

00:12:52.605 --> 00:12:56.609
just how nosy the nurses are here.

00:12:59.361 --> 00:13:01.780
Yes, it's mine.

00:13:04.575 --> 00:13:09.497
Does Nurse Olivia know
you have a personal book?

00:13:09.997 --> 00:13:10.998
Yes.

00:13:12.625 --> 00:13:15.544
Well, among all the patients here,

00:13:16.587 --> 00:13:19.340
I've noticed you're
the one who loves reading the most.

00:13:21.592 --> 00:13:23.427
See!

00:13:23.511 --> 00:13:25.012
Nosy!

00:13:26.472 --> 00:13:29.725
That's called being observant, Zelda.

00:13:31.018 --> 00:13:32.811
Well, nurse…

00:13:34.438 --> 00:13:37.816
I hope you've learned your lesson.

00:13:38.484 --> 00:13:41.320
Don't touch things that aren't yours.

00:13:46.825 --> 00:13:48.452
Go get some rest.

00:14:00.506 --> 00:14:03.801
Earlier, was one of the rare times

00:14:04.218 --> 00:14:06.470
Samuel was in
a lucid state of mind, Patrick.

00:14:07.137 --> 00:14:09.223
I was able to talk to him clearly.

00:14:09.557 --> 00:14:10.933
That rarely happens.

00:14:17.147 --> 00:14:20.901
Do you believe
Mia's mother is still alive?

00:14:21.902 --> 00:14:24.864
That it's possible, she could return?

00:14:27.032 --> 00:14:28.534
I'm open to the possibility.

00:14:29.535 --> 00:14:33.372
But if Ingrid does come
back for her husband and child,

00:14:33.998 --> 00:14:35.291
Mia will struggle.

00:14:46.552 --> 00:14:48.554
Hi, bestie!

00:14:48.637 --> 00:14:50.848
Matmat's going to work now.

00:14:51.515 --> 00:14:52.892
Bestie, you're home.

00:14:59.773 --> 00:15:03.027
Bestie? I have a question.

00:15:06.405 --> 00:15:09.199
What kind of girl does Patrick like?

00:15:11.577 --> 00:15:16.665
None… Patpat doesn't like any girl.

00:15:16.749 --> 00:15:18.459
He has no crush.

00:15:20.252 --> 00:15:21.921
Fine.

00:15:22.379 --> 00:15:23.756
No crush.

00:15:25.090 --> 00:15:26.175
But…

00:15:27.176 --> 00:15:29.345
what's his type?

00:15:30.346 --> 00:15:32.348
Tall?

00:15:32.431 --> 00:15:34.725
Talkative or quiet?

00:15:36.143 --> 00:15:37.269
Smart?

00:15:41.398 --> 00:15:43.275
None, really,

00:15:43.359 --> 00:15:45.986
Patpat doesn't like any girl.

00:15:51.408 --> 00:15:52.743
Don't tell me…

00:15:54.244 --> 00:15:56.413
he actually likes boys?

00:15:57.915 --> 00:16:01.210
No… Patpat doesn't like anyone.

00:16:01.293 --> 00:16:03.837
Only Matmat.

00:16:03.921 --> 00:16:07.174
Patpat always says…

00:16:08.676 --> 00:16:12.513
"Matmat, you're my favorite."

00:16:15.599 --> 00:16:17.851
That explains why his life is boring.

00:16:17.935 --> 00:16:19.353
No excitement.

00:16:19.937 --> 00:16:23.065
There is! There's excitement.

00:16:24.692 --> 00:16:28.737
Patpat's happy
whenever he plays with Matmat.

00:16:28.821 --> 00:16:33.826
That's different.
What I mean is, no color, no spice.

00:16:34.368 --> 00:16:36.578
Do you get me, bestie?

00:16:37.162 --> 00:16:40.749
Spice… like in food?

00:16:47.673 --> 00:16:49.091
Here's the thing, bestie.

00:16:55.014 --> 00:16:57.141
I'll make Patrick happy.

00:16:58.058 --> 00:17:01.103
The kind of happiness he'll never forget.

00:17:04.857 --> 00:17:06.025
Mmm…

00:17:07.359 --> 00:17:08.610
Miss Mia,

00:17:09.486 --> 00:17:13.032
you take Satsat.

00:17:14.074 --> 00:17:17.411
You two can play.

00:17:17.494 --> 00:17:21.040
Patpat stays with Matmat.

00:17:21.123 --> 00:17:23.042
We're the ones who'll have fun,

00:17:23.751 --> 00:17:25.544
because we're brothers.

00:17:27.671 --> 00:17:30.215
But aren't we besties?

00:17:31.258 --> 00:17:33.844
Maybe we can share Patrick.

00:17:34.762 --> 00:17:39.475
No, Patpat is only for Matmat.

00:17:41.518 --> 00:17:43.645
But you two are always together.

00:17:44.063 --> 00:17:45.647
Don't you ever get tired of it?

00:17:47.274 --> 00:17:50.360
No, because we're brothers.

00:17:50.736 --> 00:17:53.238
I'm his older brother.

00:17:53.322 --> 00:17:55.074
You never fought?

00:17:55.491 --> 00:17:57.367
Not even once?

00:17:58.702 --> 00:18:02.039
You never wished you weren't siblings?

00:18:10.881 --> 00:18:12.091
Matmat?

00:18:18.055 --> 00:18:19.056
Hello?

00:18:20.224 --> 00:18:21.225
Jason.

00:18:22.643 --> 00:18:26.313
Matmat's working with Miss Mia now.

00:18:28.315 --> 00:18:29.233
Okay.

00:18:54.925 --> 00:18:55.926
Patrick.

00:18:56.468 --> 00:18:57.469
Patrick?!

00:18:59.054 --> 00:19:01.431
Did you hear what I said about Matmat?

00:19:02.141 --> 00:19:03.433
We're besties now.

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:06.937
Ah yes, he mentioned it to me.

00:19:08.772 --> 00:19:12.192
We're now besties,
yet he still won't share.

00:19:21.451 --> 00:19:22.536
Hey!

00:19:23.704 --> 00:19:24.872
Hey!

00:19:24.955 --> 00:19:28.000
What, you're running away
from me again? Huh?

00:19:30.419 --> 00:19:31.545
I'll drive.

00:19:37.384 --> 00:19:38.510

He'd definitely stop me.

Why did you run away?

00:23:04.174 --> 00:23:06.343
Also, can I borrow some
money to pay for our room?

00:23:06.426 --> 00:23:07.969
Are you on your way home, Patpat?

00:23:08.053 --> 00:23:09.846
If you're best friends with Mia,

00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:12.140
you should be inviting her here.

00:23:12.224 --> 00:23:13.892
- She's not around.
- Where's Mia?

00:23:13.975 --> 00:23:16.603
Maybe Patrick is with Miss Mia.
