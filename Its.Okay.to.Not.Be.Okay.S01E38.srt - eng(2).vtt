WEBVTT

00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:02.544
Why did you run away?

00:00:02.627 --> 00:00:04.921
I never had the opportunity
to say a proper goodbye to Bella.

00:00:05.005 --> 00:00:07.674
If Patrick is not holding back anymore,

00:00:07.757 --> 00:00:11.094
maybe I should do
the same with my feelings for Bella.

00:00:11.177 --> 00:00:12.262
They're right.

00:00:12.345 --> 00:00:14.472
Which is why I've
already paid for your room.

00:00:14.556 --> 00:00:15.932
And ours, too.

00:00:16.016 --> 00:00:17.475
They're both gone?

00:00:17.559 --> 00:00:19.936
Maybe Patrick and
Miss Mia are with each other right now.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.521
Are you on your way home, Patpat?

00:00:21.604 --> 00:00:22.856
I might be home in the morning.

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:25.692
You see, I need to accompany someone.

00:00:25.775 --> 00:00:28.111
You've been smiling a lot lately.

00:00:28.194 --> 00:00:30.155
I'm just happy to be with you.

00:00:30.238 --> 00:00:31.573
You make me smile.

00:00:31.656 --> 00:00:33.033
This can't go on forever.

00:00:33.116 --> 00:00:35.118
Mia! Mia!

00:00:35.201 --> 00:00:36.619
Mia, what are you doing?

00:00:36.703 --> 00:00:38.079
Mia! Mia!

00:01:34.427 --> 00:01:35.470
Mia.

00:01:36.721 --> 00:01:39.182
If you don't want to sleep in
their room, you can stay here.

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:42.352
- Okay.
- What do you mean?

00:01:43.144 --> 00:01:44.354
I'll stop bothering you.

00:01:44.437 --> 00:01:46.105
- Promise?
- Mm-hmm.

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:49.776
- I'll hold you to that.
- Mm-hmm.

00:01:57.492 --> 00:01:59.869
Mia, please. Get some sleep already.

00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:19.764
I've been
meaning to do this forever.

00:02:26.312 --> 00:02:27.355
One…

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:29.232
Two…

00:02:30.024 --> 00:02:31.401
- Three!
- Ah!

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.754
- One, two, three…

00:02:51.838 --> 00:02:54.340
One, two, three.

00:02:59.345 --> 00:03:01.306
You look cute when you smile.

00:03:38.426 --> 00:03:40.136
{\an8}-

00:03:43.181 --> 00:03:44.974
{\an8}- What's that?
Hey.

00:03:47.018 --> 00:03:49.854
{\an8}

00:03:52.523 --> 00:03:54.525
{\an8}

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:57.946
{\an8}

00:03:58.029 --> 00:03:59.530
{\an8}Kai, what's that?
Wait, that's alcohol.

00:03:59.614 --> 00:04:01.241
{\an8}You're not going to drink that, are you?

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.620
{\an8}I didn't actually do it, right?

00:04:09.207 --> 00:04:11.918
{\an8}Good thing I was here to stop you.

00:04:13.002 --> 00:04:15.838
{\an8}

00:04:15.922 --> 00:04:17.215
{\an8}See?

00:04:17.298 --> 00:04:20.093
{\an8}Things are better when we're together.

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.973
{\an8}-
I'm sure that belongs to Miss Mia.

00:04:25.056 --> 00:04:26.307
{\an8}You sure about that?

00:04:27.058 --> 00:04:29.477
{\an8}If alcohol's involved,
their definitely up to something.

00:04:30.895 --> 00:04:32.605
{\an8}

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:34.440
{\an8}Hey,
quit peeking! Let's just go.

00:04:34.524 --> 00:04:36.526
{\an8}Let them sleep in peace. Come on.

00:04:38.194 --> 00:04:39.279
{\an8}- Stop it!

00:04:39.362 --> 00:04:40.405
{\an8}Don't be silly.

00:04:41.239 --> 00:04:42.699
{\an8}- Come on.

00:04:44.367 --> 00:04:48.955
{\an8}

00:04:53.918 --> 00:04:56.754
{\an8}-

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:01.634
{\an8}

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:24.615
{\an8}

00:05:36.627 --> 00:05:41.257
{\an8}

00:05:41.716 --> 00:05:44.010
I don't think
I can run from this anymore.

00:05:45.803 --> 00:05:49.182
Ma…

00:05:52.393 --> 00:05:55.938
D-Don't leave Matmat. Please don't.

00:05:58.649 --> 00:06:00.693
Please don't leave, Ma.

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:05.615
P-Please don't leave Patpat.

00:06:13.873 --> 00:06:15.416
Ma!

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:16.709
Ma!

00:06:33.643 --> 00:06:34.894
Patpat?

00:06:37.855 --> 00:06:40.608
Patpat is still not here yet?

00:06:56.165 --> 00:06:58.167
The caller cannot be reached.

00:06:58.251 --> 00:06:59.836
Please try again later.

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:03.339
[sorrowful music continues

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:08.261
You didn't really
sense anything, Doc?

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:12.265
I was so tired
reviewing all our patients.

00:07:12.932 --> 00:07:14.892
I hadn't even
thought to check the backyard.

00:07:17.228 --> 00:07:20.064
Other patients shouldn't know about this.

00:07:20.731 --> 00:07:23.067
This is another blow
to the hospital's image.

00:07:24.277 --> 00:07:26.404
Tommy outsmarted me again.

00:07:31.742 --> 00:07:32.994
Yes, Robert?

00:07:34.412 --> 00:07:37.415
Have you checked
the CCTV footage on the streets?

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:25.338
Patrick?

00:08:50.863 --> 00:08:52.114
Patrick?

00:08:53.991 --> 00:08:55.159
Patrick?

00:09:07.213 --> 00:09:10.174
Don't tell me
you've left me here alone.

00:09:11.425 --> 00:09:12.760
Patrick?

00:09:18.015 --> 00:09:19.183
Patrick?

00:09:33.948 --> 00:09:35.116
Patrick…

00:09:38.619 --> 00:09:41.330
Patrick, next time, tell me first--

00:10:02.852 --> 00:10:04.770
Please don't step on it, okay?

00:10:10.026 --> 00:10:11.402
It's beautiful.

00:10:13.321 --> 00:10:14.655
Just like you.

00:10:26.208 --> 00:10:27.501
Very beautiful.

00:11:49.917 --> 00:11:52.378
Actions speak louder than words.

00:11:53.462 --> 00:11:54.505
That's it?

00:11:54.588 --> 00:11:56.257
You think Gemma's going to say yes

00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:58.968
just because you washed her car?

00:12:00.469 --> 00:12:03.472
Why? You scared I'll outdo your boss?

00:12:03.556 --> 00:12:07.685
Of course! I've got to side with him,
he pays my salary.

00:12:07.768 --> 00:12:09.145
Hey!

00:12:09.228 --> 00:12:11.313
Keep scrubbing. Just help me out here.

00:12:11.397 --> 00:12:12.356
Come on!

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:14.567
- I am helping you.
- Then scrub harder!

00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:17.736
Come on, I'm not the one courting her!
You should be putting in the effort!

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:18.779
You're done?

00:12:18.863 --> 00:12:19.864
- Give me that.
- Here.

00:12:19.947 --> 00:12:23.409
Okay, fine. I'll handle this myself.

00:12:23.492 --> 00:12:27.246
But I'll tell Vincent
this was all your idea.

00:12:27.329 --> 00:12:29.540
That you made Gemma leave her car

00:12:29.623 --> 00:12:31.417
so I could make a move.

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:32.626
That way, I win.

00:12:33.169 --> 00:12:34.545
Hand me the sponge.

00:12:34.628 --> 00:12:35.504
Give me that!

00:12:36.213 --> 00:12:37.882
At least let me do this side,

00:12:37.965 --> 00:12:39.550
that's all I can reach.

00:12:39.633 --> 00:12:42.511
You know, I'm physically challenged.

00:12:43.679 --> 00:12:44.972
I know you can relate.

00:12:45.055 --> 00:12:46.390
See?

00:12:46.474 --> 00:12:47.475
You talk too much.

00:12:47.975 --> 00:12:50.644
- See? You're struggling too.
- Ouch! This hard to reach.

00:12:50.728 --> 00:12:52.229
See?

00:12:52.313 --> 00:12:54.940
You can't reach it, stop pretending.

00:12:55.691 --> 00:12:56.650
Can you reach it then?

00:12:56.734 --> 00:12:58.277
- Of course.
- Come here, I'll lift you.

00:12:58.360 --> 00:12:59.069
Come here.

00:12:59.153 --> 00:13:01.113
I got you.

00:13:01.197 --> 00:13:02.948
You're all about love lives,
never about me!

00:13:03.032 --> 00:13:04.533
You don't care about my heart!

00:13:04.617 --> 00:13:07.786
Even though I'm a strong, independent
girl, I still want a love life!

00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:11.123
I want to be babied sometimes too.
I want to be someone's baby girl.

00:13:11.207 --> 00:13:12.625
You're heavy! Let me put you down.

00:13:12.708 --> 00:13:15.127
- Ouch--Wait!
- Ouch!

00:13:29.517 --> 00:13:33.562
Universe!
I want a love life, but I'm picky.

00:13:33.646 --> 00:13:35.856
- I have standards!
- Hmm!

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:37.316
- Ouch!
- Just go to the other side.

00:13:37.399 --> 00:13:38.400
Whatever!

00:13:42.154 --> 00:13:43.405
Hey, universe!

00:13:44.031 --> 00:13:45.908
You love romcoms too much.

00:13:45.991 --> 00:13:47.993
I'm not amused anymore!

00:13:52.248 --> 00:13:55.209
Good thing I stepped on
those flowers you gave me.

00:13:56.919 --> 00:13:58.754
You really wanted to ruin them?

00:14:00.005 --> 00:14:03.467
If you hadn't pushed me away,
we could've been friends a long time ago.

00:14:03.551 --> 00:14:05.302
If I hadn't rejected you,

00:14:05.386 --> 00:14:08.013
I wouldn't have what I have today.

00:14:08.097 --> 00:14:09.265
And what's that?

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:12.393
This.

00:14:13.352 --> 00:14:14.562
This moment.

00:14:15.896 --> 00:14:17.231
This view.

00:14:18.691 --> 00:14:20.067
Our kiss.

00:14:21.527 --> 00:14:22.987
What we're sharing now.

00:14:29.577 --> 00:14:32.621
Hmm. If we'd gotten closer back then,

00:14:33.789 --> 00:14:35.791
I wonder how things would be now?

00:14:37.418 --> 00:14:39.086
Maybe we'd still be close.

00:14:40.963 --> 00:14:45.676
Or maybe not. We might've realized
we don't even get along.

00:14:45.759 --> 00:14:48.053
Or you and Matmat wouldn't get along.

00:14:48.137 --> 00:14:51.056
Hey! I told you, Matmat's my bestie.

00:14:53.934 --> 00:14:55.311
Maybe…

00:14:58.564 --> 00:15:00.065
Mama would still be alive.

00:15:03.986 --> 00:15:05.154
What do you mean?

00:15:08.365 --> 00:15:10.993
If I hadn't followed
you that night you snuck out…

00:15:12.661 --> 00:15:14.663
I would've gone home with her.

00:15:17.833 --> 00:15:22.296
Go ahead, Ma. I'll catch up.

00:15:23.339 --> 00:15:26.091
Okay, but don't take too long.

00:15:26.175 --> 00:15:28.093
Follow right after, Patpat.

00:15:28.177 --> 00:15:30.220
Patpat, will follow us.

00:15:33.933 --> 00:15:34.934
Mia…

00:15:37.227 --> 00:15:39.396
Maybe I could've protected her…

00:15:40.397 --> 00:15:42.066
from the person who killed her.

00:15:44.944 --> 00:15:45.945
Do you--

00:15:46.779 --> 00:15:48.238
Do you blame me?

00:15:52.618 --> 00:15:54.286
That's why I didn't want to see you.

00:15:56.705 --> 00:15:59.416
Even though Matmat love your books.

00:16:01.919 --> 00:16:03.337
Do you know who I am?

00:16:04.713 --> 00:16:06.215
Mia Hernandez.

00:16:07.424 --> 00:16:09.009
Author of children's book.

00:16:09.093 --> 00:16:10.594
And you are?

00:16:15.641 --> 00:16:16.767
I'll see you soon.

00:16:17.601 --> 00:16:18.519
Thank you.

00:16:18.602 --> 00:16:20.854
But this is the last time we'll meet.

00:16:21.939 --> 00:16:25.025
- I am not leaving!
- I told you, you're not working for her!

00:16:29.071 --> 00:16:31.407
- We'll find another job!

00:16:34.159 --> 00:16:36.870
I didn't want any connection with you.

00:16:40.708 --> 00:16:43.002
Because you reminded me of that night.

00:16:45.379 --> 00:16:46.839
It's not my fault.

00:16:47.548 --> 00:16:49.633
Mia! Mia, I know.

00:16:50.467 --> 00:16:52.052
I shouldn't have thought that way.

00:16:53.137 --> 00:16:55.139
I was wrong. I failed.

00:16:55.556 --> 00:16:57.182
But it wasn't your fault either.

00:16:57.683 --> 00:17:00.769
You had no idea your mother
would run into her killer that night.

00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:03.313
You had no idea what was about to happen.

00:17:04.023 --> 00:17:06.191
And even if you were with them,

00:17:07.067 --> 00:17:08.861
you were just a kid, Patrick.

00:17:08.944 --> 00:17:11.030
Do you really think
you could've saved her?

00:17:11.739 --> 00:17:12.740
I don't know.

00:17:13.157 --> 00:17:14.658
If I couldn't save them,

00:17:14.742 --> 00:17:16.702
I could at least pointed
out who the killer was.

00:17:16.785 --> 00:17:19.204
Who was the person that killed Mama?!

00:17:19.288 --> 00:17:20.956
Try to remember!

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:23.250
We're wasting
our time waiting for your brother!

00:17:23.333 --> 00:17:27.963
- Matmat!

00:17:28.047 --> 00:17:30.382
Matmat wouldn't have been traumatized.

00:17:30.466 --> 00:17:32.426
I would've gotten justice for Mama.

00:17:34.928 --> 00:17:36.305
Patrick.

00:17:36.805 --> 00:17:39.099
You were just a little boy.

00:17:44.021 --> 00:17:46.398
It's unfair that you
are carrying this burden.

00:17:46.482 --> 00:17:48.358
Ugh, I hate this killer!

00:17:48.442 --> 00:17:49.568
You're getting angry for me again.

00:17:49.651 --> 00:17:51.153
Because this person ruined your life!

00:17:51.236 --> 00:17:52.696
But now, I'm with you.

00:17:53.113 --> 00:17:54.698
And I think that will change things.

00:17:54.782 --> 00:17:57.076
Not because I'm enjoying
my time or because I feel relaxed,

00:17:58.952 --> 00:18:02.581
but because you told me
to not burden myself with regret.

00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:11.381
And I will remain
to be that person in your life.

00:18:13.425 --> 00:18:14.927
If you're my safety pin…

00:18:16.345 --> 00:18:20.015
I will be they key to break
away all the chains holding you back.

00:18:45.666 --> 00:18:47.459
Tell me the truth.

00:18:47.543 --> 00:18:48.919
What is Kai planning to do?

00:18:50.587 --> 00:18:54.550
Something bad might
happen to them while he's outside.

00:18:54.925 --> 00:18:55.926
Doc!

00:18:56.343 --> 00:18:59.596
I can sense that nothing
bad is happening to him right now.

00:19:01.098 --> 00:19:02.933
I don't see any dark omens.

00:19:05.561 --> 00:19:07.020
Cynthia.

00:19:07.104 --> 00:19:10.482
I can understand
why you're feeling like that.

00:19:10.566 --> 00:19:14.194
And Doc just wants some reassurance.

00:19:14.278 --> 00:19:16.655
So, just tell us what you know.

00:19:17.531 --> 00:19:18.782
All I know is…

00:19:19.533 --> 00:19:21.660
Kai really misses Bella.

00:19:23.162 --> 00:19:24.288
Nurse…

00:19:25.497 --> 00:19:30.919
Kai just looked, sad inside his room.

00:19:31.003 --> 00:19:35.507
I think he's developed
some kind of depression.

00:19:36.091 --> 00:19:37.426
Mister Tommy.

00:19:37.885 --> 00:19:42.014
If he does have depression,
we'll be the ones to help him.

00:19:42.598 --> 00:19:45.017
Letting him escape is not the solution.

00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:50.522
You haven't answered my question.

00:19:51.148 --> 00:19:52.774
What is Kai planning to do?

00:19:54.318 --> 00:19:56.987
Uh, hmm.

00:19:57.070 --> 00:20:01.491
H-He'll go meet up with Bella, and

00:20:02.242 --> 00:20:04.620
they're going to elope.

00:20:06.914 --> 00:20:07.956
Doc!

00:20:09.249 --> 00:20:13.128
I can really sense
that nothing bad is happening to him.

00:20:13.879 --> 00:20:16.548
Do you know where Kai and Bella are?

00:20:18.258 --> 00:20:19.426
No.

00:20:20.385 --> 00:20:21.595
But,

00:20:22.387 --> 00:20:23.639
Cynthia's right.

00:20:24.264 --> 00:20:26.642
I don't think anything bad has
happened to Kai or Bella because…

00:20:26.725 --> 00:20:30.812
we made sure to tell him
that if they got into a problem,

00:20:31.438 --> 00:20:37.903
they should call one of
the nurses at the reception.

00:20:38.403 --> 00:20:40.906
Check with the other staff
if Kai has called.

00:20:43.575 --> 00:20:45.577
Alright, you may go.

00:20:48.622 --> 00:20:50.040
- Tommy.
- Hmm?

00:20:50.123 --> 00:20:51.708
No extra snacks for you.

00:20:52.542 --> 00:20:54.628
- Come on, Doc!
- Mister Tommy.

00:21:05.347 --> 00:21:06.306
Nurse.

00:21:07.015 --> 00:21:08.517
Can you go make rounds.

00:21:29.162 --> 00:21:32.374
I'll figure out
what you're hiding, Olivia.

00:21:37.254 --> 00:21:39.881
Let me call Kai and
Bella so they can get ready.

00:21:39.965 --> 00:21:41.967
Then, let's head back to Maravida.

00:21:42.426 --> 00:21:43.468
Alright.

00:21:48.307 --> 00:21:49.349
Kai?

00:21:50.559 --> 00:21:51.727
- Kai?
- Sir?

00:21:51.810 --> 00:21:54.104
Are you with those two lovebirds?

00:21:54.187 --> 00:21:57.024
- Yes.
- Can you give them their towel?

00:21:57.107 --> 00:21:59.401
They left it inside their room.

00:21:59.484 --> 00:22:01.111
They might've just gone out.

00:22:01.194 --> 00:22:03.488
Oh sir, their clothes are already gone.

00:22:03.572 --> 00:22:06.325
I saw them leave early this morning.

00:22:07.159 --> 00:22:08.785
Excuse me, sir.

00:22:16.084 --> 00:22:17.127
Kai!

00:22:18.003 --> 00:22:19.254
What happened?

00:22:21.631 --> 00:22:23.425
Where's Bella?

00:22:32.142 --> 00:22:33.685
- Any updates?
- No.

00:22:33.769 --> 00:22:35.854
Patpat hasn't called me yet.

00:22:37.355 --> 00:22:39.316
You need to tell us where Bella is.

00:22:39.399 --> 00:22:42.027
Maybe she didn't really go missing.
Maybe she left him.

00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:44.988
You need
to re-evaluate your system, Eden.

00:22:45.072 --> 00:22:46.281
So I can be more like you?

00:22:46.364 --> 00:22:48.909
Didn't I already tell you?
I see everything.

00:22:48.992 --> 00:22:50.452
Is that you and Matmat?

00:22:50.535 --> 00:22:51.703
Or maybe that's Mia?

00:22:51.787 --> 00:22:53.330
You'd rather be with Miss Mia!

00:22:53.413 --> 00:22:54.998
You don't want to be with Matmat!

00:22:55.082 --> 00:22:56.583
That's not true.
