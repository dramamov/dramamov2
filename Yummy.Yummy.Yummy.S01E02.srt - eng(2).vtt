=Episode 2=

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:48.680
Be careful!

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:51.740
(Yunshui Manor)

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.400
Vice Prefect Lin, sorry.

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.150
Sir, sorry.

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.280
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.120
Get up.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.030
Who are you?

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:18.860
Greetings, Vice Prefect Lin.

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.420
I am Shen Shaoguang.

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.000
My family has a stall in Juxian Alley.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.300
I heard that you've taken office.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.200
Your food on the way
might not be good enough,

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.000
so I came to make
Jianbing Guozi for you,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.140
delivering pancakes to you.

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.100
It's straight
to the Vice Prefect's face.

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:32.060
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:34.500
You are

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:36.700
Shen Shaoguang?

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.140
I'll give you another chance.

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:40.560
Reveal the ringleader,

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:41.940
restore the normal market price,

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:42.860
and never do it again.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.260
Reveal the mastermind.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:45.460
Mastermind?

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.380
I know. It's my sister Shen Shaoguang.

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:48.460
It was all her idea.

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:49.580
She said to have an auction,

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:50.700
and then we'd make a fortune.

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.460
Vice Prefect, you know me?

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.140
I've become so famous so quickly?

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.060
The Pancake Belle?

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.860
Alright.

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.020
Go back now.

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.020
Don't inflate the prices ever again.

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:07.780
Otherwise, you'll be flogged.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:09.580
What do you mean?

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.260
Don't you know

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:13.300
what you've done?

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:16.900
(Yunshui Manor)
Vice Prefect Lin, I...

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.900
Stop!

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:19.260
Auntie.

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.340
So, you just sold out your sister

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.100
right in front of our ancestor?

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.700
I didn't.

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.060
Isn't he our ancestor?

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.020
I knew our family

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:31.720
would definitely love Jianbing Guozi.

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:32.820
So, he had a bad impression

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.220
of me from the start.

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.900
Shen Gongcai, you've ruined everything.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.180
Jicai, instead of complaining about me,

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:40.260
why don't you

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:41.900
think of a way

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.060
to get close to our ancestor

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:44.380
and sneak into Yunshui Manor?

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:45.420
I had a plan, okay?

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:47.580
Well.

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:49.260
Do you have money?

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.340
- I'll buy some other food.
- What?

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.100
All you can do is eat, huh?

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.860
Mom and Dad are working
in the inn's kitchen.

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:56.800
Get up and go help them.

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.060
Sure, I'll go in a bit.

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:00.220
Now.

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.500
I'll go at once.

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:03.340
I'll go.

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:04.820
Get up!

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:05.820
Get up now!

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:06.780
Get up!

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.540
You ruined my plan, and you won't help?

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:09.540
Shen Gongcai!

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:11.380
Did I say I wouldn't go?

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:12.660
Come on.

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:16.220
(A rough start.)

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.060
(Yunshui Manor)
(But our family has loved)

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.580
(Jianbing Guozi for three generations.)

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:20.780
(I just can't believe it.)

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.920
(If I show up
before the ancestor every day,)

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.380
(he'll surely notice me.)

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:27.140
Here.

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.220
The latest flavor we've developed.

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:31.260
Jianbing Guozi.

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:32.940
Salty and sweet options are available.

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:34.900
One qian each for Jianbing Guozi.

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.060
First blood.

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.260
(Hold on,
the ancestor will come eventually.)

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:44.740
Hold tight.

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.500
The latest five-colored Jianbing Guozi.

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.380
Don't miss out as you pass by.

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:55.780
Strike while the iron is hot.

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:57.580
Opportunities don't come every day.

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.180
What a delicious five-colored pancake.

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:03.040
Five-colored pancake.

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.140
Double kill.

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:10.620
Auntie, you're amazing.

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:12.740
I'll take this pancake.

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:13.740
- Tasty.
- Sure.

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:15.120
- I'll take it.
- No pushing.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.820
The curfew is approaching.
Hurry home now.

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:18.300
Triple kill.

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:19.240
We'll leave now.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:27.100
He's coming.

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:31.220
Jianbing Guozi!

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:34.820
Freshly baked Jianbing Guozi!

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:35.980
Delicious and affordable!

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:37.300
Young Master.

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:38.180
It's not pricey.

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:39.620
- I woke up late.
- Jianbing Guozi.

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:40.680
Why didn't you wake me up?

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.000
- Delicious Jianbing Guozi.
- I'll prepare the carriage.

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.400
Delicious and affordable.

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:46.340
Defeat.

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:47.540
Our ancestor

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:49.460
must be the person who dislikes

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:51.660
Jianbing Guozi the most in the world.

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:57.620
(Xuanzheng Gate)

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:58.700
Vice Minister Zhang.

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:01.300
Please wait.

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.760
I am Pei Fei,
the newly appointed Censor.

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.520
(Pei Fei, Censor of the Censorate)
To create a register for Mr. Lin,

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.820
I need the document

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:12.220
from the Ministry of Personnel.

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:13.580
I wonder if you

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:15.180
could do me a favor.

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.020
How could it not be given to you?

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:19.420
They're probably too busy.

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:21.700
Censor Pei, please wait.

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:29.380
Vice Minister Zhang.

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:32.060
I work for His Majesty.

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:34.020
I don't have time to deal
with a document.

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:36.140
Censor Pei, if you keep pestering me...

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:37.700
Vice Minister Zhang.

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:45.260
Vice Prefect Lin.

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:47.980
What do you need?

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:49.660
I've just taken office.

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:51.500
Without a register at the Censorate,

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:52.700
it might affect the evaluation.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:54.660
If you're too busy,

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:56.900
I can get the document myself

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:58.180
and deliver it to Censor Pei.

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:00.940
My subordinates are just too busy.

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:03.940
How could I trouble you
with such a trifle?

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:05.020
Tomorrow morning,

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:07.500
I will send someone
to deliver the document

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:08.980
to the Censorate asap.

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:10.980
Thank you.

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:17.940
Thank you, Vice Prefect Lin.

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:20.500
I've heard that you live far away.

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:22.980
Did you have breakfast before court?

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:28.420
(Capital Prefecture)

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:29.860
Every time I went to the Personnel,

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:32.300
(Capital Prefecture)
Mr. Zhang could always find an excuse.

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:34.660
And you asked me to share your carriage

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:36.340
and have a meal at your residence.

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:37.700
If others see this,

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:39.820
they will surely think we are close.

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:42.140
If anyone wants
to make things hard for me,

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:44.180
they will have to think twice.

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:46.300
I really don't know

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:48.140
how to repay your kindness.

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:50.180
I'm also someone
in a foreign land alone.

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:51.660
I can really empathize.

00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:53.940
Censor Pei, don't take it to heart.

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:55.540
Young Master.

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:56.580
Censor Pei.

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:09.500
Thank you.

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:10.740
Censor Pei,

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:11.700
please.

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:16.780
You prefer light flavors?

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:17.940
Not particularly.

00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:20.540
I just don't think it's necessary
to fuss over food.

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:22.040
Food is to fill my stomach.

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:23.380
If you're not used to it,

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:24.740
I can arrange something else.

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:26.420
No, no, I'm used to it.

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:27.980
I grew up in the countryside.

00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:30.140
I'm very used to eating like this.

00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:37.100
You helped me a lot today

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:38.580
and even treated me to a meal.

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:40.340
I should return the favor.

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:41.980
There's no need to be so polite.

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:43.740
No, no, I must insist.

00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:46.380
You can't possibly refuse a meal,
can you?

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:52.580
(Yunshui Manor)

00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:57.460
Fortunately,

00:08:57.780 --> 00:08:59.300
Father bought Yunshui Manor

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:00.580
under someone else's name.

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:03.120
It wasn't listed
in the confiscation inventory,

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:05.300
so I could buy it back.

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:06.780
17 years ago,

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:08.840
when your father served as the Prefect,

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:11.120
he was imprisoned
for selling official positions.

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:14.220
The Censorate at that time
was all over him.

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:15.680
The Cui family was slandered,

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:17.700
and they had no small part in it.

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:21.380
Why bother with Pei Fei?

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:24.260
At that time, Censor Pei
was still at home mourning

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:25.820
and hadn't taken up his post here.

00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:26.660
What does this

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:28.500
have to do with him?

00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:32.060
If we're talking about zodiac signs,

00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:33.660
you should be a vengeful one.

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:35.100
How could you not care?

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:38.820
You think Pei Fei might be useful
when you need

00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:40.820
to investigate the Censorate, right?

00:09:58.300 --> 00:09:59.300
(Be cautious.)

00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:12.260
My father used to keep all his books

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:13.260
and notes in the study.

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:15.300
Perhaps we can find some clues there.

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:18.220
Everyone outside
has been taken care of, right?

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:19.380
Don't worry.

00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:21.260
Even a mouse

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:22.500
wouldn't get in here.

00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:34.260
(Langhuan Chamber)

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:45.140
Father built this hidden door secretly.

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:47.200
Yunshui Manor
has been abandoned for years,

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:48.380
so no one has discovered it.

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:53.460
What kind of lock is this?

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:55.220
Your father made it.

00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:57.020
He found it years ago.

00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:58.860
Seemingly from the Western Regions.

00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:01.180
Only my mother and he
knew how to open it.

00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:03.140
They never allowed me to play in here,

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:04.540
always keeping this place locked.

00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:05.860
So, you don't know

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:08.160
how to open it?

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:10.440
It shouldn't be too hard.

00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:18.540
There's no keyhole.

00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:30.500
Very well.

00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:32.280
Interesting.

00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:55.340
(Congrats on getting a free tasting)

00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:04.220
Auntie, you're so amazing.

00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:06.120
How did you come up with this idea?

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:07.320
It's because of our ancestor.

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:09.180
I don't believe

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:11.340
he can resist the temptation
of a free meal.

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:14.620
(Jingsi Study)

00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:16.460
Young Master,

00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:20.100
are we really stuck

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:21.460
by a Western Regions lock?

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:22.900
Don't worry.

00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:24.120
We'll figure it out eventually.

00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:41.260
(Jingsi Study)

00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:43.780
What is this?

00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:09.540
(Congrats on getting a free tasting
at Shen's Diner)

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:14.900
Didn't you say

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:17.540
not even a mouse would get in here?

00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:19.940
I'll go find them right now.

00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:20.980
Come back.

00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:29.280
Shen's Diner?

00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:32.020
The ones who were selling pancakes

00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:33.100
are the Shens, right?

00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:35.020
That's right.

00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:36.660
If it really is them,

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.300
the way they write, fold things,

00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:41.780
run their business, and they talk...

00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:42.920
Everything seems a bit odd.

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:45.140
It's as if they're trying

00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:47.140
to get my attention.

00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:49.980
Could it be

00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:53.780
that someone has discovered your secret?

00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:01.860
(Minfu Inn)

00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:07.660
I've drawn for four hours.

00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:11.300
How could someone
not be interested in a free meal?

00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:14.380
Auntie, should we give up?

00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:16.260
Let's think of another way.

00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:22.180
My god, give me a miracle.

00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:23.380
Tell me how I can get in touch

00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:25.300
with our ancestor.

00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:50.740
How should I treat
the Vice Prefect to a meal?

00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:52.980
This is all too expensive.

00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:56.620
My monthly salary won't cover it.

00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:09.660
(Congrats)
Anyone holding this flyer

00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:13.460
can enjoy a free tasting

00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:16.260
at Earth Room I, Minfu Inn.

00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:25.740
Censor Pei,
where are you taking me to eat?

00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:28.100
You're new here.

00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:30.180
You probably don't know much
about Yong'an.

00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:31.420
As the saying goes,

00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:34.000
the best delicacies in the world
are in Yong'an,

00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:36.380
and the best dishes of Yong'an
are in Juxian Alley.

00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:39.020
The place we're going to eat at

00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:40.780
is a diner that's about to open

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:42.860
in Juxian Alley.

00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:44.380
Before it officially opens,

00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:46.620
they're offering

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:49.260
free tastings.

00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:51.540
Free tastings?

00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:53.580
Yes.

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:57.380
Did you receive

00:15:57.740 --> 00:15:58.980
that winning flyer?

00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:00.660
You also know that?

00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:03.300
I was actually worried

00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:04.540
that I'm short on money,

00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:05.780
and inviting you to a meal

00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:07.260
that's a free tasting

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:08.420
might upset you.

00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:11.500
Judging by your expression,

00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:13.940
could it be that you also
kept that flyer,

00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:16.940
thinking of going
for a free tasting someday?

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:19.620
That's perfect.

00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:22.500
Let's go for the free tasting right now.

00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:33.580
It's almost curfew time.

00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:35.180
The ancestor won't come.

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:36.040
Yangyang,

00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:38.420
go to the kitchen and tell Grandpa
not to heat the dishes.

00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:39.740
It's been reheated many times.

00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:45.420
Let's just eat already.

00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:53.460
Auntie, cheer up.

00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:54.620
Grandma always said

00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:56.620
that sighing
would let fortune slip away.

00:16:58.140 --> 00:17:00.020
There we go; the fortune is back.

00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:05.820
Is this the place for the free tasting?

Please come in.

(Earth Room 1)
To Mr. Pei and Mr. Lin,

00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:16.420
let's drink.

00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:17.420
Come on, come on.

00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:18.420
Cheers.

00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:19.500
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:21.060
- We'll drink first.
- Cheers.

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:27.540
Mr. Lin, why didn't you drink?

00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:31.980
This is kinda inappropriate, right?

00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:33.020
Mr. Lin,

00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:34.780
it was indeed wrong of us

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:36.300
to inflate the prices before.

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:37.220
Drink this cup,

00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:38.940
and don't hold it
against us anymore, okay?

00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:39.820
Yes.

00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:40.860
Sorry.

00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:42.140
I don't drink alcohol.

00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:45.460
- Let me tell you something.
- Auntie,

00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:46.780
what does he mean?

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:47.960
He doesn't drink alcohol.

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:50.400
People in this era like to say that.
It's more pretentious.

00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:51.820
What is this?

00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:53.860
You're being boring.

00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:55.740
This is called lobster.

00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:58.260
It's the highest honor
we offer to our guests.

00:17:58.260 --> 00:17:59.660
- Try it.
- But

00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:01.260
since we can't get the ingredient,

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:03.780
we can only use steamed buns
as a substitute.

00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:05.620
How about it?

00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:06.820
Give it a try.

00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:08.380
Yes, try it.

00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:09.900
Please try it.

00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:10.980
- Lobster?
- Here.

00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:11.820
Yes.

00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:14.260
- Vice Prefect, try it.
- Try it.

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:15.220
Delicious.

00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:17.300
You're not eating or drinking.

00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:18.380
That's not okay.

00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:19.780
You have to drink.

00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:20.700
Yes.

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:21.620
I don't drink alcohol.

00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:23.260
We can't drink anymore.

00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:24.940
Curfew is coming soon.

00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:26.740
We can't leave the living area
during curfew.

00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:29.460
I have to go back before curfew.

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:32.300
There's even less to worry about.

00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:34.180
Just stay here and drink.

00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:35.020
If you're drunk,

00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:36.640
- stay here.
- Yes.

00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:37.620
We can make room, right?

00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:39.460
Just stay here for the night.

00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:40.420
Vice Prefect,

00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:43.380
you have to drink for my sake.

00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:45.940
There's no official
who doesn't drink, right?

00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:47.580
- Yes.
- If you don't drink this wine,

00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:48.500
that means

00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:49.860
you haven't forgiven us, right?

00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:50.800
You haven't forgiven us.

00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:53.740
I didn't mean it that way.

00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:56.180
Then just drink this.

00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:58.380
- Just one cup.
- Just one cup.

00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:01.000
It seems you are determined

00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:02.620
to persuade me to drink this cup.

00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:03.900
That's not true.

00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:04.900
I'll drink first.

00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:09.220
Look, she's drinking.

00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:16.140
Good, good.

00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:17.060
You can indeed drink.

00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:18.360
We'll join you.

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:19.500
- We'll join you.
- Come on.

00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:21.220
- Mr. Pei, join us.
- I'll have some soup.

00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:22.700
Vice Prefect, let me tell you.

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:24.340
Where there's a first, there's a second.

00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:25.540
Let's drink again.

00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:26.940
I can't hold my drink.

00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:28.460
You can.

00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:29.940
Then I shall drink with you.

00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:31.660
Great, come on.

00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:33.220
Come on.

00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:54.460
Vice Prefect Lin?

00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:55.300
Vice Prefect?

00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:57.340
- Vice Prefect Lin?
- Vice Prefect?

00:19:57.780 --> 00:19:59.100
Finally touched the real person.

00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:00.580
What are you doing?

00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:02.180
This is our ancestor.

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:06.100
Jicai and I have already found out.

00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:08.880
In the backyard of Yunshui Manor,

00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:11.060
there's a gap when the guards
change shifts at night.

00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:12.460
If we can find the key

00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:13.860
and avoid the curfew patrol,

00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:14.740
we'll have a chance

00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:16.940
and sneak in before he sobers up.

00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:19.780
Hurry up, or he'll sober up.

00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:21.180
- Hurry up.
- Come on.

00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:22.500
Be quiet.

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:26.380
Slow down.

00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:33.980
It's okay; keep going.

00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:48.780
I can't find the key.

00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:50.340
We can't find it.

00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:51.740
Can you two do this?

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:53.340
Let me do it.

00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:54.460
- Jicai.
- You do it.

00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:09.380
(In this era,)

00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:11.540
(does the master even carry keys?)

00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:14.060
(Should we get
his attendant drunk instead?)

00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:15.920
(Maybe it's hidden inside his clothes?)

00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:24.420
What are you going to do to me?

00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:27.940
Stop!

00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:37.980
This isn't really happening, is it?

00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:38.820
Grandma.

00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:44.420
(Our ancestor didn't pick)

00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:46.580
(those things to target us, did he?)

00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:48.380
(Yes, yes.)

00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:50.860
(He can't mean to hurt us, can he?)

00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:51.860
(Grandpa said)

00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:53.660
(that before Lin Yan married)

00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:54.780
(Lady Shen,)

00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:56.420
(he used to be quite ruthless.)

00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:05.100
Gongcai, wake up.

00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:06.660
- What's wrong with you?
- Dad.

00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:08.500
So easily frightened.

00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:10.540
Then let's start with him.

00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:11.380
Yes.

00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:12.500
Gongcai, Gongcai.

00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:13.780
No, Dad.

00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:15.380
Wake up, Dad!

00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:16.940
- Don't touch him.
- Dad.

00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:19.180
After all this trouble,

00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:21.300
you just wanted to get me drunk.

00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:22.820
How about this?

00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:24.360
I'll kill one of you first

00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:25.660
to serve as a warning.

00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:26.900
Then,

00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:29.140
you'll be willing to reveal

00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:31.180
your identities and purposes, right?

00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:33.540
No, no, no.

00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:34.420
Don't, don't.

00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:35.300
Ancestor, Ancestor.

00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:36.980
Please, have mercy.

00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:38.820
Don't kill us,
especially not me, Ancestor.

00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:39.960
Who said I'm your ancestor?

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:43.220
- Dad.
- I'm sorry. We're sorry.

00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:44.740
Please, I'm begging you.

00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:48.960
- Let go of my aunt.
- What are you up to?

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:49.960
We're sorry, we're sorry.

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:50.740
Auntie.

00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:52.380
Please spare my daughter.

00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:53.300
Please don't.

00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:54.700
We aren't up to anything.

00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:56.260
- Vice Prefect.
- I'll count to three.

00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:57.330
- Vice Prefect.
- No, no.

00:22:57.340 --> 00:22:58.380
- Three.
- No.

00:22:58.380 --> 00:22:59.420
We aren't up to anything.

00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:00.820
Two.

00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:03.940
Vice Prefect.

00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:05.340
One.

00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:09.100
Actually, you're my fiancé.

00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:15.260
(Jicai, are you crazy?)

00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:16.580
(This is our ancestor.)

00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:19.100
(When your grandpa told you
about our ancestor,)

00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:22.220
(did he say he had a fiancée
before he married into our family?)

00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:24.100
(He didn't mention it,)

00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:25.860
(but those romance novels my mom loves)

00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:26.820
(are always like this.)

00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:28.180
(The ruthless tycoon)

00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:29.580
(always has a mysterious fiancée.)

00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:30.480
(It's a common plot.)

00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:32.480
(I admit I'm taking a gamble.)

00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:34.780
(Oh, no, it's all over.)

00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:39.580
(Don't panic yet.)

00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:41.220
(Judging by the ancestor's look,)

00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:42.700
(did Jicai actually guess right?)

00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:46.700
You say

00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:50.980
you're my fiancée?

00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:53.020
Do you have any proof?

00:23:55.580 --> 00:23:57.540
I know your real identity.

00:23:58.580 --> 00:23:59.580
Qingyang,

00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:01.340
Cui Che.

00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:12.100
Vice Prefect Lin,

00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:13.860
originally named Cui Che,

00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:16.140
was from Qingyang County.

00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:17.940
When he was eight years old,

00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:19.300
his father

00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:21.460
committed a capital offense.

00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:24.620
The Cui family was exterminated.

00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:26.060
Only he

00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:28.780
was fortunate enough to be saved.

00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:32.700
He changed his name,
registered elsewhere, and survived.

00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:36.740
Go on.

00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:41.220
The Cui family was exterminated.

00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:44.740
You changed your name
and registered elsewhere

00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:45.940
to be safe.

00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:54.180
But the family I was engaged to

00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:56.340
didn't have the surname Shen.

00:24:56.980 --> 00:24:58.680
We were promised
in marriage before birth.

00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:00.340
When the tragedy happened,

00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:02.220
you were only eight years old.

00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:05.260
It's not strange
that you forgot my family name.

00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:08.580
Poor you,
losing your family at a young age.

00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:11.420
You can't remember many things, can you?

00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:14.740
But please, rest easy.

00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:16.340
We in business

00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:17.540
know what to do.

00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:20.300
Since I'm your fiancée,

00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:21.820
we're practically relatives.

00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:25.260
Why? We're not married.

00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:28.300
It doesn't matter.

00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:30.780
Anyway,

00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:32.860
we won't breathe a word

00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:34.100
about your secret to anyone.

00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:36.380
Think about it.

00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:37.480
We're related by marriage.

00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:38.540
If we harm you,

00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:40.140
we'd be implicated too, right?

00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:44.020
Yes, yes.

00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:16.100
When you interrogated us earlier,

00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:17.740
we indeed hid something.

00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:19.340
Please let us stay

00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:21.900
in Yunshui Manor.

00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:26.540
You want to use me

00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:27.980
to live in Yunshui Manor?

00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:31.220
You could have just asked.

00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:32.700
Why go through all this trouble?

00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:34.740
So, you mean...

00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:36.260
Absolutely impossible.

00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:40.500
I've actually thought of this answer.

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:42.260
A dignified Vice Prefect,

00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:43.900
who eats a free meal at others' expense,

00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:45.900
yet doesn't allow others
to do the same to him.

00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:47.500
In that case,

00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:49.460
to have a place to stay,

00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:51.300
I have to use unconventional methods.

00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:53.420
Mr. Pei, Mr. Pei.

00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:54.780
Please get up and help me.

00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:56.700
- Vice Prefect Lin abandoned me.
- Nonsense.

00:26:56.820 --> 00:26:58.760
Mr. Pei, speak up for me.

00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:00.220
- Mr. Lin got promoted...
- Shut up.

00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:01.660
He abandoned his wife.

00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:07.100
Young Master.

00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:12.380
Do you want to die?

00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:14.780
You touched my mouth.

00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:16.660
Now, we're not only engaged

00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:17.900
but also have physical intimacy.

00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:19.500
You must take responsibility for me.

00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:21.420
If you don't let us stay
in Yunshui Manor,

00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:23.780
I'll go to the streets and cry
about your abandonment.

00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:27.580
I'll count to three.

00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:29.100
One.

00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:30.620
Two.

00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:31.860
Three.

00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:35.580
Everyone, please judge for me.

00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:36.580
Vice Prefect Lin, he...

00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:37.660
I agree.

00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:42.580
How virtuous of you.

00:27:42.580 --> 00:27:44.420
You won't stoop to my level.

00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:45.900
I'm truly grateful.

00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:47.980
You're a gentleman
who values your promises.

00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:49.900
I believe you won't go back
on your word.

00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:51.020
I also promise you

00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:52.060
that I won't reveal

00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:53.540
anything I know to anyone else.

00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:54.500
Not a third person...

00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:56.140
Not an eighth person in this world

00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:01.300
will know about our relationship.

00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:04.720
(With important matters at hand,)

00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:06.160
(this family is really suspicious.)

00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:07.620
(I'll take them back)

00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:09.420
(and clear things up.)

00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:13.700
(Yunshui Manor)

00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:15.700
(Virtue and Fragrance)

00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:16.700
Yunshui Manor

00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:18.140
is not quite the same

00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:19.500
as the modern one.

00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:20.620
Yes, it's not the same.

00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:22.120
Can we really stay here for free?

00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:23.180
I'm afraid Vice Prefect Lin

00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:25.140
won't ask for money,
but he'll ask for our lives.

00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:27.420
Don't talk nonsense and scare Yangyang.

00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:29.780
Here he comes.

00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:30.940
Here he comes.

00:28:34.420 --> 00:28:35.380
Vice Prefect.

00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:37.020
Vice Prefect.

00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:39.540
If you stay in Yunshui Manor for now,

00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:41.420
others will surely gossip.

00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:43.740
Although we were engaged,

00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:46.060
we're not married after all.

00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:47.600
I really don't know

00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:49.940
what basis there is for us
to live under the same roof.

00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:52.260
Are you going back on your word?

00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:53.540
We've already moved

00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:55.100
all our luggage here.

00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:56.100
- You...
- No way.

00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:57.640
- Yes.
- I have to carry it all back?

00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:00.940
I'm just worried

00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:03.060
that if there's not even a proper basis,

00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:04.860
when my colleagues find out,

00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:06.980
they'll impeach me for a messy life.

00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:10.100
How should Lady Shen
and I explain ourselves?

00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:11.980
I read Dream of the Red Chamber...

00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:15.540
I read in a book

00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:16.780
that relatives can live together

00:29:16.780 --> 00:29:18.520
in an emergency,
even if they're unmarried.

00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:20.700
Besides, we have so many elders here.

00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:22.380
You can just tell people

00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:24.500
that I'm your cousin.

00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:26.700
We've fallen on hard times
and came for help.

00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:27.980
- Yes.
- Yes, yes.

00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:30.540
We're all relatives.

00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:33.820
Alright.

00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:35.420
It can hold off for a while.

00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:37.700
Thank you, Vice Prefect.

00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:40.900
(This guy)

00:29:41.060 --> 00:29:42.780
(clearly guided us to propose)

00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:44.060
(to live as relatives)

00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:47.580
(and made us feel
like we're troubling him.)

00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:49.340
(As expected of our ancestor.)

00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:51.100
(Also a cunning merchant.)

00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:53.900
You reluctantly took us in,

00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:55.500
and we're reasonable people.

00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:57.740
The youngest Vice Prefect in history

00:29:57.740 --> 00:29:59.020
can't have an unmarried wife

00:29:59.020 --> 00:30:00.420
from the countryside like me.

00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:02.580
Calling us cousins is the best solution.

00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:03.700
I understand the rules.

00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:06.000
The first step to success is
to cut ties with your lover.

00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:10.180
The first step to success is
to cut ties with your lover?

00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:14.180
It means I know you don't want

00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:15.580
to marry me.

00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:20.860
You're not like an ordinary young lady.

00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:22.100
You don't seem sad

00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:23.940
after losing your marriage.

00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:26.820
No.

00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:29.540
I'm just putting on a brave face.

00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:32.900
She's very sad.

00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:34.500
Yes, quite upset.

00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:39.540
The west wing is ready.

00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:40.380
Everyone,

00:30:40.580 --> 00:30:41.940
you can settle down here for now.

00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:44.540
Thank you, Vice Prefect.

00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:46.060
Thank you, thank you.

00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:49.020
Liu Chang.

00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:50.100
Everyone,

00:30:50.540 --> 00:30:51.420
please.

00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:52.580
Alright, alright.

00:30:53.420 --> 00:30:54.580
Let's go pick rooms.

00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:56.420
What about me? You're leaving?

00:30:56.820 --> 00:30:57.780
Auntie, hurry up.

00:30:58.980 --> 00:30:59.920
- Slow down.
- Hurry.

00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:01.260
At least help me carry something.

00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:09.460
(Start Near to Go Far)

00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:17.380
Lady Shen.

00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:19.420
Vice Prefect Lin.

00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:21.540
Ancestors,

00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:23.340
we've offended you.

00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:25.420
Please forgive us.

00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:31.660
Lady Shen, I had no other choice

00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:33.020
but this desperate measure.

00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:34.860
Who knew it'd actually work?

00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:35.820
Yes.

00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:37.060
If we hadn't said that,

00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:38.860
Vice Prefect Lin would've killed us.

00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:40.580
We were left with no other option.

00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:43.660
But it was mostly Jicai's idea.

00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:44.740
She's the mastermind.

00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:46.260
You brat.

00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:49.180
Ancestors,

00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:51.260
we truly had no idea

00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:53.180
that Vice Prefect Lin had a fiancée

00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:54.540
before he married into our family.

00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:56.140
You two

00:31:56.540 --> 00:31:57.980
will have to sort it out

00:31:57.980 --> 00:31:59.980
down there in the afterlife.

00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:02.780
What's the matter now?

00:32:02.780 --> 00:32:04.140
Is this the point?

00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:06.100
You can't even repent properly.

00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:09.380
Ancestors,

00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:12.260
we will find a way back asap

00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:14.060
to end this absurdity.

00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:15.600
We've offended you greatly.

00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:16.700
Please forgive us.

00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:17.980
Forgive us.

00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:19.020
We're really sorry.

00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:21.900
Sorry, sorry.

00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:23.670
- Sorry, Ancestors.
- I'm sorry.

00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:24.940
I'm sorry.

00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:26.740
Jicai,

00:32:27.540 --> 00:32:29.180
do you think that such a big lie

00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:31.260
might cause a butterfly effect?

00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:32.700
Because we changed the past,

00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:34.100
it might affect the future?

00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:35.580
That would be bad.

00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:37.060
Then there wouldn't be us, right?

00:32:37.250 --> 00:32:38.100
Yes. Well...

00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:39.400
There's no other way.

00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:41.420
If we hadn't said that,
there would be no future.

00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:42.860
We'd have been killed at once.

00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:51.380
Yangyang, come here.

00:32:52.060 --> 00:32:54.040
- What's that sound?
- Someone seems to be there.

00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:55.020
As expected.

00:32:55.740 --> 00:32:56.900
What do you mean?

00:33:00.580 --> 00:33:02.980
He's spying on us as expected.

00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:07.860
What do you mean?

00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:10.320
I only understood "black".

00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:12.060
It's he.

00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:22.940
(Permutations and combinations)

00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:45.820
Young Master.

00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:49.500
This family

00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:50.860
hasn't slept.

00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:53.380
They're huddled together, muttering.

00:33:53.580 --> 00:33:55.580
I can't quite make out
what they're saying.

00:33:56.060 --> 00:33:58.340
What do you plan to do next?

00:33:58.980 --> 00:34:00.940
They went through all this trouble
to get here.

00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:02.940
They won't just stay quietly.

00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:04.140
Wait for them to move.

00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:08.180
Liu Chang,

00:34:09.540 --> 00:34:11.940
my parents did arrange
a marriage for me,

00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:13.620
but as far as I can remember,

00:34:14.220 --> 00:34:15.580
she was a Zheng,

00:34:16.140 --> 00:34:17.060
not a Shen.

00:34:17.460 --> 00:34:18.440
Do you remember anything?

00:34:18.700 --> 00:34:20.860
I've been in the Cui family
since I was young,

00:34:21.220 --> 00:34:23.620
but I've always been doing odd jobs.

00:34:24.700 --> 00:34:26.220
I've never heard of these things.

00:34:31.140 --> 00:34:31.980
Look.

00:34:32.220 --> 00:34:34.100
I just taught him
how to make a Sinan chariot,

00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:36.340
and he's been busy with it all day.

00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:43.340
Father, Mother.

00:34:43.580 --> 00:34:45.060
Father, I've learned how to make this.

00:34:45.060 --> 00:34:45.900
Let me see.

00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:50.500
This is so exquisite.

00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:52.060
Good, good.

00:34:53.660 --> 00:34:54.900
The Sinan chariot can be used

00:34:55.540 --> 00:34:58.180
for transporting goods during war,

00:34:59.140 --> 00:35:01.820
but it doesn't mean
it's always a good thing.

00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:03.580
Our family

00:35:03.820 --> 00:35:05.420
should be good generals during wartime,

00:35:06.060 --> 00:35:07.060
protecting our country,

00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:08.820
- but we still hope...
- But we still hope

00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:12.100
that every day is as peaceful as today,

00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:14.300
and we only need to be loyal,

00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:16.280
- protecting the people.
- Protecting the people.

00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:19.020
Alright, I won't say more.

00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:20.900
Your mother will tell you.

00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:25.780
Che, actually,

00:35:25.780 --> 00:35:28.380
we have arranged
a marriage for you today.

00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:30.020
When you grow up,

00:35:30.020 --> 00:35:31.900
you must treat the young lady well.

00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:33.380
Why arrange a marriage?

00:35:33.940 --> 00:35:35.220
What's the use of a wife?

00:35:35.740 --> 00:35:37.860
She can't make a Sinan chariot for me.

00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:39.300
Che,

00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:41.740
because we

00:35:41.740 --> 00:35:43.300
can't be with you forever,

00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:46.740
so we hope you can have your own family.

00:35:47.340 --> 00:35:49.980
Don't you always want to be a great man?

00:35:50.660 --> 00:35:53.180
A great man should be like your father,

00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:55.620
accountable to friends,
relatives, and family,

00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:57.580
and live up to the people and the world.

00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:11.500
Check thoroughly.

00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:19.360
Don't leave anyone behind.

00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:20.700
Mother.

00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:23.900
Young Master, calm down.

00:36:42.620 --> 00:36:44.380
My leg seems to be broken.

00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:46.380
I can't walk.

00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:47.260
Search carefully.

00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:48.940
Leave no one alive.

00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:55.300
Young Master,

00:36:55.540 --> 00:36:56.580
why don't you

00:36:56.980 --> 00:36:58.380
just leave me behind?

00:37:00.420 --> 00:37:02.300
I'm just a servant
in the outer courtyard.

00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:03.740
Your family

00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:05.700
has always treated me well.

00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:07.820
I can't let

00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:11.020
the last Cui die

00:37:12.060 --> 00:37:13.460
because of me.

00:37:13.470 --> 00:37:14.380
Shut up, Liu Chang.

00:37:14.380 --> 00:37:15.220
Look further inside.

00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:18.740
Do you want to draw everyone here?

00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:20.580
We're not at a dead end yet.

00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:22.180
Let me carry you.

00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:24.540
Che,

00:37:24.940 --> 00:37:26.860
your father would never do such a thing.

00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:28.660
You must survive,

00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:30.220
find out the truth,

00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:31.980
and clear our family's name.

00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:38.740
But so many years have passed.

00:37:38.980 --> 00:37:41.540
Your appearance has changed greatly.

00:37:42.340 --> 00:37:43.580
How did this family

00:37:43.580 --> 00:37:45.620
recognize you?

00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:48.440
For the next few days,

00:37:48.540 --> 00:37:49.700
keep a close eye on them.

00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:51.980
I'll also find an opportunity

00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:53.660
to probe their background.
